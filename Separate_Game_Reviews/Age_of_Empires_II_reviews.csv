"When I was a child I would play this game. Now I bought it a second time because I want to be a child again... This is a game where you make an Empire that lasts through the Ages... Also when a friend of mine was telling me about this game when I was in third grade, he thought that it was called Agent Vampires. A game that has nothing to do with agents or vampires. Anyway, good game if you have friends who also want to be kids again."
"Just nominated this for the test of time award. Honestly who hasn't heard of age of empires? A lot of grew up with it and other titles like warcraft and command and conquer but look at it. Age of empires II is still played to this very day by a lot of people, and for a good reason! Since this game came out ages ago it has had tons of bugs fixed, a lot of balancing work went into it and new civs were added that fit into the game nicely and enrich the overall experience while still staying true to the core. It does't need super fancy visuals, it doesn't need you to have korean progamer levels of apm to enjoy it. It comes from a time when games were just about having fun, and it still is! Do yourself a favor and give it a try."
"Oh boy, where do I begin? I've been playing this game since it was released as a demo for maximum pc back in 1998. My father showed me it at a computer store that he used to work at in the small community that we used to live in. I was only 4 years old at that time, and I remember the only civilizations you could be were the Brits and Celts. I first laid eyes on the scout calvary, would ignore the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything else, because he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age. Since then, Ive been playing this game on and off, I'm 21 now, and I still find myself latched on to it. I now have a daughter of my own, although she won't know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 years, she will still know how it came to be, assuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up. I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civ, while still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in it's own ways. I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2006-2009 with all of my friends, for the most part, I came out on top, even had our own little community of players, formed our own club, and we made a board game out of it. It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played this, at least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we did, and there was no discrimination involved in any of it. We amassed to a total of 20 or more people in this community, and for a small amount of us, our community is still strong with new members and old. This game is called Age of Empires II, and it will stand the test of time for the ages. I'm happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years later, and we're still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before. I've come to realize that just since early 2014 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this game, teaching people both young and old what to do in this game. I'm so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this day, even after 16 years. I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 2004 without the package being opened or torn, I would keep it as a collector's item, this game has so much potential and I'm happy to see that it's not being thrown away in to the trash. I honestly believe that when I die of old age, assuming that I don't die any other way, I will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations later, people will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone else's life. I honestly didn't even play the Conqueror's expansion pack until 2007, even though I knew about it unpon release date, my mother refused me video games, so I never got to play it on time like most of my friends did, but I knew that I would at some point in time. Due to my parents seperation back in 2001 shortly after my mother's mother died, I ended up living with my mother, as she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father. Whenever I was with him, he would let me play games, even though it was against my mother's wishes. I really loved playing as the Celts, Britons, Franks, Goths, and Vikings, at the time, they were my favorite. Now and again however, you will find me riding along Genghis Khan's horde as the Mongols, however, you can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions. I love all of the civilizations very much, I know that they all have their strengths and weaknesses, some are greater than others. My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage. I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun. I can't wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 2015 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors. I hope you all have a try at this game, it's for sure my favorite game of all time."
"Playing FFA Regicide with friends. Using the Game of Thrones soundtrack add-on for extra epicness. After an hour of warfare, alliances, and betrayal, my city falls and I brace myself for defeat. Suddenly, I see a message: 'Anon has changed their status with you to ally.' He lets me bring my king and villagers to his city for protection. He tells me to hide my king near his castles for protection. Under his protection, I begin to rebuild my empire. After a few minutes, I see another message. 'Anon has changed their status with you to enemy.' I watch as the crossbowmen in his castle execute my king. The Rains of Castamere begin to play, mocking my defeat. It was at this moment I realized how amazing Age of Empires II was.  True story"
"  Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in    AOE gamer through the years... "
First PC game I ever played and 11 years later I'm still playing it. I think that sums up this review.
"One of the RTS classics alongside C&amp;C &amp; Starcraft, Age of Empires 2 is brought remastered on steam. Now supporting all HD resolutions, reworked terrain, water &amp; building textures/sprites, it definetly looks better than it did a decade ago. Gameplay is left mostly untouched, with the only notable change being a pop cap increase to 500. Multiplayer is handled through steam, meaning (generally) more stable MP, but with the caveat that LAN got removed from this version.  The constant support and existing features makes this a version to get even if you still have your old copy laying around."
"This game has long been a childhood favorite. It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC. I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite. For those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one. A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community."
"I thought I was over my AOE addiction back when MSN zone shut down. I managed to go outside and make some friends. I even got a girlfriend and a job. Life was good until a colleguage told me to check out the black friday steam sale. I noticed AOE HD listed with 70% off and immediately started having flash backs of the game from back in 2000.  I have to say the game hasn't changed from what I remember and once I got the hang of the keys I was playing like a pro again. In the first few months there were crashing issues in the lobbies but these have been fixed recently. I now love playing it just as much as I used to and spend most nights in deathmatch games.  The population limit increase it the only feature i've noticed to really improves the game from the original...apart from that its the same, so probably overpriced for a 15 year old game. Reasonable if you pick it up in a steam sale.  Unfortunately my girlfriend got sick of the sound of camels moaning while she tries to watch towie so our relationship took a bad turn...my boss has also noticed my work productivity has decreased because I spend too much time sitting in deathmatch lobbies when i'm supposed to be working...he said if things don't improve I will be fired.  I think I could enjoy this game more if I was single and unemployed but at the moment it's causing too many problems :(  "
  Better than Clash of Clans  
When i play this game i imagine myself killing vast armies of EA representatives
you can sink ships by converting them to christianity 10/10 just like i remember it
 Will a remake from Age Of Empires II: Age of Kings fit into the expecation from the gamers? Lets find it out!
I was suspended from school for installing this game on all of it's computers.  Would definitely get suspended again; 11/10
This HD version is doing the same thing the original release did.  Ruining my life.
10 war elephants could fit on a boat but 11 archers couldn't. gg
Born too early to conquer the galaxy. Born too late to discover the world. Born just in time... ...to play Age of Empires.
"Age of Empires II, known in the professional world as Human Resource Management Simulator 99’, is the premier HR Management Simulator. After 16 years, it still stands in a league of its own. Simple to use, this software is utilized by the likes of Fortune 500 companies and top tier business schools for training and retaining skills. Furthermore, it doubles as an entertaining and interactive platform for learning about the Middle Ages.  HRM Simulator 99’ takes place in a historical period running from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the dawn of the Colonial Age. You will be placed in the role of a medieval leader seeking to build your kingdom and defeat your opponents. In order to win, however, you will need to micromanage your human resources with the utmost efficiency and effectiveness.   Central to your efforts is the villager. Villagers are the ideal worker. They can work for indefinite periods of time while earning nothing and aptly work several different jobs throughout your kingdom. They can handle everything from construction to fishing to sapping enemy buildings. Your villagers are also loyal to you beyond question; they will even gather berries while wolves are mauling them to death.  Once you have established a perfectly efficient economy using the principles of operations management, you will have to shift your attention to raising an army and defeating your enemies. As a human resources manager at Proctor &amp; Gamble put it, “HRM Simulator 99’s army management is good preparation for some of the most daunting tasks that a new manager may face in the real world”. While managing your army in battle, you will also still need to pay attention to your economy, keeping your villagers on task and away from becoming useless, idle drones.    Campaigns (Spoilers?):    Play as Mel Gibson and beat up the army of a dude named Edward Longshanks who, despite his last name, cannot shank anything for long.   Play as a teenage chick, summon Shelby Cobras for horny Frenchmen so that they can shoot up snotty Britons.   Play as a legendary ISIS commander and defeat NATO forces in Israel.   Play as Genghis Khan, travel the world and break down the Great Wall of China with an extraordinarily fast &amp; furious monkey.   Play as der Fuhrer, subdue domestic opposition, invade Poland and convince Italy to side with you. Then drown in a river and get buried in a pickle barrel.   Play as Attila the Hun, beat up everyone and steal their everything.   Play as Good Guy Greg, save your king’s life even after he screws you over and imprisons your family.   Play as Cuauhtémoc, repulse the Spanish invasion of Tenochtitlan with the help of God-given Hun Tarkans and Korean Turtle Ships. Witness the evolution of Cuauhtémoc from a loyal, concerned jaguar warrior into a tenacious resistance leader and then finally into the last Emperor of the Aztecs. Then play Age of Empires III and see him finally become a psychotic blood fetishist fighting wars in oddball locales all across Asia and the Americas.   If you successfully complete these campaigns with flying colors and prevail over your colleagues in online skirmishes, you will be ripe to become the CEO of one of the largest corporations in the world!   500/500  Preferred by all large-cap corporations listed on the S&amp;P 500. In other words, buy this game if you want to invest in the American economy!"
Apparently stone walls catch fire.
"To sum it up simply,   You can spend 5 hours playing a game, thinking that you've been playing for only 30 minutes.   10/10"
I love this game. More than my life.
"Played this to death as a kid and it is exactly how I remember it.  AoE2 is the quintessential medieval base builder that has you conquering your opponents through four 'Ages', with progressively stronger and better units. Best part was they released an expansion after more than a decade because this game has such a cult following.  The game has you gather resources, build structures, amass units and go trapsing over maps of all kinds. These range from tiny islands to pretty decent sized representations of European climates that have you seek out and destroy your enemies or win by several other not-so-total conquest game types. The new expansion allows those maps to be massive and adds even more civilizations to play with, making the total 23. These civilizations span from all corners of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. All units have voice clips in their native languages to help with the feel of every faction being truly different in addition to visually unique buildings and units depending on the cultural locale of your civilization.  With its migration to Steam AoE now has great multiplayer support, achievements, and Steam Workshop capabilities that will allow the sharing of user-created content to be spread much easier than having to download things like scenario maps from a third-party webpage over dial-up as I did back in the day.  If you played this game in the past, it is well worth picking up again if nothing more than for nostalgia goggle syndrome because you know just how fun this was. If you somehow missed the boat in the past and are a fan of games like this there is literally no reason you should not own this game. It has been improved and will more than likely be considered one of the fine wines of gaming; Better with age and enjoyed even more with friends."
"Age of Empires II HD is a classic strategy game and a must-have for both old and new fans of the RTS genre. Although, the original game was realised in 1999 it managed to stand the test of time due to its unique art style.   The gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. As you begin in the Dark Ages and try to advance your civilisation to the Imperial Age. A good building order is important for maintaining an optimal economy to support your war machine. It does not feature unique abilities that units can utilise and therefore it does not require the extensive micro-management as seen in games such as Starcraft II and Warcraft III. Actually, the introduction movie of the game says it all as two kings play a game of chess, the pieces representing units in the game. This is how Age of Empires feels, a real time chess game where every move matters and momentum is key.   As an added bonus the soundtrack of the game is amazing, although I do miss the original menu music. However, thanks to the support of the Steam Workshop, there is a mod to fix that (and many other things). Overall, the HD version is what it says: an update of the already impeccable original game with better textures and HD resolution support."
"If you know what Age of Empires 2 is: get it. The HD version is a delight and they also added multiplayer support and decently-priced DLC. The remake is among the best i’ve played.  If you don’t know what AoE2 is, you are in for a sweet treat, a blast from the past, a game of… much fame? Alright I’ll stop.  AoE2 is a RTS in which you play one of many olden civilizations, starting in the Dark Ages, and progress all the way to the Imperial Age, all while expanding, building an army, creating defences, researching military/industrial/agricultural improvements, leading your forces to battle, creating trade routes, protecting wonders, finding relics, gathering all seven Dragon Balls et cetera et cetera.  The “to do” list might intimidate new players, but AoE2 plays as smooth as butter, with easy controls and button layouts. After a few sessions and looking up a guide, you too will have a strong starting economy and empire in 15 minutes during skirmishes (campaign can be a different beast altogether).  The economy is based on 5 resources: food, wood, stone, gold and population (from houses). There are multiple ways to get each resource, albeit stone and wood trading is a bit difficult with the AI since this isn’t really a game about diplomacy. Gold however can be taken from “trading” easily among two of your marketplace buildings: the further they are, the more you get.  Be prepared to spew out villagers left and right and grab any rock and log you can get, since you will need them to build an army. Besides the regular soldiers, each civ has it’s own perks and a castle with a unique soldier. Some have restrictions to certain troops or upgrades, making sure each one feels and plays slightly different.  All of these can be inspected neatly in the Tech Tree, available both in and out of game. You will also find an encyclopaedia about medieval battles, units, buildings, kingdoms; all sorts of neat things that old farts like myself wish were still around in modern games. It’s also worth mentioning that AoE2 HD, without any DLC, has 9 historical campaigns that are both entertaining, educational and, at times, hard as nails.  If you like “easy to learn difficult to master” RTS games, absolutely get it."
Make your childhood great again!
"This game is one of those that turned me into a PC gamer, its the godfather of all RTS, could play it for hours still and be amazed. The HD version added the option to play in 1080 and achievements, which is nice but its no excuse for charging $20 for a 15 years old game, besides there is still a lot of trouble with the lag MS is not fixing.  My score 9.5/10"
+ Updated versions of classics 'The Age of Kings' and 'The Conquerors' to run on modern systems + Steam Workshop support with good compatibility for legacy mods + Same classic gameplay with improvements still being made  +/- Multiplayer is easy to set up but one person lagging still slows the game for everyone
"Age of Empires II HD is a real-time strategy from Microsoft Studios. It is a perfected version of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.  All gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.  The graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.  Well, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this.  Rating 9/10"
" A rabbi, a bishop, and an Age of Empires priest walk into a tavern. They were having a conversation about who’s religion is better.  “Judaism is the one true path!” said the rabbi. “The people should be Christian!” said the bishop. “Wololo” said the Age of Empires priest.  Both agreed Age of Empires priest had the best religion. "
I hate this game! Wololo I love this game!
"This is the exact same game you played 10 years ago, would you want it any other way?  10/10"
Great game  Not convinced?  Wololo  Now you are
"Age of Empires 2 is in my opinion the best game ever made. It's a timeless classic that is still just as enjoyable today as the day it came out. In my opinion it is the best RTS game of all time and for that to still be true 10 years later, it is certianly worth full price.  However, this is the HD version so it is slightly different. Graphics are practically the same - which is ok for such a timeless game. However it doesn't quite live up to it's HD title. However, I came back for the game - not for anything new.  This HD version HDifys the gameplay rather than the graphics. It adds a new map size and increases the highest pop cap to 500 - allowing for much better games if your PC can handle it. The new map size hurts the PC more than the pop cap though and I've played 500 pop games on a laptop on the old standard map size. I don't recommend doing that with more than one player though. Nonetheless, huge armies are very fun to play with and add that little thing that we probably would've modded in. However - if this is what sold you then make sure you have a decent PC for it because it gets unbearably laggy on certian systems.  Another update is the new AI which they patched in at some point. As a man who prefers to do single player, this new AI added a proper challenge to the old game when I played all the time during my childhood. I used to be able to take on 6 other AIs on the hardest difficulty all on the same team. Now I struggle against them on equal footing. However, you do have the option of playing against the original AI if you want. Even a mix if you really want. The only problem I've found with it is that it will focus on water whenever there's a significant amount of water on the map. This can be good at times but when they attempt a galley rush on highland and you walk right around them it's limitations can be quite apparent.  One big flaw is it's multiplayer. They've removed the LAN function for some reason. Despite this I still play this at LAN parties but we play through the online mode. A little bit annoying. Another thing is the lag. There's a noticable lag between when you click somthing and when it notices. This did cause problems but they are working on patching these problems out. The lag still exists but I'm no longer having the problem of me putting many houses in a line and it registering the house I accidently placed rather than the ones I wanted. However, I have played an entire game which was full of unbearable lag. However, it has multiplayer (the original's doesn't work anymore) and it actually lets you try the new civillisations from the expansion packs in it.  Overall, this is still the Age of Empires 2 that I loved all my life. It didn't need updating but they gave it a go and basically refreshed the experience a bit by letting me play on larger maps and with larger populations. Still the same game and therefor worth full price in my opinion. I'd personally say that the fact that the game is still being updated and you've got expansion packs if you want more, it's somthing you should get. Even if you've never played it you should try this game as it is the best game of all time in my opinion."
Look at the hours ive played and tell me i am not obsesed with this game.
"When I was just 8 years old, I began to play this game with my father, and now I am 21 years old. I used to used the pirated software,but now I decide to support original As the milestone of the Real-Time Strategy, you should buy it to play or just collect it ,it is well worth it. 当我还是个8岁小孩的时候，我和我爸一起玩的这个游戏，现在我已经21岁了 我原来一直使用盗版软件，但现在我决定支持正版 作为RTS游戏的里程碑，他值得你去玩或者仅仅是收藏，他值得这么做"
Terrible game.  **wololo**  Incredible game.

"A game that made part of my childhood, one of the best RTS I ever played, brought back in its full glory with HD graphics. It's a must have on your library!"
Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while and don't have much to play now days.   This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game.   You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over.   All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!
  Age of Empires II HD
"A old classic game that is always fun to play. it may be old and the graphics might not look the nicest, but if you can play 3 hours straight without noticing how much time has gone by, I can sure tell you it is a good game."
Father of strategy games.
"The Little Mod That Could. A Franchise Refurbished, Yet a Missed Opportunity.  The age of empires series is one of fame. After 13 years it can still be purchased (along with its expansion, The Conquerors) at Wal-Mart and Office Depot. This 'new' title is an attempt at sprucing up one of the most beloved games of the franchise. It is amazingly rare to see an old property being brought back to life and updated, especially by a parent company that is only looking forward to the next big buck, and are willing to drop any title not making 500% profit (AOE Online was scrapped after a year in the wild, and much needed updates to many games still hang in limbo at EA). Only the bigwigs know what made them bring this one back, but we are glad to see some dust wiped off of our past every once in a while. Developer 'Hidden Path' was contracted to shine up the series fav and bring it into the new age of gaming, they fixed important things and they didn't fiddle around where it wasn't needed, but they missed a couple of points that would have made it into a new age RTS diamond.  First of all, I must thank hidden path for finally raising the unit cap, but why only 500? While it is a good 2.5x higher than before, our machines are 250x more powerful than the Pentium II 200mhz it was originally designed for. I can only guess that much of the core engine remains as it was, and 500 was the highest they could go without breaking it. Even though the cap has been raised, you can still only select 20 units at a time. Was it something that was overlooked? not likely. Here is another notch in the theory of a stretched engine. They just couldn't do more without overhauling the back end.  While we are on the graphics, The reason it has HD in the title is the ability to hit 1920x1080, (and beyond for multi monitor rigs) whereas the original topped out at 1024x768. I agree with the general consensus in that the overhauled building and unit models are amazing, but once again the elderly engine comes through showing us no shadows, no zoom, and no visual effect updates. These are an almost standard feature of today's even bargain bin games that they missed completely. Does it detract from gameplay? Not really. Could they have spent a little more time bringing the graphics engine into this decade without effecting gameplay? yes.  The multiplayer. What can I say here? Game Zone worked (kinda) back in the day, but thankfully we have learned from those early days and have integrated the game wholly into Steam's online network with only a few launch bugs and some early lag issues (to be continued). What this means is a front row ticket to a beautifully seamless multiplayer before-game matching experience, but completely removes the LAN option that, like me, so many young geeks had permanently set up in their basements just for this. Inclusion with the Workshop will make mod and map finding a breeze, and I believe the good outweighs the bad here, but somehow there is still a bad taste somewhere in my mind from losing our offline multiplayer. (single play is still allowed offline).  The music score has been redone, but I can still pound the number keys for WOLOLOOO and 'I Need Wood'. No complaints there.  All-in-all it was well worth the money, and it is the authentic Age Of Kings/Conquerors experience, but the lack of improvements to the gameplay, and the surface improvement to the graphics makes this game feel more like a decent mod than a blockbuster.  (For further fiddling- the mod 'Forgotten Empires' does everything this HD remake does, plus adds hours of single player campaigns, and a good dozen fixes)"
"I remember playing this as a kid, before I got into games like Counter-Strike. Steam wasn't popular so this is what I would play.  The original game used to run on some low resolution, and was so obvious. The age of the title had something to do with it ;)  But as it was, it didn't really matter to me. I would love being able to sit down and do what I wanted to do. I didn't have to kill everyone off, I could get the 'artifacts' or build a wonder to win. Even the Regiside (kill the enemy king(s)) gamemode is a good gamemode.  Multiplayer isn't as good but it's nice to be able to play with friends again. With all RTS titles, it's whoever can rush the enemy the fastest. That's what bugs me about the multiplayer. If you can get over that, there's no major outstanding issues. ELO ranking has been added, but don't base your skill off of it.  Even though it may look like it supports old machines, there was a requirement for some new shader/texture thanks to the water. Not sure if it really is the water, but you need a dedicated card of some sort. Old Intel GMA graphics don't support it. So any reasonable card such as a GT 8600 or GT 9800 would make a great choice here.  7/10"
This is the game i think about when i think about my childhood...
"First of all, thanks to my friend Augo, who gifted me this game.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  This game is, truly, a masterpiece. If you liked Starcraft, you will love this game. What's the objective of this game? Winning. How? Well, make an empire. Defeat other players. Be the best one.  GRAPHICS:  Well, what can you expect from a 99s game? Nothing but trash (compared to new AAA games), right? Well, this remake has made the graphics lovely. They changed a little bit and now, you can play the game at 1080p.  GAMEPLAY:  This is the very best thing of the game. The gameplay is exciting, fast, and makes you want to keep on playing. I just have 5 hours, but Augo gifted me this game 1 day ago (31/10/16).  STORY:  This game has a few campaigns to complete. Since I started playing on normal singleplayer, the tutorial itself it's a campaign about how the Scottish rebeled against Edward Longshanks.  SOUND:  This game has a very beautiful soundtrack, but it's quiet repetitive after hearing it everytime.  OTHERS:  This is a very good example of remake. The bad thing is that the new AI is very strong. They can make a great empire in a matter of minutes. Very replayable game. It has trading cards, Steam Workshop, map editor and even multiplayer. This is, definitely, a classic.   Why are you reading this? GO BUY IT! :D  ---------------------------------------------------------------  If you REALLY readed all of my review, thanks so much. This is my first serious review, as I mostly do joke reviews with memes and jokes.  Thank you for reading!! Hope this was helpful."
My crops can grow in thick snow as my morbidly obese King outruns horsemen and arrows alike. 10/10 would play again.
"My friend decided once that we would play a round of 2v4 (us vs four AI opponents) Age of Empires II, but limiting ourselves to our unique units and monks.  Victory by assimilation  10/10 would Wololo the entire world again"
"One of, if not 'THE' best, Real time Strategy game of all time! I do have very fond feelings for Age of Empires: Gold, as well as Rise of Nations, but AoE II takes the biscuit and slam dunks it from a bungee jump! (yes that is actually a world record) All the fun of building, Battle and tactics, with 'mostly' correct history and a tonne of community created content and scenarios to boot :) I love the diversity of the units, buildings and nations, especially with the inclusion of the new DLC. Who doesn't want to lead an army of 150 samurai?! or throwing 75 petards into an enemys base from behind, erradicating everything in their path? Would always recommend to anyone, even non RTS fans. 10/10"

"So, what can I say?  It's Age of Empires II, the best game of the series. It's still as addicting and fun as it has always been.  New support for higher resolutions, though it doesn't really look better to me, but it does improve the overall view. Some new civilizations also made it to the game (DLC).  Overall the gameplay is pretty much the same as the original, didn't notice any major improvements, but this game didn't need any to begin with.  Price might seem high, but on a sale, this definitely makes for a decent purchase."
"Age of Empires II: Age of Kings was originally released in 1999, and it is one of the most influential titles in one of real-time strategy’s most celebrated franchises. It holds a special place within gaming history as a solid, meat-and-potatoes RTS generously drizzled with rich historical gravy.  Age of Empires II: HD’s main changes are updates to the graphics engine, allowing the game to be compatible with modern machines. The game has been overhauled to allow players to take advantage of HD displays and multiple monitors. But one of the strongest elements of the re-release is the score, which has been lovingly remixed. The music now evokes a more sophisticated mood than it did previously, and it’s something that adds greatly to the feel of the game.  This edition of Age of Empires II includes The Conquerors expansion, so fans wanting to replay the campaigns will find hours of familiar scenarios. These haven’t aged particularly well; the scripting system compares poorly with other titles, particularly Blizzard’s Warcraft III and StarCraft II. There are many instances of breaking the fourth wall, where victory and activation conditions are very obviously scripted rather than fitting seamlessly into gameplay.  The new textures added to water, fire, and earth add a nice new look to the terrain. It’s subtle, but the overall impression is refined and almost painterly. The terrain itself has been one of the biggest changes, with a mesh system now used to give a more even natural landscape. Also gone are the 256 colour UI elements, and the icons have been updated to a more rustic feel to go with the softer 32-bit colour scheme.  The only significant change made at all to gameplay is the raising of the maximum population cap to 500. This is a lost opportunity to fix the kinds of problems that even diehard fans consider simple annoyances. The ability to select more than 20 units would have been a worthy addition, and is simply a control flaw rather than a balance or creative issue. Running at 1920x1080 allows for a huge number of units on one screen, which still need to be divided into small divisions to command in battle.  The most positive change – and one that will justify the price tag for most players – is multiplayer. Although alternative matchmaking services have done much to keep interest in the online game alive over the years since the demise of Microsoft’s clunky Gaming Zone, Steam integration puts players back onto a universal ladder system. The platform’s social features and existing framework also mean players can come to the game with their own networks firmly in place.  So for better or worse, Steam has come along and is now selling a game it’s quite possible many gamers already own in some form or other. The changes are subtle, but well-intentioned and admirably executed. Multiplayer is excellent. Those who loved Age of Empires II should happily indulge in some nostalgia with this HD facelift. Anyone new to the game will be frustrated by the lack of modern control systems and responsive hot keys.    Recommended "
How could I not recommend this game! I've spent almost 3 years making videos about it :P

"Instead of writing a review, let me tell you a story. I recently had an online 3v3 match where I had to fight the Japanese, British, and the Spanish. Early on, my friend got attacked by the Spanish which left his empire severely crippled. He sent some villagers to settle next to my empire so we could attack together. Around the beginning of the second hour, we kept getting attacked by the Japanese, so we assembled large armies to push through. Soon enough, my navy and our armies destroyed the Japanese. We both settled in the area because the Japanese left a lot of resources around. Resources were scarce around midgame, so we set up small strike forces to chip away at the British empire. Soon enough, we lead an ambush on the British, attacking their buildings and razing their farmlands. We killed their army and destroyed their most important buildings, eventually causing them to surrender. Our last enemy were the Spanish. Led by Queen Isabella, she had armies of monks and conquistadors. We kept getting our asses destroyed by her forces, almost leading us to surrender. She had controlled most of the land, which would prove to be a challenge to us. It took us about 2 hours to destroy her navy and kill her conquistadors and monks. Soon enough, she surrendered, as we just toppled the largest empire on the continent and brought it to its knees. We won the match when the clock struck 5 hours. God I love this game."
"I remember back in 2000, 2001 ish. I was about 6,7 years old and I remember sitting on my father's lap. I remember those summers, long and humid and hot. My father would be playing Age of Empires the Conquerors. It was the first game I really got into, I remember back in early 2000s all the internet cafes in China would be filled with people playing AOE, warcraft, starcraft, and red alert. AOE was the game everyone plays. I remember one time I played against my father when he had to stay at work late and I just got to feudal age and he put a freaking castle in front of my TC. I was crying and I was so sad. Those were the days. And Now I cant tell you how excited I am to get back into it. Classics never die."
"Tell a male Saracen villager to go pick berries. He sounds absolutely insulted and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you would dare make him go pick some motherf*ckin berries. Srs, he's really insulted.   I also enjoy repeating what the villagers and units say when you click on them/tell them to do something. Then I try and figure out how it's spelled if it was English."
I converted a trebuchet to my side.  10/10 would wololo again
"Opening first impression  WARNING PRETTY LONG REVIEW:  well this is my first ever real review and i have alot to say about this game first i want to say I deffiently have had some experince from this game as you can see i have played over 1000+ hours and am still playing this game today. Now age of empires is not a bad game but it is deffiently not for everyone. Now lets dive into this review here.  Single player campaign  Say you dont have internet or maybe you just dont want to play online well there is a variety of levels in the single player campaign for you to enjoy from the french all the way to the aztecs the campaign is packed with hours of fun filled levels each having there own story its also a good place to start if you are new to the game its slow paced and gives you a taste of what the game is like and how it will handle  artificial intelligence  although they did update this to make it feel more like your verusing an online player it ovbiously still lacks what online players have wich is diffrent strategys and diffrent skill levels the AI in this game isnt the best and is flawed but i guess you have to make do with what you have. atleast i can say its better practice then the old AI that wouldint even get the last blacksmith upgrades in the imperial age making them a joke and very easyy to deal with. so i say if your going to do any sort of deathmatch or random map or scenario for the matter you should stick to playing with real people.  Scenario Editor  This is my personal favorite of the game are you tired of online dont feel like playing aginst the crappy AI then why not make your own adventure or your own story in the scenario editor. i have had hours of countless fun making simple levels that i enjoy by myself to complex levels that are still in development this is deffiently one of the best features on Age Of Empires 2 just buying the game for this is worth it very user friendly, easy to usr and organized. the triggers take some practice to get use to but you will soon learn fast. the best part is that you can share your levels with the public and many other players can play them.  multiplayer  This is where the main core of the problem is for the game multiplayer is very unstable very laggy and the community isnt to nice but its not the worst you still will find alot of decent player but ocassionaly run into the ones that always try to out do everyone or put other down. if you have much patience then you may be able to handle the lag but some game lag can just be unbarable. Dont even get me started on the dysync if there on accedent or on purpose they really know how to ♥♥♥♥ you off, The worst type is the player that does it intentionally because he or she is a sore loser or doesint want to lose ELO(the points that show your ranking in the game.  Civalizations  The game age of empires has a vast amount of civilizations to chose from in the game this maxumizes gameplay allowing you to tamper and play around with diffrent strategys for diffrent empires. maybe you like the ranged gunpowder of the turks or the close quarters combat of the aztecs. or maybe you like to ride the fearsome paladins of the franks into battle who knows there are many diffrent strats and builds you can try.  Age Of Empires 2 Overall  Age of empires is a very fun game if you can get past the bad multiplayer lag although occasionally you come across some good lobbies that wont lag near as bad. even without multiplayer or if your preffer to play offline this game offers so much content that it takes a very long time to get bored if you chose to spend your money on the game even with its flawess i would say you would be makking a wise choice for 20 dollars i dont think you can go wrong.

"Exactly the same game from 1999, except everything  works  and Conqueror's is free. The year is 2014, and  you  were there."
"Age of Empires II HD, well HD? Not really. That doesn't change the fact that it's still a pretty good stragety game.  I personally love the unique units you can train in castles, for instance when you play as the Spanish you can train a unit called the Conquistador in your castle, a unit wich only you (while playing as Spain) can create.  The maps are quite big, so enough space for large battlefields.  While the naval battles aren't bad either, I personally love the land battles between two different infantry units.  The original 18 civilizations are still in the game, but a DLC has been added: The Forgotten (empires) This DLC ads 5 new civilizations, including the Italians and the Inca's. All civilizations have got their very own unique unit, and building style. An awesome new campaign has been added aswell. Here are a few short descriptions about the different campaign scenario's:  1. Alaric I:  The trauma of the Hun invasion in the 4th century has shaped Alaric, the fearsome warrior king of the Goths. But can the beloved king secure a new homeland for his people in the territory of the collapsing Roman Empire?  2. Sforza:  Always hungry for glory and wealth, Sforza wanders around 15th century Italy, offering his services to the highest bidder. Will he pick the right battles or make the wrong enemy? Take the fate of the young mercenary captain in your hands.  3. Bari:  400 years after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Italy is still up for grabs. Relive the tale of the port city Bari from the point of view of a Byzantine family, rising from the common soldiery to the nobility. Beware, for not only Bari is at stake, but also control of Southern Italy.  4. Dracula:  History forged an incredible legend around the man who ruled Wallachia in the mid-15th century. Holding his ground against the vast armies of the expanding Ottoman Empire, his cruel tactics made him the most feared man in all of Eastern Europe. Will his thirst for blood and the loyalty of his soldiers hold the Turks back for good?  Sounds good doesn't it? Well it is.   The €18,99 you pay for a game wich should be HD but the only thing HD in the game is the water, might be a bit much. But it's defenitly worth it."
I miss my  wololo  guys from part 1
"There is just too much to say about how amazing this game is so I will be brief. My dad first got this game for me when I was 5 years old, and it was my childhood. A long time passed and Age of Empires seemed to die down... However when the HD Edition was released I cannot describe how happy I was. Even if you have never heard of this game you are in for a big treat, because this is the best strategy game of all time."
 Age of Empires 2: HD Edition is not for everyone!
Destroyed the Persian Empire with a horde of Shelby Cobras. 10/10
Got beaten in multiplayer by a Spaniard who only used Missionaries. 8/10 Would convert to Christianity again.
I was boring so i played against a bot. That bot had a full army of monks. I had a full army of elephants. 10/10 would destroy my base with my units again.
"Only a few weekend chores, a Packard Bell, buttery crumpets and AoEII. I never had it so good as a kid. A true trip down memory lane makes makes it worth it's full price alone and is a steal at sale price. As an '80's kid this series had become the premier RTS for me- Total Annihilation aside- and despite it's now aged look, abundance of micro managment and somewhat limited unit roster it'll keep you hooked game after game especially for returning fans. Those who are new to the older titles well it'll be an education. But one you'll ultimately enjoy."
"It's classic and it must be known. Literally. Of course, dinosaurs were playing this game when they were young, but it's still brilliant. It's a grandfather of all modern RTS. Yes, it has awful graphics according to nowadays, but it still looks pretty and nice. Campaigns are elegant both in terms of diversity, both in terms of historical accuracy. The only disadvantage of the game is a lack of scale: the great Barbossa's army, which has to go in crusade by feet, because there's no fleet in Europe, that can hold it, costs only 75 points of population."
"MARCO POLO LUMBERJACK CHEESE STEAK JIMMY'S ROBIN HOOD ROCK ON HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON,HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON  Good, now I'm ready to play.  10/10. Would cheat again."
This game never gets old. Been playing since 2002.  wololo~~~
One of my favorite memories is playing this game back in the day with my Brother and some of my cousins. This game helped me develop my ability to strategize and think quickly as a kid.  I gotta say I hoped the game would have been fixed up a little more when I saw it on Steam and got ahold of a copy in a gift trade but I know they have AOEIII and things and I do love how it just takes me back to being a kid who played when it came out. I actually have my old box copy with manual and the expansion disc too.  This is a great game to LAN with friends or just play solo while bored and needing to kill time.  It may not be enjoyed as much by millennials or people who want all the new graphics and such but any 80's or 90's kids that grew up on it or parents and others who played will definitely have a blast from the past.
"First of all, I played this game when i was a little kid and oh man, all the memories and the feeling are back. The community is awesome, if you are a competitive player you will find you can find your place here, though casual players can enjoy the game too.  But I'm writing this review to encourage people who never played this brilliat RTS game, to try it out. It has a reason why this game isn't dead yet, although it's 17 years old. It's hard to start a game as a new player, but if you invest some time in it, there will be no problem at all."
It's better than AOE3. One of the best strategy game i've ever seen.
"Age of empires 2 HD ~ Dont think just buy. This game is one of the best Real-Time-Stratergy games i have ever played, You will never get bored, The community is great, The game is amazingly fun, The graphics is beautiful(compared to its old counterpart) A classic, beautiful game that you must play, Dont think just buy."
"This was one of my childhood games and it has aged really well. The gameplay is really addictive and it is so satisfing to watch your civilization grow and dominate everyone else. Playing with other people is a lot of fun and the game compares your skill level to everyone else's so you always know whether or not it will be a far match. That's not to say the game is perfect. As satisfying as the game is when your winning, it's really depressing when your losing; all that hard working building your civilization gone to waste. The learning curve is also really steep, especially if you're unfamiliar with this genre, and getting to the level of skill that most people have online is a bit of a chore. If you can go toe to toe with a 'hardest' level COM your probably ready to play with most of the average tier players. I'd also recommend a youtube channel called 'spirit of the law' if you want any advise on how to play the different civilizations. But it's a lot of fun to learn. I'd recommend it, even if you're not into strategy games. Come on in and play. More people need to. 10/10"
Taught me more about the dark ages and medieval empires than my history lessons.
"awesome blast from the past, nicely ported to modern systems, no stability issues or resolution issues. If you were a fan of AoE II back in the day i suggest getting this HD version"
"Having been one of my first PC games, no less than 15 years ago, Age of Empires II helped me refine my gaming tastes, giving me a penchant for strategy games (and for history, it's always been my favourite non-scientific subject at school).  It was a time when there were no cutting-edge hardware, nor eye-candy graphics, games were just meant to be fun. Even now, after 17 years from its initial release, Age of Empires II is still one of the most beloved RTS games of all times, and keeps getting useful DLCs which make it even better.  Too bad I can't add to Steam the hours I spent on the original, they would easily surpass one thousand, maybe even two..."
"AoE2 is a great game, it's become a family tradition to play it at christmas time, but the bad net code and conectivy issues made it take hours to trubleshoot and set up a mutliplayer game, the HD edition fixes all of those issues, makeing it basicly perfect."
"Played it as a child, still playing it today. Not sure if the game is that good or if I am still a child inside"
"* bugs which can ruin a gama * bad lobby system, maybe worst. * ranked system is awful  ....  i can say a lot of negative things.   But this is AOE 2, a legend.  Also; the best thing, there is no children playing this game.     "
I really love this game. After all this time i am still playing it with my friends. I think it is awesome that they still add DLC with new fractions. The workshop is pretty epic too. I won´t stop playing this game any time soon and why should i?  AOE IS EPIC!
FRIEND 1: yo wanna play some age of empires?

"Update 4: Props to the devs that are at least somewhat active in fixing this game.  Update 3: So age of empires World Domination was just announced. I almost feel like this is because of people attacking anything negative despite reviews showing objective problems. Most of the reviews on the front page of steam that are marked 'helpful' are hardly 'helpful' to people who played the original given the actual problems that haven't been listed and are completely useless to people who never played the game. When you have people who will attack anything negative someone says (I have yet to see a good argument against me saying this game isn't worth 20 dollars) then crap like this (AoE:WD) happens. MS now thinks that we are blind, thrashing, monsters that will buy anything with the Age logo on it who will blot out anyone who goes against it with just flaming (not constructive critcism, flaming). Now you may be the biggest age fanboy ever and you may try AoE:WD but you probably won't put money into it. Microsoft is clearly making (what looks like) a clash of clans ripoff to milk fans that will fail (at least in milking fans) and end up being a big waste of time to any fan of age of empires 2. I am not saying that 'fanboys did this' I am just not rulling out the possibility.  Update 2: Over a year, multiplayer is dead. Fanboys too busy humping this game to care. I can't believe some of the idoitic responses I have gotten from this. If you like and bought the game, why are you arguing with me? Why do you care? This game has flaws that make some aspects of the game OBJECTIVELY WORSE than the original. IE no lan, framerate issues, etc. I have reported on these flaws yet I am bashed for it. I have played hundreds of hours combined and yet you guys think you are at a better position to judge me when you can't even admit the objective faults of this game. MS now knows that they can charge whatever they want for each 'HD' edition they release and at whatever state they put it in and they know people will eat it up. Even if it's broken, the criticism will be drowned out by fanboys 'downvoting' (which is not how the system works, it goes by if the review was helpful, morons) every critical piece that comes out. You can still get the single player game with the mod for 10 dollars off amazon, with lan and fewer bugs. That is still a better value then what is here.   UPDATE: IT HAS ALMOST BEEN A FULL YEAR AND THERE ARE STILL D-SYNC ISSUES AND NO SERVERS (so people are still DCing and it's still laggy as ♥♥♥♥) FIX YOUR DAMN 20 DOLLAR PIECE OF GARBAGE.  -Actual Review  I'm sorry, what is with all these reviews with their positive ratings? You guys are okay with paying 20USD for a widescreen edition and paid dlc for a game that is more than a decade old AND that has had numerious bugs even 7 months later still have not been fixed? Like the online lag is still awful. 'But it's better than it was on launch' yes but it's still awful and at this rate I would advise just finding a copy of the original game and playing it with mods (like the Forgotten Empires, more on that soon) that run it on a modern system for the single player.  As for the DLC, I have not played it, but I have heard how it had lots of bug on launch and the patch to add it in fudged up the base game as well. Buyer beware the campaign doesn't even have voice acting although on their livestream they said they [maybe?] will look for voluneteers. It's nice that they are getting paid for it but instead of releasing it for 10 (which is really unreasonable might I add) why not make it free and give some of the money you (MS) made - from the upsurdly priced 20USD - and give it to the devs of forgotten empires.   Also, there are no benefits that come from the FE update, therefore, IF YOU BUY THE GAME BUT DON'T BUY FE, YOU NEED TO PLAY WITH OTHERS WHO DON'T HAVE FE OR WHO CHOSE TO NOT USE FE. THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SPLIT UP EVEN MORE, GREAT, THAT MEANS ONLINE IS EVEN MORE BUTCHERED.    Graphics and Performance it's not an HD edition, it's a widescreen edition with 2 graphics options (which weren't even on launch btw) as well as no screen resolution. 'But it's an old game, why do you need graphics options?' well that's because the game can run like crap online or offline on certain lower end machines. I run a gigabyte 7950 GPU with an intel 3770k I7 3.5 processor and the game runs like crap online, I HAVE PLAYED WITH 8 PEOPLE AND I GOT AN AVERAGE OF 15-25 FPS, THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT CAN RUN CRYSIS 3 AT ALMOST MAX AT 1080P 60FPS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO CHARGE ME 20 FOR A GAME THAT RUNS WORSE THAN A TRIPLE A GAME. Side note, when do you think people are gonna start saying 'But can it run AoE II HD online?   The poor optimization is shockingly bad but the game is basically unchanged. Remember those graphs you would look at after a game ended that would show certain stats? Yeah those are unchanged, they look really bad now as they haven't been updated with cleaner text or anything. I would have accepted that in early 2000s, not 2013 on an 'HD' edition.    Gameplay Yeah it's good. It's age of empires 2 what do you expect and from what I can tell, that's all people seem to care about and i'm assuming that is the only reason people are giving this game good reviews.   But guys, THIS IS NOT WORTH 20USD AND TO BE MARKETED AT AN HD EDITION WITH THIS CRAPPY PERFORMANCE AND BAD ONLINE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT HAS BEEN 7 MONTHS AND THERE ARE STILL MANY BUGS AND ONLINE IS STILL BROKEN.  I will be fair right now with the gameplay, the campaigns take time to beat and they are challenging. The gameplay had a satisfacation in the way it was made that - to me, for the longest time - beat other games, units wouldn't get stuck from time to time via collision on an object when you moved them, (Star Wars: Empire at War) units move when you tell them to without fail (company of heoes one had moments where they would just sit there) and they would respond quickly (age of empires 3, although many units behaved like that, many would move slow as balls). The core gameplay is enjoyable at least to a fan of the original but there are many outdated mechanics that I really don't have the time to go into, just think of starcraft 1 to starcraft 2 MECHANICALLY Ie unit binding, macros, replay systems, all that and how much of a leap back it feels going from starcraft 2 back to 1 after awhile of playing 2. The difference is very noticable.    Conclusion: On sale at like 5 bucks, if you don't want to bother digging up the original game and putting mods (which isn't very difficult) than yeah, maybe buy it. But at 20 USD with an expansion at 10 more? No, just no. For that price you can get Starcraft 2 for a few bucks more on Amazon. Age of Empires 2 was my favorite RTS of all time until I played Starcraft 2 (warcraft 3/frozone throne came in third) but now after playing Age 2 again, I like warcraft 3/FT better. WHICH YOU CAN BUY COMPLETE FOR 20 DOLLARS, IT IS A MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN THIS RIGHT NOW AND THE MULTIPLAYER (although it has its problems after recent patches) DOESN'T HAVE LAG ON EVERY GAME YOU TRY TO PLAY.  Yes, Age of Empires 2 is a good game but the HD edition is a disgrace. Don't praise this game just because it plays like the original. Don't charge 20USD for a re-release with bugs. Fix your game and make it look better and then I will reccommend it for almost anyone but at this point ONLY BUY IF IT'S ON SALE FOR 5USD OR LESS AND YOU ARE A FAN. Newcomers will get almost no value out of this instead of getting the original with mods.  If this was just an intended re-release for 5 bucks or 10 with workshop and multiplayer I would be singing a different tune."
"This HD remake has been riddled by various bugs ever since the release in April 2013, but at least multiplayer worked for the most part and I spent over 500 hrs. in it trough out the years and it was a hell of a ride. Well, that has changed since the release of the latest African Kingdoms expansion on November 5th, 2015 - since then multiplayer has been rendered unplayable. What is worse, the SkyBox Labs/Forgotten Empires crew ceased any communication regarding the problem shortly after. As early reviewer, I was assured by Cysion (Belgian member of a dev team) that repairing the broken multiplayer is high on to do list back on November 13, 2015, but nothing has happened since, except for the release of half-baked &amp; buggy expansion for Age of Mythology with the subtitle 'Tale of the Dragon' back in January 2016.  On reload, game does not seem to remember players/AI oponents involved, which can be clearly seen in the lobby, after reload, you cannot play a multiplayer game for more than a few secs before it just desynches. African Kingdoms was my very first and for sure the last preorder on Steam, sure, multiplayer-destroying update came to all AoE II owners, including those who did not bought the expansion, but this expansion symbolizes the beginning of the problem and the lack of commitment from the developers towards their own project which stands on multiplayer. They do not deserve any finnancial support unless they fix their mess. Until then AVOID!"
This game is a masterpiece for the Rts genre
"I played this alot as a kid and i love the new HD and DLCs, anyone who likes medieval RTS will enjoy this game 9/10"
"Hi everyone I am Rüştü Reçber,the old goalkeeper of Turkish national team.I used to play this game with my fellow team mates.I think it was year 2003 or 2004 it was one hell of a time back then... Even after Hard matches I played in I used to go home and say 'Semih age geliyomusun akşama' but now playing this game... feels good as it felt at release.I still got some of my friends playig it(Yes we Still do LAN matches in one of our houses).I recommend everyone to play this awsome game but ,don't just play it... learn it too and then teach others so that our legend would pass on from our generation to others  Thanks for reading all the way to bottom everyone here one of my nice saves,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-43eQ1fhfo "
"You throw arrows in the farm, and it starts to burn. 10/10"
"Don't worry about the low Metacritic- this is a solid remaster of one of the best strategy games ever made, with some nice improvements when it comes to multiplayer functionality and modding. Plus, getting new official content for a 17 year old non-MMO game? Mindblowing..."
"One of the greatest games from my childhood. I never realized how bad I am at it, i couldn't nailed it without using cheat codes well everyone did it before at least once hahahahahaha !!! It runs exactly as it should and brings all the memories flooding back. Excellent casual game for learning strategy."
"You know if you buy a 'remastered' (really) old game you'd expect that it's polished, all compability issues(apart from maybe the mac version) have been resolved, the preformance has been improved and maybe some content like maps or improved handling/pathfinding. None of this is the case for Aoe 2 HD, It has numberous compability issues with all systems, months after re-release, the preformance is actually down a bit, there is virtually no new stuff, mechanisms are still from the ninetees, Pathfinding is aswell and the increaced unit cap(not that great btw) only makes it worse, because 'retro is cool' they didn't even change the unitselection limit! now how ... not smart is that? 2,5 the unit limit but don't increace the number of selectable units?  While there are fairly many events, the support mainly boils down to 'have you tried turning it off and on again'.   Considering the Mo... Expansion, There are many great new aspects. But it's pretty obvious it's only a glorified mod. the comparison with AoC hurts it quite a bit. Not because of the civs or units but because of the Campaigns. The beautifully mapped and scripted maps but because of the shallow (and lacking)storytelling and the agitatingly narrow passageways through whom you have to maneuver 100 troops of different types combined with multi stage missions that are easily goofed. These missions are not particulary difficult, they are just annoying. I love lush and passable forests that don't just consist of blocks of trees and paths in between, but with this pathfinding and full armies it's just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to micro or getting your army through in the first place :/ . the lack of voiceovers is totally understandable for a mod but it's another hint that MS is minimizing it's work here and not really ok for an expansion, same goes for sketchy scribbleings on parchment before each mission. The great thing about the AoE2 campaigns was not the missions themselves, but the stroytelling. You sitting in the tavern with Henry the lion talking about Barbarossa, a Frankish PoW in Saladins Camp, badgering El cids Widdow on the streets, Cautemocs chronicles, Father armand and his Goth-Skull, those were FANTASTIC! - All this is lacking in 'the forgotten'.  Just take your old CD, install the mod (for free) and deactivate the explorer, and you have a game that is much stabler and cost you 'nothing' - this version only has one asset: Steam, yes steam is the asset here, that shows how low microsoft has sunken. With Steam you can easily get mods and maps, install it on machines without an optical drive and ... well you get acchievements, if you're into that stuff. I just got it because I'm currently working with just a small laptop(no optical drive). I still think that 25 liters of cheap beer would have been preferable."
still the best game ever made if you dont like it gtfo
"If you were like me as a kid, you didn't even OWN the game! You just played the demo and OVER played it, drained the map of everything and just slaughtered EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!"
Easily one of the greatest games of all time
"a timeless masterpiece.  i dont remember how many hours ive played when the original age of empires 2 came out, but it was A LOT.  seeing it on steam, after all this years, magnificent! the textures improved just a tiny bit in the HD version, but thats not what the game is about.  gameplay, scenarios and gametypes are what make age of empires so great.  being able to create content in steam workshop, ( in the dlc!) to stream your games, to spectate other peoples games and steam achievements are a nice addition to the original game.   sure, you could get it as retail for a lower price, but if you are like me, happy about new great games in your shiny steam library, this game is a must have!"
This game is abso-  *wololooo*  -lutely wonderful
"Exactly one of the first PC games I've played in my life. It's been 14 years and I'm 21 now, I can't even remember how many PCs I've used up, yet this game still gets me sitting along for a few hours and brings me joy. LONG LIVE, AOE!"
"If this game were a potato, it would be a good potato."
"This game is the King of RTS. I have not played it much since getting it on steam but that is because I have hundreds of hours logged on the game outside of steam. If you love history and RTS this is the game for you. Far superior to Age of Empires 1 or 3. While the game may look a little dated, Don't let that fool you, the mechanics are still top of the line."
"Warning: If you buy this game with a couple friends, you cant play an entire summer away  If you own a computer then buy this game. It's that simple. You need this game if you own a computer"
Best game of my childhood.
This game is my true love &lt;3  10/10
I found this HD version of AOE II kept with the roots that all the fans of this clasic game were looking for while opening it to a whole new generation of games through brushed graphics and improved conectivity in game via steam. 10/10 will play frequently
"What is there to say about this game?   I've played this to death in my childhood, countless hours playing just one more skirmish. It really is a true classic. The multiplayer works splendidly, and it promises to keep on delivering even more countless hours of RTS fun. Just buy it, I guarantee you won't regret it."
WARNING: IF YOUR PC/LAPTOP RUNS A 4K DISPLAY THIS GAME WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY. THE HUD IS FAR TOO SMALL. OTHERWISE CRACKING GAME
One of the best great strategy games ever! I recommend it for all.
"I was in an interesting game today. Everyone was either a Turk or Byzantine, but we did have one Korean and a Teuton. The Korean died quickly. We laughed because one of the Byzantines was named Heinrich Himmler, the advisor for Hitler during WW2. My friend in the game was acting a lot like Hitler, killing every Turk, so you can imagine having Hitler's advisor was funny. I was one of the Turks, but my friend did not kill me.  Soon my empire grew and I started to kill off a Teuton who refused to give in to my demands. He was very weak and fled. I found him hiding in Heinrich's huge city, and it had turned out Heinrich agreed to protect him. Heinrich went to go eat and I decided I'll drop by and...hah...see how the Teuton was doing.  I bring 40 Heavy Camels, 50 Jannisaries, and 15 Petards. The 15 petards were used to blow up (as I screamed in chat 'ALLAH HU ACKBAR!') the little defense the Teuton had, effectively letting in my troops. The Teuton panicked and, again, tried to run away. I killed 23 of his villagers, but two got away. They got on a transport I presume, because next thing I knew, they were on a different land mass. I had trouble finding him, but eventually I did and got over there with 20 Cannon Galleons. By now, Heinrich had come back and noticed I was trying to kill the Teuton. He laughed but didn't choose a side.  Meanwhile, I began to build a wonder, which for a Turk like me is a Mosque. I said 'LET ISLAM REIGN!' as I finished the Mosque and put 15 Jannisaries on guard. My friend laughed before saying 'I hope you realize...I kill Muslims like you.' I laughed as well, thinking he was joking.  I got some pizza and decided to go eat some. I come back about 7 minutes later, being destroyed by my friend and his ally. Now it was my turn to panic. 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING *insert my friend's name here*?!' 'I'm stopping the spread of Islam! Succumb to Christianity!' 'OKAY OKAY I SURRENDER, CONSIDER ME CHRISTIAN!' 'You are no Christian until you tear your Mosque down!' 'But I...ugh, okay.' I selected the Mosque and clicked DELETE. It fell to rubble. 'Happy?' 'Yes.' Now we go back to the Teuton. He was hiding up north before, but in the short 7 minutes I was gone, he went back to Hein's city and Hein had built a wall around his town center. He called it the 'Teutonic Concentration Camp'. It was pretty funny. After a while we got bored and were going to select 'Allied Victory'. I still had a bone to pick with the Teuton, so I sent the remainder of my men after his camp, having to enemy Hein on the way there.  FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY KNEW I WOULD DO THIS. SERIOUSLY. EVERYONE IN THE GAME ENEMIED ME AND FOUGHT ME TO THE DEATH. THE TEUTON ACTUALLY WON WITH 1 TOWN CENTER, A VILLAGER, AND A FARM.  In the end I whispered to myself 'This must be how Israel feels'. 10/10 would be a failure of an Islamic empire again"
"Childhood memories, GG."
"First real PC game ever I fell in love with, I was in the 8th grade and used to walk to my grandfathers house to play this game everyday after school since I didn't have a PC yet. I was 12 years old, and am 28 now... still playing it from time to time. Damn, it is so badass to be a part of the gamer generation."
"I grew up on this game, playing this game brings back so many memories of summer's off from school waking up in the morning and making some fresh brewed blue berry flavored ice tea and sitting down in my step-dad's office chair and booting up his windows xp PC to spend the day while my parents were out working playing AOE II in single player and making awesome maps and mods (anyone else remember blue genie? Such great mods :p)   Also played online with my school friends a bunch although we had a sh$tty net connection it was still fun.  All these years later and this game has aged fairly well; that and the fact that I love playing it.  10/10 this game was one of my favs"
"This game did not have a negative review since December of 2013, until today. That is due to the recent expansion and patch update, but trust me, people. Don't give up on it. It is a 16 year old game that has been given new life, and a breath of fresh air due to the committed Forgotten Empires crew. My husband and I, as well as a group of friends, have had very many hours of fun on this game, and the hours on my account will continue to grow. I haven't gotten tired of this game, and it is the only game that I've ever played so many hours on in such a short time without losing interest.   The laughs, the tears, the anger, the happiness.... It's all worth it. You have 27 civilizations to choose from, and you can win in so many different ways, with strategies that aren't formed to a small 'box' like other games. There's really no right or wrong way to play, and that's what I love about it. Growing your village into an empire from your starting town center, few villagers, and a scout, only to lose it all in battle..... Such a grim ending, but it never ever gets tiring.   --  For those who think it is buggy and laggy, yes, it is, after the patch, but they are working nonstop to fix it, and I assure you it was NOT that way before.   Don't give up, it is worth it!"
great game even though it is so many years old. still plenty of people who play it
"I like to give this game a nickname which I like to called 'Mini Civilization'  I'm gonna be honest most of the time when I'm ingame it doesn't actually mean I'm playing, sometimes I play but most of the time I doing a bot only game or in other words a bot tournement, partically ResonanceBot 5-1c. Why you may ask cause I have a fascination for the AI :D.  So for every bot tournement I always have the same settings no matter what  - 8 bots - Black Forest - Hardest difficulty  - All Visible  - Standard Resources  - Random Civs   In my current bot tournement the civilizations they're playing as  - ResonanceBot 5-1c Blue, Aztecs - ResonanceBot 5-1c Red, Mongols - ResonanceBot 5-1c Green, Goths - ResonanceBot 5-1c Yellow, Britons - ResonanceBot 5-1c Light Blue, Saracens - ResonanceBot 5-1c Purple, Vikings ( Eliminated ) - ResonanceBot 5-1c Gray, Slavs  - ResonanceBot 5-1c Oranges, Koreans  So far playtime of the tournement 4h &amp; 12 minutes  It very addicted game indeed, honestly I believe it the best RTS game ever created follow by Mythology of course. In Aoe 2 the farms are quite annoying, how you had to constanty replenish the farms. The Perisans and Teutopns are my favourites to play as nothing more fun then building mass war elephants ( Strongest Cavalry or Teutonic Knights ( Strongest Infantry ) and roaming over your enemies. Don't care for online matches unless I playing with a friend or steam friend but other then that I pass.  Overall if you love RTS games I highly recommend you give this game a try, if you love Age of Empires 2 I also highly recommend you try out Age of Mythology same thing but with mythological units and god powers."
Dear God do I still play this.
"Way better off getting it off the net another way. While bringing mods together in a more streamlined, more conveinient way it's just not worthit considering the idiots thought that removing LAN play from THE ONE GAME that comes to mind of when you think of what to play at a LAN."
"Status: Denied The original game is very good, it's excellent, but the HD remake is horrible It got tons of issues with optimization, giving you low fps and the netcode was badly written, thus resulting in an unplayable multiplayer The reason it even appeared on steam was cause of the 'money hungry' Microsoft You see, there was already a mod, called Forgotten Empires, that allowed the HD resolution, and it was FREE In fact, the recent DLC ('Forgotten') for AoE2, was ripped of straight out of Forgotten Empires The thing that bugs me, is that Microsoft wasn't even involved in the making of the Forgotten Empires, they didn't invest money into it, yet here they are, selling it for 9.99$ Age of Empires 2 HD doesn't even have a retail version, it's digital only I wonder, whether they invested anything at all obviously the just ripped off The Forgotten Empires, as they are the holders of the IP, and used it for 'easy money'"
Quite bad at launch. Now it's fixed and worth it for both single- and multiplayer.
This game is more addictive than cocaine  I own three copies 10/10
"Remember the WOLOLO?  This was an awesome game back in the day. I remember spending hours upon hours after school coming home just to play this, and I'm glad there are still people working on it to this day. When I picked this up in 2013 on it's release date, I was convinced that there wouldn't have been any further updates other than the retextures and porting to Steam, etc. Glad it turned out that I was wrong, what with the continual release of DLCs for the game. That said, while it is definitely showing it's age - but with the DLCs, updates and the community still playing this game, it's kept it from going stale.  Developers are still consistently working on patch and bug fixes, and... hey, with the Steam Workshop you can do pretty much whatever you want in this game. Reworked mechanisms from the original are welcome to keep it up with recent RTS releases as well.   Now... I need to find friends to play this with ;-;"
"Is amazing how this game never gets old. This elder game was worth the effort of a full remasterisation into HD, the community is still active, competitive and it's creating a lot of content as maps, tournaments, tutorials and deep gaming analysis.  It's incredible complex and well balanced on its internal mechanics and even now is revealing hidden secrets that keep amazing us. Its aura, half vintage half fresh, its aesthetics and the peculiar mixture of economic development and military devastation created a masterpiece like few others strategic games.   It's virtually unique in its kind."
"Dave Chappelle created a classic that solidified his legacy as one of the greatest comedians of all time. His show is just as watchable and relavent today as it was on release, Age of Empires II is it's RTS equivalent in that sense."
"Yes, my hours says it all."
Probably one of the best game of all time!
"One of the best RTS of all time, it brings back good memories!"
Good old AoE action but now in widescreen resolutions. Of course I got the Real HD Edition texturepack from workshop to make it look even cooler. I haven't played strategygames that much since I'm more into fps games but this game truly has that something in it! I really enjoy playing this every now and then even tho I suck at it :D
"It was a good game, but the devs broke it somehow and havent patched it in months. No further communication on whats going on, check the forums.  Game currently lacks of basic functionality which used to work in the original, eg. being able to load a multiplayer saved game, multiplayer desync issues and scenario triggers behaving incorrectly and randomly."
"Genre - Historical RTS  Great respect for the developers for bringing this game to the new world with added content and civilizations.  Despite my age, my first experience of AOE was the online version, which I really enjoyed and think was overlooked more than it should have been.  After loading this up I trialled the campaign and found it enjoyable if a bit slow. Most of the units are quite generic across the various Civs until you get to certain age within the game.  The game plays like most standard RTSs, where building the right things and managing your defences and resources is key.  I tried a skirmish on standard against the AI and got my butt handed to me. I put it on easiest and it was a walk in the park. So unfortunately the AI is a bit ropey. Also you can't have different AI levels for more players, they all have to be the same. This is a bit restrictive if you are trying to setup an even game with friends.  Still it is worth the money and you should get loads of playability out of it. I personally think the original game was over rated, and the online version under rated, but I am one voice in the crowd there..."
"i think i've played about 6 matches in my 54 hours .. good times.  if you're bad at this game like i am, tell everyone that you're a peaceful nation and build up an army of petards in secret. then holler at your boys and let them know you're sending over a nice supply peace treaty or some crap and rip them apart with the strength of a thousand burning bodies.  you'll have nothing left, but neither will they."
Yes. Now remake AOE 1.
"This game is a musthave. It should be played by everyone atleast once if you are born before 2000.  Gather some friends, challenge ea in combat."
-how do you turn this on -furious the monkey boy -aegis -lumberjack / cheese steak jimmy's / robin hood / rock on - marco / polo - natural wonders - i love the monkey head - to smithereens - black death
This game was my childhood. I thank anyone who helped recreate this game. Thank you.
"Old School RTS in the category of Starcraft Brood War.  Great to play on the road, at home with friends, drinking a beer.  And it's history too. Wouldn't play it in History Class but you can try."
"The game that got me interested in strategy games. Amazing game that has aged well in my opinion. Workshop support is always a huge plus and keeps thingss interesting if you ever get bored (unlikely).  As much as I love it, I wouldn't pay £14.99 for it. Wait for a sale."
"one of the best strategy games of all time, and it just got better with new additions and better graphic and more armies ;)"
It was fun in 1999 it is fun in 2016
"Best RTS game ever made. I've probably played over 2000hrs of this game over my life and I'm still not bored of it. It has endless map variations and the map editor/creator is the best I’ve ever used in a game. Ever sense Zone went down it was sad that pvp was gone, but now online play is back which is amazing. If you like RTS at all, get this game. Also, all the dlc are worth it for this game. I’m hoping they keep making more civilizations."
This game suc...  Wololo   This is one of the best games I have ever played
"Been playing this game for 18 years, i dont need to add more :)"
It's AoE 2... what more can one say??
"If I knew this game had no LAN support, I would not have bought it. (Spanish Translation Below) Si sabia que no tendría soporte LAN, no lo hubiese comprado."
I was addicted to that game when I was a child. It is still a nice game and worth the price.
"I absolutely loved this game. Played the original for thousands of hours. However the HD edition is so unoptimized its unplayable. Frame drops, lag, and freezing are very common. And im playing off a high end windows 7 rig. I really hope the devs fix the performance issues."
"  If Steam added all the hours I played on the disc copy of this game to my current digital download, I'd likely range in the 2-3k hours. A dear friend gifted me this game for my birthday, so thanks to him! This game. . . .where to start. . . . I grew up playing this game as a kid, and a young teen. This is perhaps one of the most immersive strategy games I've ever played. Overall, I can't find much to fault in it. Everything seems to still be in its respective place.  Age of Empires II is an amazing strategy game, retelling hisoric events, such as memorable battles, the rise of multiple leaders and civilizations (through campaign mode, which is also highly recommended for those of you who like to play alone), and events in history that just captured peoples attention. I think they should institute this at schools for history class instead. It's very accurate to the events/battles/timelines that it covers.  If campaigning just isn't your cup of tea, fear not! There are multiple online servers hosting games almost all the time! You can also play your own private games with friends, in standard games, if PVP isn't really something you want to do, or are extremely good at (like me. I'd probably get destroyed in PVP XD). Lots of civilizations to choose to play as in these modes, so finding the one that suits your playstyle doesn't take long at all.  Feeling creative? Make your own maps and scenarios, with scenario editor! Pick and choose features to add to your maps, and have a blast creating your own battles and maps to play!  I don't generally play strategy games (it's on my to-do list), but I have played this one extensively. All I can say, is GET THIS GAME!!!!! You will not be disappointed :)"
"AOE is just one of my favorite game ever. I've had played AOE for decades, so now it's exciting to see it again with a higher graphics quality and so many memories...  Personal favotite RTS game.  [9/10]"
 What is it?
"The game is a must buy just for showing how your childhood meant for you. It's Age of empires 2, come on. Stop reading reviews and buy. This is the penultimate game you should have in your library."
All time classic and one of the best RTS games of all time.
You can play as Saracens in Scandinavia. 10/10
"Review Aimed to New Players: Yes, it is an old game. Yes, even with the HD enchance the graphics aren't that great. Does it plays as it looks? Nope. While it is indeed an old game, AoEII was known for being so modern in its mechanics that it revolutionized the whole RTS scene to the point that newer games tried to be like AoEII and not the inverse. Considering this, you can see features such like pathfinding, balanced civilizations, mass stack of units, group controls, up to date hotkeys and a myriad of other things common in the RTS of our days. So yes, it is an old game, but it does not play like an old game.  What makes AoEII so good compared to RTS of its time or present time?  - The game is forgiving in small errors because confrontations are focused in tactical endurance and slow advance rather a clash of sweeping offensives. This is one of the few games where when you can truly say 'I may have lost this battle, but not the war!'. So things are more aimed toward who makes more errors (and the importance of those errors) rather about who makes the first error and dies. This add a lot of depth, playability and strategy to the game, both for newbies and veterans.  - You have a myriad of civilizations who specialize in different things and each one posses an unique unit (or some, two). Yet, the bonuses and differences between civilizations aren't sharp, so aside a few particular cases you won't find yourself in the situtation that a civ. pick (or random) can determine the whole match or even influence too badly on it. The civilizations are properly balanced, so you can pick favorite ones and be sure you will rock on it as long you use their advantages wisely (and patches their weaknesses).  - The game is extremely friendly to new people since it includes one of the most memorable tutorial campaigns (featuring William Wallace!) ever made, making sure in a fun and quick way that players can manage the game. While it can take a time to learn about all the units and specific details, since the game only possess four ages and the units upgrades are straightforward, a player can plan an (effective) tactic without much knowledge. The matches can be played on Slow Mode so the reaction and reflect factors of the RTS doesn't hit them hard. There are maps like Black Forest that are easy to wall, thus winning you time to compensate differences in skill levels.  - The Single-Player posses a heck a lot of content with a myriad of different campaigns and random maps. The campaigns (excepts those from the expansion The Forgotten) features an amazing voice acting that will enchance your experience greatly. Wanna learn about medieval history (specially for school/college LOL)? This game and its campaigns will teach you and motivate you like nothing else you can find in your way!  With that said, the game possess a flaw for new players in multiplayer and it is the resource gathering. Actually your capacity to quickly collect resources possess a snowball effect that can put you ahead several minutes (even half an hour!) of your opponent in development, giving an easy win to those who can make a lot of resources in the Early and Middle game. This is easy to improve with some practice, tips or tutorials, and resource gathering is actual fun here with the ever useful villagers (that also rocks as offensive and defensive machines since they can repair key units and position holding building during battle, just like making new main bases or frontline bases to battle). Yet, this can be frustrasting at first when someone wins you only because they handle the resource gathering better.  Nonetheless, this game rulz and I totally recommend it, not only for old and veteran fans, but for new people as well!"
"I remember when I was liittle and I watched my dad play this game,with him not understanding a single english word. It was like 14 years ago. nostalgia taste "
Great Classic RTS Game. Takes me back to my childhood.
I had this game when I was younger. I would subjugate the known world under the rule of a one-world empire and crush all those who opposed me with my mighty iron fist. It was so much fun. But it was also nice to relax after all that by coming home and playing Age of Empires II. Highly Recommended.
"EDIT MARCH 2016: Despite contrary claims by the devs the game's multiplayer is still completely broken to the point of being almost unplayable. To make matters worse, the latest DLC broke the game even more just in time for the developer to seemingly abandon the game in an absolutely devastating state. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN. If you want to enjoy Age of Empires II get the original game and use a free service like Voobly to play multiplayer.  Original review: Maybe the best RTS game of all time with the 'HD' version adding support for widescreen and a few other minor features. The singleplayer campaigns are perfectly playable and just as fun as they were 14 years ago. Steam Workshop makes installing mods very easy.  HOWEVER, the multiplayer has since release been absolutely riddled with bugs and glitches. FPS lag even on high end PCs, far more lag than the original version, many connectivity bugs and lobby glitches, sometimes forcing a lobby to be recreated several times before it actually works . It is not completely unplayable but the multiplayer experience will get very frustrating very quickly. For now I cannot recommend buying this game, if you already have the original version, stick with it, if not, wait until the bugs get fixed or just get the original.  edit: removed the out of sync part, as this has apparently been fixed in the latest update, all other bugs/annoyances are still in though."
One of the RTS classics that is still fun to play.
"Would definitely help developing this game again. Definitely check out The Forgotten DLC *nudge nudge, wink wink*"
"Age of Empires II HD is the higher resolution of the old and good AoE II. This game adds better graphics, better water, mutliplayer lobbies and rankings, more intelligent AI and the DLCs are really nice! The game is still developed and the Steam Workshop compatibility is the best thing ever. Community-made mods like texture packs, tutorial maps, new mods, etc. just revive the game with a factor of 3!   I really, really recommend to buy this game! It's my favourite games so far in the strategy-genre and it's in my Top 5 of best games ever as well!"
"Edit: Patch 4.3 makes the game playable, even in multiplayer! It no longer goes down to 1 fps after some minutes of playing. Great classic game."
"After the great disappointment induced by Stronghold: Crusader HD, I was cynical about the worthiness of remastered games. AoE II HD has really impressed me. Graphics updates look great, Steam Workshop grants access to some wonderful mods, and there is a vibrant multiplayer community playing classic AoE maps as well as fantastic new scenarios, such as Game of Thrones: War of the Five Kings."
" Age of Empires II  was the very first real-time strategy game I played, back in 1999. In my opinion, it remains the best at what it does.  There are many civilizations to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, but all incredibly balanced. The gameplay is very simple and allows for a variety of approaches. There are also many modes for multiplayer and the maps are generated randomly, resulting in unparalleled replay value.  The single-player campaigns are well designed and challenging. Plus, you can learn some History by completing them – I know I did.  The scenario editor is a fantastic tool. It has pretty much kept  Age of Empires II  alive for all these years, thanks to its brilliant and passionate community.  There are some issues, of course. For example, the A.I. leaves a little to be desired and unit pathfinding is not so great, which is made worse by occasional framerate drops during multiplayer matches.  Still, none of these issues are enough to keep you from fully enjoying the game. You can't call yourself a true PC gamer without giving  Age of Empires II  a try.  Even though it's been over a decade since its original release, it feels like the game hasn't  aged  a day. It's a timeless gem."
"For the price, DLC, and updates, you can't beat the price. It costs more to buy the CD at walmart, which is the old version. I played this as a kid and still love it. I love real time strategy games, and wish there was a larger varietry for this great style of gaming. Great for the brain as you work with tactics and learn some history while you're at it."
"Remastered version from '99, there is no need to review this title, really, just go crazy into Wololos once again! [8/10]"
Used an army of monks to convert an entire empire.  11/10
Wololo
"I've played this game for over 8 years now, and Age of Empires II has what most games these days don't have: Replayability. The inexhaustable list of combinations and scenarios with equally diverse results keep this game interesting 17 years after it's inception.   The mechanics and options this game provides manages to be fully featured without becoming overwhelming (I'm looking at you Democracy 3). I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys stradegy games, economy games, military games, city building games, etc. This fufills all of those categories at once.   In the future, I intend to write a full review, but this is it for now."
One of the greatest games of all time
Excellent RTS. A legend and classic.
"I got this game as a Christmas Gift from the person i love the most in this world, of course i wont tell her name out loud in here ^^, i must say it's a really fun game to play, it brings back the memories from back then when i was still playing Strategy games like Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. It's kind off similar to the game which is why i easily adapted with the game mechanics and such. It's fun to play especially with friends since you both can team up to destroy the enemies base. I have played this for not more than a week and i already love it. I would highly recommend you to get the game and start playing it, if you aren't a type of person who likes graphics like this, i would still recommend that you get it, I'm a type of person who looks at the games graphics instead of what it can actually offer, It all changed when i started playing this game. It's fun! :)"
"The original was one of the first games I ever played. And this is pretty much the same game with a some slight graphical changes. If you have never played it before, I would recommend this but to people who grew up with it, the only change is being able to play on modern pcs. 8.5/10"
"I very tentatively recommend this.  'How can you say that?' you might ask, knowing full well that Age of Empires 2 is an excellent game that is widely praised and regarded as a classic. Well, I'll explain.  Age of Empires 2, as a game, is a classic RTS game where you manage a Medieval Civilization, going from a tiny settlement to a sprawling empire. If you don't get invaded first that is. There is a massive focus on combat in this game, most games are decided on the battlefield, with players fielding massive armies against each other to knock out buildings, defences and eventually innocent civilians. But of course, these armies don't come out of nothing, you need to build up some money, gather food, collect wood for buildings and stone for castles. If you aren't familiar with Age of Empires 2, I suggest you look for reviews of that game.  Age of Empires 2 HD is a little different, and not always in a good way.  The upgrades from the original are primarily on the graphical side of things, the updating to a modern lobby-based multiplayer, better mod support and two expansions not originally made for the game. Make no mistake, these aren't all what they're cracked up to be and there's a few problems in this release.  As far as graphics are concerned, the game looks as nice as ever, with only the water reflections, the larger resolutions (which aren't easily adjustable) and a few changed in-game graphics, most of which are welcome additions. To call it HD is perhaps a stretch, but it is graphically superior to its original counterpart.  The modern lobby-based multiplayer is a welcome feature, theoretically allowing for easy and simple online play, without the need for third party clients like Voobly and Gameranger. In practice, the lobby system is very suspect to bugs, with crashes upon game launches occuring frequently and dropouts that halt the game halfway through happening somewhat less frequently. For all the unreliability in Voobly and Gameranger that this system could do away with, it is in many ways inferior, with these problems ocurring less often in either client.  Another couple of things that Voobly and Gameranger players would be able to avoid is the problems that actually happen in-game. Path-finding was never stellar in the original game, but many claim that it has been significantly degraded in this version. Not to mention that the actual game seems to typically run slower, with more log and with more connection problems than it does in Voobly and Gameranger under similar conditions.  The mod support is nice, but the amount of content for AoE2 that isn't on the Steam Workshop is gigantic, which leaves mostly classic and popular scenarios as well as an assortment of other bits and bobs to choose from. Your typical AoE2 player won't be missing out on much, but for those who want really specific things, they might have a hard time to get a hold of them.  And lastly, there's the two expansions. Opinion is divided about these; some say that the new African Kingdoms are extremely powerful, to the point of possibly being imbalanced. And The Forgotten Empires is perceived as being a slew of rather lacking civilizations that don't boast much power, but seem to have very little place in the game. Personally, I think that the African Kingdoms expansion adds a lot to the game and is very fun to play with, even if the new civilizations, particularly the Portugeuse can seem a little tough to play against. As for the Forgotten Empires, it's fun in much the same way, but the civilizations added seem too timid to really add all that much beyond a few interesting unique units and techs to open up a few more strategies than there used to be.  The bugs that make online play well under optimal for such a multiplayer focused game, not to mention one so old and a few of the gameplay problems make me really hesitate to recommend AoE2 HD, because these issues are extremely frustrating and can feel like a dealbreaker. But when the game works, it's as fun as the old AoE2 and sometimes even more so with the higher resolutions, the extra content and the new community. I can't blame you if these bugs get the better of you and you end up going back to Voobly though."
10k hours could be a achievement for this and most would get it pretty quickly. This game has so many hours to be played on. Such a great RTS and nothing will ever beat it ! All time classic worth getting   100/100
"Age of Empires 2: HD edition is an update on the original game.   The first difference is that you have all of the previous DLC/expansions already. So no need to go rummaging around old game stores for the extra campaign mode maps.  The game really does look really nice when playing it on 1080p and the support for multiple monitors is a welcome addition.   Multi-player AOE has never been easier. No need to set up servers, IP addresses and the sort. Just click 'join' and you are in.   Is it worth it though? If its your first time playing Age of Empires, then yes, it will save you a lot of hassle, however if you have played before, you can get the majority of these features via mods to install with your older version of Age of Empire."
Step 1:Make 100 monks and convert enemy army through the walls  Step 2:??? Step 3:Profit 
Buy this. Just do it. Then proceed to cry over and over as you get owned.
My father really love this game !! It's a pretty good game!!
After 250+ hours I'm yet to finish single player level one. For a title published by a company which was named after the founders ♥♥♥♥♥ it's a pretty ♥♥♥♥ hot game.
"  A really fun game, I'm so noob at it and played with my friend with like 100hours on it and wiped my ♥♥♥, He even helped me a bit with the game. Game is dangerous if you're so much into strategy games like this.   +1 if you know what I mean by dangerous, I think it's pretty obvious    9.5/10"
Amazing game!!! So much memories
"Awesome base-building RTS game. Like the old day. - 13 different civilizations to choose, each has its unique units. - Lots of mods and custom AIs to download. - Campaigns, scenarios and skirmish modes. - Age-progression; Dark, feudal, castle and imperial. - Graphics updated, FPS unlocked. - Able to spectate bots game.   When you tired of playing this legend game but then you realized, scripting AIs and watch them fight actually funnier than play it yourself.   Epic war simulator and things. You know."
I can relive my childhood now.
"Amazing game. Filling the gap that AoE Online failed to in my heart, Age of Empires II HD recaptured the Age of Empires experience that I've enjoyed better than most, if not all gaming experiences on this planet.   The community is great, as I have yet to see the classic multiplayer rager who caps locks and types vulgarities into the chat, and most everyone says 'gg' after a match, making Age of Empires II HD one of the most docile and least annoying multiplayer communities I've seen on Steam!  With The Forgotten Expansion, the single player AND multiplayer experience is, in my opinion, doubled in fun. With scores of new and unseen units in the scenario editor, brand new civillizations, and some of the most interesting random maps I've seen, this expansion is well worth the money.  Overall, I highly recommend Age of Empires II HD to veterans of the game, as it will be an amazing and unforgettable nostalgia trip. If you've never played Age of Empires before, it's never too late to start! Also, this game is a great alternative solution to the problems that the CD-ROM of The Conquerors has on modern computers.   "
"Ahh the Nostalgia still as fun ten years later to Conquer your Computer Foes and Next Door Neighbours, I wholeheartdly reccomend this game and can not wait for Age of Mythology HD! Thanks Microsoft as I can finally Rule over my Virtual Empire Again!  P.S. Huns are the best Race if u disagree I can not hear you!"
"I've been playing  Age of Empires  since I was 9 or 10 years old.  That was about  14 years ago,  and no other game has taught me more than  Age of Empires  has. It taught me good english, history, management and fast decision making.  And Age of Empires II does it in the best way."
Still the best RTS game out there. And it´s 2016.
"This game? It was the first game i played of this kind back int 90's, It makes me remenber my old computer, 10 minutes just to turn it on. And just to play this game it was worth. Very fun, nice music, the old ' howdoyouturnthison' and very nice gameplay. Its the best? No. It is worthy? No doubt."
"This was my first PC game when I was young. Now years later, I still come back to it!"
This game...    This ♥♥♥♥ing game...
The best strategy game I've ever played! Nice graphics and audio! The gameplay is very good there can be created enormous battles. The multiplayer works great there weren't any issues. There's a lot of content not only in the game but in the steam workshop. You can download bonus maps and stuff. I really recommend this game its okay to play even without a friend because the missions are really well made. If you like strategy games and have friends buy 2 copies or more because it will be more fun to play together! Rated 10/10!
"I would recommend for everyone to try it out. I love Age of Empires II, I've been playing for more than 10 years and it's still good and now with the HD version, well the game is now made even better!   1,000,000/10"
over 300 games in my library across 3 Steam accounts and this 15+ year old game is the most fun i have ever had....awesome!
"Brilliant game.   One of the best in the genre. Accesible, updated, working on new systems, fully suported multiplayer with no hassle and 100% Steam integration, plus all the singleplayer content from the original Age of Empires 2.   It's a top notch strategy game!  The latest patch released today on 18/06/2015 added the final touches for the smoothest online multiplayer experience yet. The game goes on and a new expansion is on the way."
"Age of Empires II is one of the most timless installments of gaming. It goes without saying that it has essentially become a legend. With the HD release, the game is highly polished and streamlined, making it playable to those who are more accustomed to modern gaming. Continued support of the game through server maintenance and subsequent expansions show that this game will not be allowed to die anytime soon."
"This is not HD. This is a laggy, buggy, ugly remake of old game.  The only 'HD' things in this game is water texture and native capability of hd resolution. Original works better in all other respects and hd resolution cabability is easily added f.ex. by Voobly matchmaking or UserPatch.  Game lags in single and multiplayer, partial fix is setting vsync on (why?) Network lag, timeouts, out-of-sync issues make this unplayable even with gigabit lan network. Adding CPU player guarantees lag from game start. This is now version 2.4(?) and only fixes are essentially UI changes.  Forgotten apparently did not add all the features from original FREE addon and introduced more bugs.  Update: So now this is version 3.8. I decided to check out if game has improved. Lag issue seems to be gone in SP. But about 10 minutes into the game, entire army moonwalked into a forest instead of going by the straight road to ally's town. Ragequit and Back to AoE2..."
good game fun for hours.
"Those of you that haven’t played AoE II in a while will probably have some pretty fond memories of the aging strategy title. You’ll likely think of it as one of the greats; spectacularly innovative, well-balanced and displaying a level of detail that would make Renaissance painters blush. Then … you’ll start the game.  As great as it might be, the number of changes that have been made here are the absolute bare minimum. There are no HD textures, all of the original sound effects and voice clips have been kept, and none of the mechanics have changed. Everything is exactly as we all left it -- for better or worse.  Little in AoE II has aged as well as one might hope. Those used to more sophisticated strategy games might find this golden oldie a bit frustrating. There’s no auto-explore, no unit command queues, no building queues, selecting a group of units will often select stray workers, control groups are pretty limited both in terms of number of units you can select and number of control groups allowed, and worker AI leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Even so, there’s a kind of purity to the whole thing. Micromanagement and care are a lot more important than they have been in years and the lack of affordances and hand-holding gives a rougher but sometimes more precise experience. I found myself setting rally points much more effectively, and I would often dedicate five of my control groups to villagers or workers specifically to help cycle through economic management. For example, in my main lumber-gathering camps, I’d keep one worker in a control group so I could easily reposition the camp, and jump to that group of workers for quick action.  Additionally, I became much more careful with base construction patterns and the arrangement of my buildings and supply lines. Keeping everything organized with so little help from the computer is hard enough, and I figured working around my own foolish base design would make the whole thing intolerable.  This bare-bones approach encourages a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play. There’s no room for complacency; you can't afford to stop moving or quit paying attention. Quite unlike StarCraft, which is often the same for the first three minutes or so of every match -- build worker after worker, secure more food, then crank out some military. At the very least, AoE will have you manually scouting and switching between various starting food sources while also securing housing, wood supplies, and getting everything set-up for the tech advancement. It’s different enough each time that it’s never the same game twice.  Each of the civilizations is also fairly balanced with a few small exceptions here and there. Generally speaking though, the game is a very appropriate gauge of an enormous number of tactical as well as bigger-strategy skills. The game moves fast enough with other competent players that you’ll need to be pretty aggressive to keep up, without being so inaccessible that newer or less well-practiced players will be doomed before they ever start.  Similarly, the campaign will take you through some of the more interesting, albeit distressing, moments in the middle ages. It’s all more or less historically accurate, though handled with a fair amount of tact, such that it never veers into unnecessarily offensive territory. If you can teach your children how to play effectively, it’s honestly not a bad tool to teach them a few things about major historical conflicts. I remember learning about the Aztecs and the city of Tenochtitlan from this thing. Enough that I can still spell that city-name properly with one try. Whoever said games weren’t effective teachers?  In all seriousness though, this game is fantastically well-made, even if it a little rough around the edges. Some of the bigger issues with trying to run the thing on modern computers (such as the color bug, and the mouse scroll bug) have been fixed. Plus AoE II now supports a huge range of monitor resolutions, which is nice, even if we’re still stuck with these old textures, but there is Steam Workshop support so things could change down the line by fans.  All told, while a little frustrating if you’re not into tons of micro-management, Age of Empires II HD with the Workshop and updated multiplayer features is an excellent title. The brilliance of the game’s design is still there, you just might need to look past its age to see it."
"Ja? He, ja Heisse? Das ich soll. Greatest RTS ever. 10/10"
This game is and have been for years the best real time strategy game ever. I have played so many hours and still there is something new to learn on every match.
Converted a catapult to Catholic.   11/10 best game ever!
I LOVE THIS GAME ! childhood memories plus its amazing strategy game with so much missions and stories . and ofc lots of fun playing online with friends and random ppl :D  WOLOLOOOOOOO
"I've been playing since release of conqueror exapnsion, HD version not only fixed compatiblity issues but also improved AI. New AI is more dynamic, so more fun to play. New civilizations added more dimentions to game play. I recommend this game for all RTS gamers."
I think this HD edition is not actually HD. If you play it with 1080p resolution everything is so small so the images have the original resolution. The developers have been a bit lazy making this 'HD' remake.  Age of Empires II Widescreen Edition would have been a better name.
One of the best RTS games ever made.
Play it with my wife on multiplayer! Against 3-4 normal enemies. We build 1 big base with common walls and defences. 1000 units against thousands of enemy units Absolutely fun! We can play one game for 4-5 hours straight.
"This game brings back a lot of memories for me. In this game, you start of in the Dark Age, where you have little resources and villagers. You must build your town, and into a city to defeat the other player(s).   I recommend this game for players who can multitask (No offense), as this game is crazy with multitasking. You need to organise your army, economy and allies.   If you aren't sure to buy it, watch some games of Age Of Empires to get an idea of the game.   In conclusion, this game is well made, and i would recommend it to anyone who love strategy and medieval multiplayer type games.  P.S It would be awesome if they enabled Age Of Empires to be accessable to mac platforms."
"In my opinion, the best RTS ever made. Very well done and balanced, graphics feel chunky at first if you're a newcommer, but very smooth once you get used to it. Playing it with friends is even better. And one of the most important aspects of this masterpiece: it is enjoyable by everyone, whether you're good at the game, or if you're not.  10/10 would put in wishlist if I didn't already have all exp. packs."
"A very fun game, but it's not bug-free. If you and your friend decide to take a break mid-game and save/leave, you can forget about coming back. You can't restore multiplayer games. Online vs other players is pretty hard, or I just suck. Idk yet."
"This was my very first and still favorite RTS game of all time. While I don't particularly enjoy playing online competitively, it's amazing to see a game that was released back in 1998 revitalized by the community. Need I say more? People still want to play 16 years later. It's that good."
Having clocked up more than 700 hours re-playing AoE II and the new 'The Forgotten' Campaigns I have to say this has been the best epxerience of a rejuvinated game.  The Forgotten Campaigns are very well crafted with multiple possible wins. The use of triggers is extensive and some are either/or so if you choose path A path B is not available.  I've really enjoyed playing this game again and the new campaigns are so much better than previous. I already know I will revisit these campaigns.
"AOE 2 is as addictive as crack, but at the same time, as refined as a 30 year old cognac. Package all that into a drop dead gorgeous graphics engine and it's easy to see that Ensemble and Microsoft have a real winner on their hands; AOE is going to be around for a long time. If you've ever liked any other real-time strategy game in this classical style, then you'll clearly see why this one deserves so much credit, even in direct comparison to the finest examples in its category. Needs a sale! Many more people would buy this game if it were put on sale for 5, or even 10 dollars."
Nothing more disgraceful then allying with your so called 'friend' and then later getting sideways penetrated by 20 trebuchets.
Buy it on Sale and enjoy it with your friends! It is amazing while being pretty simple to learn but difficult to master.
"It's classic RTS and is always playable, but this version brings nothing new but a screenmode and unbalanced gameplay. If your going to buy this ok but do not buy The Forgotten expansion. The creators clearly have no idea of game balance or a good scenario.  It's just buggy trash now. The single player mode was so good but now you have ruined the AI for stupid multiplayer. Has anyone beaten Sforza - A New Duke In Milan on hard? Of course you haven't beaten this mission in the latest update. The AI sends everything it has at you, thats red and green sending it's full army at you with you having only 19 troops with no base. By the time you get setup they are on you. Of course there is no murder holes so basically a castle is useless.  You can't build troops fast enough because the AI just hates your villages so much more than you troops. You cannot get a wall up in time and even if you do it gets beat down very fast. This mission was hard enough before you tweaked the AI."
"The original but better and updated. If you liked the original you will like this, if you had slight grievances with the original you might like this as well.  A real game from the era when strategy games were still fun, simple, intelligent and complex at the same time without any one compromising the other"
"You can't really call yourself an RTS fan without playing this masterpiece of the genre first. It may seem a bit basic - train a load of soldiers and build a load of siege engines in order to systematically remove every other player from the map - but the complexity comes from adapting to various different styles of map, as well as learning how each different civilisation works. For example, the Britons have some of the best archery units in the game, but their mounted units are lacking in response. On the other hand, the Teutons have a unique unit that can take a lot of hits but is extremely slow, so they essentially need ranged escorts. And then there's dealing with being krushed (a.k.a. rushed with knights) and being able to reach the Castle Age in under 20 minutes. Oh, and don't even get me started on the absolutely wonderful soundtrack - something that I didn't hear until I got this version, no thanks to having to use a No-CD patch.  However, while this is an incredible game, I feel like Microsoft haven't done enough to call this a true HD edition. Yes, technically it is in HD and this improves the game significantly, but otherwise it has little in the way of improvements, and it's therefore quite expensive for what it is. If you're never going to play multiplayer then try to find it cheaper on Amazon or something, and download the Forgotten Empires mod separately. Otherwise, get it when it's on sale, because fifteen quid is rather a lot of money to be spending on a game that's over 15 years old.  In conclusion, absolutely get this game (when it's cheap) because it is one of the greatest strategy games ever created, alongside Civilization IV and Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert. And to those idiot critics who say the game doesn't play very well, you deserve several slaps."
"An Amazing Game, What i love best about it is how great the multiplayer is, Its just so fun making maps then playing them with my friends. I love this game and I'd highly recommend it."
"The players in an average multiplayer game:  1. The guy whose ping reaches the sky and later gets dropped out 2. The expert who lowered his ELO to 1600 just to completely annihilate lower tier players (often names their game 'noobs only') 3. The guy who blames everyone for the lack of success 4. The guys who get blamed for everything (usually me) 5. + others  Nonetheless, it's great. "
"Let me say this - i love this game.... it made part of my childhood, and i played it during most of it.... but the thing is, it was already a good game back in the day, so this review is not based on that, but on what it improved from the previous one, and the answer is: NOTHING.  Graphics are basically the same, and server lag is so unbelievably bad i can't play with 3 friends againts bots withouth massive lag..... i can play Forged Alliance Forever, a comunity server, with no lag and +400 units, and i can't play a game from 1998 withouth constant freezes -&gt; ARE YOU KIDING ME?  And then, its the 'where is the inovation?' -&gt; where is the unit selection? new unit organization? strategic zoom? being able to put a barracks or archery range on infinte unit production? build or selection queues?  And don't give me the 'the game is already perfect, so it should stay like this'. NO, it was perfect in 1998, now it needed some improvments, not to the core game, but with making it more fun and with less busy work  They are charging 20 dollars for a copy paste game from 1998 but with s**t servers. And for that it gets thumbs down"
"$5 bucks? for one of the best and most nostalgic real time strategy games of all time? MORE THAN WORTH IT.  If you've ever played this game before, years ago, then you already know how amazing this game is already.  And guess what? They've made tweaks to make it even better. Yup.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, and if you've never played an RTS game, how does creating an empire and conquering your enemies sound?  Endless hours of gameplay are available for even single player alone, and even more hours with LAN or even playing online.  The gameplay is pretty simple to learn how to use and play but the tactics go very deep and it can take quite a while to become a master at this game.  This is 5 bucks you won't ever regret.  10/10. "
still the best RTS
Is the best real-time strategy (RTS) video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. I recomend ypu all to support MS for more reconstructed games!

everyone play this game its important
"A HD revival of the classic Real-Time Strategy game Age of Empires II: Age of Kings and it's expansion The Conquerors. Originally released 14 years ago during the golden age of Microsoft Game Studios with classics such as Halo, Rise of Nations, Dungeon Siege, Fable etc. Age of Empires II might be the most acclaimed RTS game of all time, with exceptions of maybe Starcraft and Warcraft due to the importance they had in the competetive scene compared to Age of Empires. Age of Empires never were a real successful tournament title but there has always been small communities surviving throughout the years.  The original game is still available in some Retail stores as 'classic' branded title, often as a third-party release. I bought a DVD copy a few years ago just for the sake of nostalgia, it featured both the 1997 original Age of Empires and the sequel for 9,99€. Yet I instant-purchased AOE2HD when it arrived on Steam. I would've bought it even if it costed me 29,99€ for the sake of getting it on Steam with workshop support, achievements and higher resolutions.  The HD version does not include Any high-definition textures or effects, as one might expect. The game is rather a High resolution edition, supporting up to multi-monitor resolutions, not that it's recommended on a Strategy game, but still neat. Some people argue that the price is too high and the title is false marketing since the game does not feature any HD changes to the textures. Combine that with the amount of issues some people had upon relaese - and you get quite a few disappointed customers.  This game introduced me to Video Games, Age of Empires (1997) was the first game I ever played, at least that's what I remember. The sequel did play an even bigger role throughout my childhood and even up to this date. A supreme LAN title to play with your friends or on your High-schools computer's. No doubt this is the game I have played the most ever. Which does say quite a lot, I regularly return to play some Single or Multiplayer.  Age of Empires II HD recently recieved it's first expansion - The Forgotten. Which adds 5 new Civilizations, 4 new campaigns, a bunch of more units and upgrades, new custom maps and settings. This is probably what fans wanted with the original HD release, since the expansion costs 9,99€ alone. I am still extremely excited for new official content after such a long time!  If you do not have a personal connection to this game then I suggest checking out some videos and maybe look out for a sale. If I were to install the game from my DVD and gotten the fan created high-res support as well as server hosting service (Voobly, GameRanger), then if I would've tried to play online - I would have gotten my ♥♥♥ kicked. This revival resulted in a lot of beginners started playing this game again, which is a very good thing. I get to kick some ♥♥♥ without being a total 'AOE2 Master'. We've seen a lot of classics being revived lately, and I hope publishers and devlopers realise what kind of money a person is ready to spend just to feel like a kid again.   Like Real Time Strategy and don't mind a few dated looks? This game suits you like a glove. Maybe you just want it for the nostalgia? "
"Worse developers ever to have seen and experienced their work. What's even worse is why it had to be this game that they had to screw up..  From the very beginning, it started to smell of poor management. Milking the system having no clue what to do, working for Microsoft...  This game was released in 1999 originally, lets remember that. Now it's released 2013 April and already introduced new bugs. Fair enough, s*** happens and we just have to wait for a fix, but nope, that doesn't come to months later, even when it's game breaking like an 'Out of Sync' error in pretty much 1 in 2 games and sometimes constantly in a row.  There was no beta testing, no alpha, not even a sale, the price was £20.00 for a game that was released and rereleased with no care at all on how much people actually take this game seriously and how much people focused on the little things.  Even now, they release patches that breaks the game, which could have been easily noticed if they had a proper beta testing method. The forums is no help to the community other than random crap you would expect from a game expected to be FINISHED.  It can't get any worse, we assume, but that I can't confirm, as I thought that last year.. Slowly things are being resolved as time goes by, but no credits are warrented in my opinion, given anybody can do anything in 100 years.  I recommend this game, because it's my favourite game of all time, but under control of crappy people. If I had enough money to buy them out, I would and make Age of Empires truely the epic it should be."
"Doesn't matter if you made the water look pretty or added workshop support. It's still a game from 1999, it's nearing its 20th birhtday, give it a rest, put it out of its misery.  A common thing 'back then' was to release a game that reached an old age as freeware/open source, so the eager community can expand its number of fanatical worshippers, work on further modding and all the good stuff, today? Today you shamelessly take a game thats rattling its bones on the deathbed, and release it in SUPER MODERN HD VERSION™.  Its bones are screeching, its whining, 'free me from the pain!' is what the game is shouting at them, 'end it all!', but the devs put on their best business smile and put the game out onto steam with a 20$ price tag.  20$ price tag! For a game thats 17 years old (as of 2016)!  And the 'expansions' which are 10$ each amount to 20$ extra, if you want the full experience you have to gash out 40 grand. The game didn't cost that much when it came out, and with steam you don't have the excuse of printing disks, shelf space, or included collectibles.   It's a disgusting business practice, and you idiots eat it up! Game after game, everything windows releases in a badly running HD version, you get and pay them mad cash, admit it, they've had you!  Same with the homm 3 remake, and any other HD remake, 'oldschool fans' will pay exorbitant fees to rent (steam is a renting service, read the EULA next time) a game from their childhood, and leave raving positive reviews about how fun the game is, and make it reach a 90% positive rating on steam, despite being decrepit and barely working.  Industry crash when?"
Multiplayer is fantastic and the HD upgrade is brilliant!
It's a good game. AOE2 always was. But the HD version is dreadful. It's very very poorly performing even on an intel i7 system and the hd graphics really aren't much better than I remember from the old version. It's not a 'wow' thing like the monkey island remake or something.
"Although this game is a classic these days it brings nothing new (as expected), it's mainly for those who feel nostalgy for old AoE II. The game is slow and very repetitive - in the economic matter of speaking : collecting food, wood, gold, recruit repeat - but it does its job, entertains you for hours. As the most potential feature I consider multiplayer, playing with real life opponents makes everything more interesting and harder than with AI.  7/10"

"Age of Empires was a great game, but this might be one of the worst updates I've ever seen. The menus look like they were upscaled from the original by a guy who was told he only had 5 minutes. The interface is tiny with no ability to customize. The units hard to find, hard to control, and, stunningly, the interface still runs slow at that! Trying to drag a box around some units is CHOPPY! In a 15 year old game!  If you *love* AoE 2 and just want to play it on Steam, then this is a fine purchase. But if you want *anything* else, this is pretty damn weak."
"Great game, well worth the money."
"Although this game came out many years ago, i have to say that this is one of the best, if not the best RTS games out there!  The in depth upgrade routes and the way you advance throught the ages completes a very gripping game that does not get old for a long time!  The different countries and troops that can be created is mostly unique to each faction which gives this game a gem that is no longer hidden.  There are some bugs in this game, but these bugs do not affect the gameplay much at all.  I know my steam profile only has a few hours on its list, but i had this game on disc back in the day and that is where 99.999% of my hours come from.  I give this game a 8.5/10"
"my review of this game, with my opinion. ( note that this is my first review )  first i will talk about the cons of the game, ill save the pro's for later. - the game uses the 'genie engine' wich is a old engine, originaly used by the old age of empires. the engine is weak and outdated, there are some big maps in this game wich the engine does not quite support. i also get in some trouble when play with more than 3 friends with the population cap set to 500, probably because of the engine as well. i am using a gaming pc, and i still have this problem, so it can not be because i have potato specs.  - unit pathing is horrible, units will often get stuck or regroup in weird ways, this left me to lose a couple of battles. - the isometric view of the game is iconic and comfortable but also gives fair amount of trouble because some things are unclear to see. - maybe a bit hard to get into the multiplayer, but practice against bots easily customizable, and playing with friends gives you great benefits ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) in learning the game. - 20 euro's is a bit expensive for a game that basicly is from 1999, even when remasterd, it is and stays the same game.  pros - everlasting graphics style, the graphics stayed the same since 1999. - random maps bring a constantly new experience to the game. - a lot of different civilizations to choose from, with each unique units and every civilization can use unique tactics to win the game. this causes a unending stream of experience and replayabilty. - multiplayer is fun, and had great modification options to optimize the game to everyone's needs. - steam workshop, with nice and usefull content. - single player campaigns with voice over. - every unit has its counter, wich makes nice gameplay. - co-op against bots, is a very nice way to learn the game and have fun, while still being challenging. - improved unit cap over the old age of empires. - new dlc's with nice content. ( civilzations, voiced campaigns, maps ) for decent pricing. - the game is often on sale and easy to get. - it is playable on older pc's/ laptops.  the final verdict. in my opinion this game set a standard for rts games, the hd remaster give's a nice nostalgia feel, while still being refreshing. i played the old age of empires when i was younger, and it is almost the same, but this new age of empires brings great improvements, personally i would never spend 20 euro's on a game like this. and i waited for one of the regular sales. it is a nice game to play with friends ( if you have any that is ). i personaly would give this game a 7,5/10  it is a good game, but has some mayor flaws, the biggest must be the outdated engine.  i hope this review was usefull, good luck aging."
one of the best games i've played ''Legend''
"This Game Is just Madness, sick game i just love it!!!!  I had to buy it 5 years after i played it last time (had about 1000 hrs in game), it kills time so easy. :)  I totally recommend this game,"
"I spent so many hours as a kid playing this amasing game and now its better that ever, could lose weeks to this befor you know it."
"Age of Empires series was supposed to be the best series around - as I've read through many and many reviews. Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot.  Basically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS.  The only downside to this Age of Empires 3 versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 2 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's.  If I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me.  I would give it an 8 if it had something to differentiate itself from other RTS of it's class, but  RATING : 7.3/10       Gameplay   B     Story / Campaign   B     Visuals / User Interface   C+     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   B-     Overall    B-    "
"AoE 2 is among the best rts games ever made. It's a classic. It's a legend. Building your own empire is really addictive and this game can easily be played for hours without getting bored. I'm so happy they made a hd version of it for Steam. It has some performance issues with the two largest map sizes but I can forgive that, since the game is so awesome. I highly recommend getting all the dlc's as they bring a lot of new civilizations and campaigns to the game. This game is also suitable for casual players like me, since the ai isn't too difficult to beat on the easier difficulty levels. I rate this game 9/10. Totally worth your money."
10/10
"Picked this up in a sale for $3 and have not regretted it at all. While not much has really changed from the original game despite the addition of 'HD' and apparently better AI, still the great classic rts game that I remember it to be. Also, as of writing this, there are working online servers, with working multiplayer being a major addition to the replayability of this game. Would recommend."

" The latest 5.0 patch has fixed the crashes, desyncs and performance issues that this game had on steam. So after that is taken out of our mind...    This is one of the oldest, classical and nostalgic game ever, and I'm not exaggerating !   The multiplayer playerbase is very good, it's been growing, it still a little bit too competitive, but I'm actually trying to show people some custom maps that were made by the community a long time ago which are very popular (such as Lord of The Rings maps, jurassic park, RPGs, etc...)  Anyways the only thing that's missing for me is an option for custom resolutions.   Final score:"
"I was about 6 years old when this game came out (not the HD version of course). I remember that i used to watch my uncle play this at the office when there weren't any clients around and ask myself why he found this game so amusing. At that time i was playing a demo version of 'Lego Racers' when cereal boxes used to give you CD-ROMs. I asked him to get me the full version of that game, at that time and i couldn't understand what a 'download' was, he simply was that computer wizard who could get me anything i wanted. There wasn't 'unlimited internet' at that time, we used to turn off the phone when we wanted to get online so i never got the chance of playing 'Lego Racers' and i got a zip file with 'Age of Empires II' instead.   For many months i watched that folder on my computer and then i decided to play it. I remember playing with 'El Cid', i didn't understood English at that time so i never got the first level completed. I tried to run from 'King Alonso' and i never understood why i couldn't complete my mission. Years have passed, i played single player games with bots and learned the basic mechanics of the game. I've got 'Age of Empires III' and my uncle was still playing 'Age of Empires II' and i couldn't understand why once more. Why should he prefer it when there was a game wich was 'the next' and with so better graphics?  I am 22 years old now, i learned a little of English and i have my internet access to do whatever i want. 'Lego Racers' used to be my favourite and i never played it anymore, i played lots of 'Age of Empires III' and got the collection on Steam to remember me what great games are. On 'Age of Empires II', i went back to the 'El Cid' campaign, fled from 'King Alonso', got some villagers, built my empire and tried to destroy him without the game asking me to. I have failed miserably but this time i did just because i wanted.  'Age of Empires II' is a really well made game, i am not experienced in the 'HD version' but i found many bugs that should be corrected. I am currently playing the game hoping that i could beat every campaign but sometimes it's just impossible. Besides that, i don't know why i can play this game for 6 hours straight, i can't understand why this game is better than 'Age of Empires III' but in all of this years i can tell you this: my uncle was right all the time for playing it and if you are reading this you are making the right choice.   Note: I am trying to help others and get help by making a steam guide so feel free to check it out. "
A must buy for Warcraft 3 fans.
"Better than what most people have been saying. The ability to use widescreen, sharper images, and even multiplayer! Plus the added benefit of using Steam so you can install it and use it anywhere easily!"
"Age of Empires II HD is a 2013 High Definition remake of the classic real-time strategy game, Age of Empires II released in 1999. The original game remains intact and is still alot of fun to play; However, with this new HD Edition, you can also play with user-generated content through the Steam workshop and on Steam servers. The HD Edition of AoE2 also comes with, The Conquerors expansion, and features multiplayer the same as the original version.  Overall, I think they did a pretty good job of resurrecting a classic. I have fond memories of playing AoE2 for hours both through the varying single player modes as well as through multiplayer. It is nice to polished up a little and making the rounds for newer gamers who didn't have the pleasure of playing the original."
"While i'm not great at this game, i never got to play Age of Empires 2 when i was younger, i played Rise of Nations instead (will make that review later) this game has to be one of my favorite rts games ever made, large scale warfare, knights in armor, multiple factions, steam workshop integration, there's tons of maps and mods you can download if you get bored, (this review is a work in progress, i'll update it once i play more and get the forgotten expansion) "
"I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.  One Hour Reviews - Game 2 Age of Empires II HD Purchase Date: 6/13/2015  Unlike most of my Steam games that I haven't played, this one I just picked up in the most recent summer sale. I played the original Age of Empires II way back in the day, but I didn't remember a lot of specifics. Generally I am not a fan of real time strategy games, but I remembered actually liking this one, so I decided to pick up this new version on sale.  An hour doesn't get you very far in an RTS game. You can have multiplayer matches go longer than that. But I spent my hour going through the tutorial, which does a good job getting you up to speed on things. If you've played an RTS game before, then the concepts introduced in the tutorial will be very familar. It's all about harvesting resources to enable you to build buildings which let you train different units so you can attack and defend.  Because this is an older game (albeit an updated version of one), it's missing a few things that you'd expect from more modern games. For one, you can't change the resolution of the game. You can run full screen or windowed mode. You also can't zoom in or out of your map. I kept wanting to use my mousewheel to scroll, but this game predated the use of scrollwheels in games.   The one thing that really stuck out as annoying was the placement of the icons at the top of the screen, which are for various menu options. The problem is the icons are rather small, and also when you move your mouse to the top of the screen, it will scroll the map up. It' nearly impossible to click a menu option without also making the map scroll.  The tutorial was pretty fun, and does a good job of easing you into the game without overwhelming you at first.  From what I can tell, the HD version of this game actually changes very little. The graphics and textures look the same. I think this was more about making the game playable on newer machines with widescreen resolutions. Also it adds Steam Workshop support which is a nice bonus (although my one hour in the game didn't include anything to do with the workshop).  I can see where some might be turned off by the lack of updates here. But I would argue there is something to be said for keeping the game as it is, warts and all. This isn't intended to be Age Of Empires IV, so I don't think it should be judged as such.   Overall Recommendation: Keep  "
"Leave your girlfriend, is one of thsoe games."
fun game but i suck at everything apart rushing and my friends want to castrate me when i rush rip
"When Microsoft re-released Age Of Empires II as the HD Edition, I can't tell you how excited I was. With widescreen support, updated graphics and interfaces, multiplayer and workshop support, this classic game that I binge-played as a kid just got even better. I've deposited countless hours into this game growing up and played local-multiplayer with my sister every day. In later years we used GameRanger to play multiplayer verses other players, even though it wasn't super ideal.   In my opinion, Age Of Empires is one of the greatest RTS games to date... even though I play very few RTS games, the ones I have played pale in comparison. AOE II has a deep upgrading and leveling system per game and a very large varity of tribes to choose from, each offering their own special units. You can play on a variety of maps and gamemodes, including ones you can create in the map editor. This is where the Steam workship really comes into play, easily being able to download custom maps in minutes.   The map editor itself is something I could talk about for a long time because it is so advanced. I'll keep it short though and say that under it's surface are the options to create detailed and custom campaign scenarios or maps with custom triggers and plenty of props. If you have the time to invest into the map editor, there are no limites to what you can create.  Age Of Empires II holds up really well for being 15 years old, and if you love any kind of RTS game, Age Of Empires II HD without a doubt should be in your collection. The new expansion packs they added is also a must have, adding new features, maps, and units while keeping it true to the origonal game."
"HD or not, Age of Empire 2 : The Age of Kings is a gem that evolved from the stone age and tribal wars of the first Age of Empire. Those regular arrows can set a castle on fire and turn it into a pile of debris! Medieval warfare at his best!  Rating : 9.5"
"Just the same great game I remember, but looks a little bit better. If you liked AoE II years ago, there's no doubt, then, that you'll like this as well. My only quip, though. is that the multiplayer is extremely laggy with more than a few people to the point that it's unplayable at times. Otherwise, the single player is extraordinary and alone is worth the price."
"As an owner of the original disks, I love this version. Runs seamlessly on Windows 7, virtually no load/buffer times during the campaign (random maps compile quickly), and looks so clear and perfect (old one works, but it requires tweaks in 7 to run). It is the original game with the Conquerors expansion; Forgotten is a whole new bit of content.  You'll lose yourself on random map plays, playing against as many as 7 other players (whether AI or live) to forge alliances, rivalries, and battle to the last man standing or to be the most successful.  It's simple strategy games like this that you can truly enjoy and is up there on my list with Civ V, Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, and Warcraft III as just another game I can sit down and play for hours."
"One of the best strategy games out there.Campaigns are about real historical events like:Hundred Years War,Holy Roman Empire,Mongol Empire and many more.Every civilization has it's unique technologies,units and upgrades , very fun to play with friends and others. If you like strategy games then you should definitely try this. :)"
"Key Highlights:  Re-mastered for high resolution displays 1080p+  Enhanced visual engine with improved terrain textures, water, fire and ambient lighting effects  **************************************************************************************************** Age of Empires II HD Edition is nothing but a money grab, targeting people like me and you who enjoyed this game as kids, saying the game has 'improved' and charging $20 for it.  Because for many different reasons I'm disappointed with AoE II HD and I dont recommend if you're looking into a really improved AoE II especially if youre into historical/cultural accuracy, except for some graphical upgrades!  I remember playing AoE &amp; AoE II as a kid, and still have the original Discs with original covers, theyre great games and fun, but I wouldnt say the same thing for AoE II HD Edition, because I dont really see improvements to justify the $20 bucks.  First of all, there are many different nations to play but many of them STILL share the same 3D models! Same buildings, structures, units even though they are different nations and had different architecture and style.  Developers didn't bother to create new 3D-models and improve the game (As they wrote in key features), instead they slightly upgraded the engine and the graphics.  I've asked them about these issues, they responded and told it's not going to be easy to create new 3D-models as it requires skill, time and a lot of cash.   But in my opinion if Modders are able to create their own models and import them into the game it should be a piece of cake for developers to do that, and if they cant do that Im sorry but they should look for a new job.  I was hoping for improvements over the original ones but sadly those flaws are still there, and its very annoying for this age, Byzantine Empire monastery is actually a mosque (This is unforgivable), then Ottomans have the ability to recruit Chivaliers (SERIOUSLY?) These are just 2 examples, there are dozens of and many other flaws such as Multiplayer problems.  I also note that its not something really 'HD' other than Widescreen support and slightly upgraded graphics.  Original Age of Empires &amp; Age of Empires II sure are great games, I enjoy them myself but I dont recommend the HD edition unless you really want to bring some nostalgia and dont have the original discs and dont mind to throw $20 on it.  I will edit this review and write more about this game later on, thats all for now."
Wood Please
"Great Game, shame the newest patch has literally destroyed the online. Getting more than 2fps is a gift. Really shouldnt be having these problems these days"
"Multiplayer function is buggy and broken, restore game function doesn't work at all. Do not buy until the studio addresses glaring issues."
"10/10  I can never in all my life not recommend this game. I loved it, and first played it when I was younger than 8 years of age. As of now, I've become so familiar with this game I've almost taught myself completely how to use triggers, and make some epic campaigns. It's fun, it's stratergy, it's none other than amazing, I've adored it all my life. I highly recommend this masterpiece Microsoft published so long ago, and am quite ecstatic that they released it to Steam."
"Why are you reading reviews? It's Age of Empires II, just buy it and have fun for years!"
"Don't get me wrong, this isn't everyones type of game; But what rests behind the cover, is an adventure of Knights and Sand People. Take part in the still popular cult following of the Age Series, by buying this gem and spaming the monk chant over and over again. And when you are done, you can thank me for getting you to waste your christmas money on this master piece."
"One of the best games on Steam. Such a classic. Glad to see it blooming with life in the multiplayer section.  It is an acquired taste to the casual gamer however once the basics are understood, it is easy to understand why this game is truly a timeless classic."
"I never have played that game before, but because I played the first Age of Empires a lot in my childhood, this game was bound to be liked. But still, I didn't get a nostalgicgasm (Something you experience when you play a game, that you already played as a child, years later. It creates the Illusion that, even if the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ or the graphics are from the stone age, the game is awesome.) because of the said reason.  If you like RTS Games or the Age of Empires franchise, get this game. If it's too expensive for you, get it on a major sale like the Steam Summer Sale and don't hesitate to buy the DLCs as well when you're at it."
the nostalgia.. still a classic and great fun in multiplayer
Build a navy
"My review will be in two parts, one for the normal version and one for the forgotten expansion.  Part: 1  You can play as floatin iron turtles that spit giant rocks. (Koreans)  10/10  Part: 2  The forgotten expansion add the following amazing bonus features:  You can play as angry Russian axe murderers on horseback. (Slavs) 'nuff said 10/10"
A nice upgrade to the old graphics and one of my favorite strategy games of all time
"Age of Empires II was certainly my favorite game back in the days. Incredibly well made, engaging and educational! And now it got a much needed HD update. Indeed, an update worthy of the game itself. The title screen had an almost hypnotic nostalgia effect on me; I just sat there for a minute or two listening to the music and admiring the details that have aged so well. The seamless transition to HD quality was without a doubt perfectly executed. The game hasn't lost any of its original charm and after a few moments it feels right at home. What's more, I particularly enjoyed the new music that seemed to fit in so well with the gameplay, adding this much needed dramatic effect. Although I played only the first mission of Barbarossa, I found it immensely entertaining. The amount of user-generated content for this game is bewildering, in a good way. Hundreds of achievements, Steam powered lobbies and future official content to come, what more could one ask for? I couldn't think of any game more worthy of such revivification."
"HD Edition has enormous potential. The base game is still enjoyable and visually attractive (excepting the units that were never beautiful), and you can smoothly download content from the Steam Workshop. However, the HD edition fails to improve on the original's gameplay in any way, and numerous bugs mar what should be an excellent multiplayer experience. Hopefully, Hidden Path will eventually fix the problems so that epic eight-player matches with hundreds of units on each side can entertain strategy fans until our civilization, like ancient Rome, falls and fades into the annals of history.  Multiplayer is a buggy, broken mess :("
"Cool game, but it is inacceptable that after all this time there are still bugs. The most annoying one is that I CAN'T RESUME SAVED MULTIPLAYER MATCHES!"
Still the best RTS
"Firstly it is a great thing seeing one of my favourite RTS games appearing on steam, as it has given rebirth to AOE2 after many years. Though I first played this game when I was 12 yrs old i.e some 4-5 years back(not a long time). Though I don't have many play hours on my steam account but I can say with a 100% guarantee that I've played this game for more than 500+ hours with the old disc version.   Secondly, as the title says 'Age of Empires II:The HD Edition', I will only say that its no worth buying if you're buying it for some improved graphics as it has only some minor(0.01%) graphics change(or say texture change) only on reflections of water and the colour of cliffs. Other than that its just the old AOE2.  But the good thing is that it has multiplayer which is no dead and you can easily find a decent amount of people playing online.  In short here are the pros &amp; cons of this version of game-  PROS- 1.Multiplayer reborned 2.Buy this if want to remember some good old memories of this game(having it on steam) 3.For new players I would say you should try playing this best classic RTS game if you want to. 4.Some minor changes like-  -Select more than 40 units in a row(not sure how much, maybe 50 or 60)  -Supports a maximum of 500 population limit in standard game mode.  CONS- 1.Don't buy if you're concerned only with the HD graphics. 2.Its no remastered edition, its just an old AOE2 with steam workshop and steam trading cards available. But yes it has multiplayer to play.  I really don't mind its graphics as I am fine with its old retro style graphics. But they should have improved its graphics as it says 'HD Edition' which it is not :C  Finally, I'm happy that it is on steam, and also the developers are releasing new contents for this game."
lots of fun just like the old days of endless aoe
not my childhood (borned in 1998) but im a gamer who also loves these oldies and other old time classic games also i like strategy games this is just awesome
"Really good, also i played it alot when i was a kid"
its the best rts ever in my opinion
"I made a Video &amp; Text review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtLu3XNKHNk  Both are the same. Text below.  What is age of empires? Age of empires is a classic real time stragery game. In Age of empires you are the wel.. hmm i think you are the king of a little kingdom. You always start of with three or four villagers and one scout Your main goal is to defeat the enemy king which also has a village somewhere out there on the map You'll need to issue orders to your villagers and get them to work, villagers gather resources such as stone, wood, gold and food You don't need to literally feed your people, but if you wish to recruit more villagers you will need to spend a one time payment to start the creation of a villager which will then be recruited. As you gather supplies you will become able to build various buildings such as the barracks, archery range and stable. All the buildings require a certain amount of supplies in order for you to build them for your kingdom. which are all used to recruit a certain type of unit. The blacksmith is in turn used to upgrade various aspects of your units such as armor, line of sight and firing range.  As you play you develop your own village or perhaps should i say kingdom. You will become powerful and eventually lose or win the game by defeating the enemy king or getting defeated by the enemy king.  Once you have acquired a good base of supplies you may head over to your town center and advance to the next age. Once you advanced to the next age, new buildings will be unlocked.  It might seem easy but it definitely is not. The ai is what i call the typical AI. The first moment it stands idly by, while it attacks with everything and everyone a moment later. Even though the AOE II HD development team worked on the AI i still find the AI rather vanilla with it's behaviour not greatly enhanced. I did notice that the AI actually sends siege weapons in and archers for targets that infantry can't reach but the AI has a habit of sending it's unit's one by one to their death.  You can age-up a couple of times. You start at the foot age and then age up to the feadul age.  After the feudal age comes the castle age and the last age would be the imperial age. Everytime you wish to age-up you will need to possess a certain amount of goods to pay your age-up with. Once you reach the castle age you will unlock siege weapons which could be essential for taking down castle's and other fortified buildings.  and we've got a perfect example right here right now. As you can see the AI has various units just standing there doing nothing. They are literally waiting to get attacked or for an enemy to get close enough to them. It usually takes a while for the AI to actually start attacking you, but when it does it does attack you good. As you could have guessed, i do am playing on the easyest difficulty right now.  civilizations and upgrades  As you play you unlock new upgrades everytime your civilization advanced age. Once you build the proper building, let's say a library.. many new upgrades will be unlocked and made available for research You could for example then research stronger armor, sharper arrow, longer range, faster units andnew attach methods etc.  At the end of the game you will still be able to view the good old timeline. Showing the stats of all players who participated in the game. You can view military stats, economy stats, technology stats the society stats and of course the general timeline.   There are various civilizations a player can pick to play as. Each civilization got it's own bonus. Be it cheaper units, faster unit recruitment, unique buildings and so on..  what is new? The game has been released again under the name of age of empires 2 HD. However, there hasn't honestly been anything new despite the steam workshop and the steam multiplayer function. The textures do look indeed much sharper than they used to do. But then again they still exist out of visible pixels.  The expansion pack they brought really didn't bring much to the game and is to be more of a mod. Luckily there are active members in the steam community wish dedicate their time working on mods and new content.  There do is some new fancy music which i actually liked instantly. It literally settles the mood properly and brought me back into the good old age of empires II atmosphere. There also are a couple of achievement a player could earn for defeating players and acquiring certain achievement. But other than that? No, there isn't much new.  Steam workshop integration One of the amazing things the developers added is the steam workshop integration. This allows steam users to access new content such as textures but also new or additional units! And if you are creative, you may contribute to the community yourself. I find this a very good new addition myself, this way the AOE developers no longer need to release new content for the game. Now, the community could do it for them!  multiplayer  it is amazing that you can now play age of empires ii online and on steam without having to port forward your router. But it still got it's flaws. Even though you're using a network and are no longer using telephone line to play multiplayer the game still suffers from constant performance drops and internet delays which only occur at multiplayer games.  Final verdict  The game is good, it is still good. It's lovely how the online option and steam workshop was added. That surely brings the game back to life. However, the game itself hasn't changed. So if you're planning to purchase the game again for the single-player whilst having  it on an old disk somewhere then do not purchase it, the game is the same. It's the online and workshop you should purchase the game for."
"Epic game with hours of campaign gameplay and even the ability to create custom campaigns. This game is the absolute best strategy game i have ever seen it is real time, non-tile-based, and with so many unique civilizations and maps it is really just an epic. "
"Old, yet still a great game."
"I reccomend this game for those who like fun, strategic games. Its a little old, but still quite funny and such a good game."
"AOE2 HD is just like the beloved original, with the only diffrence lying in 'steam workshop' support, better functionality on modern operating systems and much smoother menu transistions and multiplayer support.  Pros: Just like the Original  Steam the return of old school Aoe2 online gameplay  Workshop allows users to share mods and maps in an easier way then before.  Cons: Most of the shortcommings of the original game are still present, e.g bad villager pathfinding.  Graphically, the game is identical with the exception of '3D water', new flame and cliff sprites, therefore not a true HD remake (However their are many texture packs on the workshop which rectifies this)  For what is esentially a 'get this game running better on modern operating systems', the game is fairly expensive at 27euro with its expansion pack (Which was also a free mod). Alternatives to this exist as freeware in the form of ports such as Voobly.  No Manual way of changing resolution  Steam overlay often bugs during the stats screen and after a game in the main menu.   Despite all of this, it is still the Aoe we all know and love, with some modern conveniences. So, yes I would definatly recommend this game to anyone remotely intrested in true RTS gaming, in a world were old school RTS games are ridicilously difficult to find.  RATING: 68/100 (Good) Most of that mark is because it is AOE2 with multiplayer that actually works. However the lazy nature of this 'HD Remake' must be taken into consideration to anyone wishing to purchase it. Value for money is not very high, at 27 euro one can purchase other Remakes such as RIse of the triad or Serious sam HD, but at the same time Aoe2 fans like myself are not likely to turn down this offer.  EDIT 2016:  Much of what I said earlier still stands however the state of the game is much more polished and the addition of the expansions as well as the balancing accompanying them have made it a far more enjoyable experience, at least to me. Stability has increased dramitically with it being able to run at an uncapped FPS without issues.  If I were to give it an ambigious rating, it would increase to around 75 as really the easy of access and the community they have created here is well worth the price of admission."
"I highly recommend this game to my friends. This is a classic, technically perfect strategy game as far as I'm concerned. I've been playing this game since it came out as released by Microsoft in the 90's. What's fun about it? -Historical perspective on races in a RTS game -Historical battles -Great look to the graphics -Works very well on low-end systems -Economy is fun to manage -Micro and macro contorl are easy and fun to manage -Good variety of different strengths to the various races -Story mode is fun -Just playing agains the computer AI is fun -Very easily customizable"
lots of fun just like the old days of endless aoe
"Really good, also i played it alot when i was a kid"
not my childhood (borned in 1998) but im a gamer who also loves these oldies and other old time classic games also i like strategy games this is just awesome
"Age of Empires II was and still is one of the greatest RTS titles of all time, known for it's fast-paced, macro-oriented but still very micro-intensive gameplay.   The HD version has left the core game untouched, only boosting the graphics, improving networking, adding matchmaking and enabling steam workshop support. In one way this is great because it stays true to the original game for nostalgic value and so professional/competitive players won't shun the game for being 'casualized' or ruined for minor changes. On the other hand this is a huge amount of lost potential. To be perfectly honest, Age of Empires II was a very flawed title - I mean don't get me wrong, I love the game and it was amazing when it first came out... but it hasn't aged as well as it could have. No pun intended.  I still think the game is incredible and well worth the purchase, but I would have liked to see them do more than just port the game over. A more advanced map editor, better mod support, more interface options, more potential. All things that don't really affect the 'competitive' scene but give the rest of the audience (probably 99%+ of players) something to play around with.   The original AoE 2 gets my full 10 out of 10 score, but this 'HD' version is just a sloppy port. $20 is a little steep to re-purchase a game that came out in '99, but hey, if you love the series then I guess it's worth it.  Original Game: A+, timeless classic HD Remake: C-, could have been better"
"I have been playing Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors off and on since 2004. When this HD version was released I had to get this masterpiece of a game. This game is my all-time favorite RTS game a long with Empire Earth and Stronghold Crusader!! Buy this game- can spend tons of hours in this game! I also recommend The Forgotten DLC- it adds new civs to this game and also has 4 new campaigns which are pretty fun so far. Highly recommend  Not to mention have put over 300+ hours into this game when I first started playing this back in 2004. This game is without a doubt my all-time favorite game!!!  Also, let me say that I bought both the Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and The Conquerors on disk and it was so good that I bought it again on Steam! In my opinion, this is the best RTS game ever made. Amazing game!!!!!"
"First of all: this game isn't all that different from the original version. The units and textures are mostly the same the original game (although to be fair, where they have been changed - cliffs, farms, resource icons - people have complained bitterly - so much in fact, that the new farms were reverted back to the original farms).   Time to update my review somewhat:  In the mean time, two expansions have been released and brought fresh civilizations, maps and techs to the game. Both are definitely worth getting.   The game is still recieving developer attention, although progress has been addmittedly very slow and patchy. Neverthless, things are slowly moving in the right direction; bugs are gradually being fixed and in general the experience is improving. It's certainly playable at the moment although plenty of people whine in the Forums about all kinds of diverse issues.   So, in conclusion: If you liked the original Age of Empires II, you are in for the same experience here, except that the game is now once again being supported by Microsoft. It is not a modern game with fancy graphics, it is an old classic that been reinvigorated with new life.  The standard price for the game seems rather steep to me, so I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale to get it."
"Amaziiiiiinng!  I really enjoy those Graphics from 1999 , the gameplay is pretty nice , many choices of civilzations that have their own unique units and technologies. The AI acts sometimes pretty dumb or just terrible.  Graphics : 9/10 Gameplay : 9/10 Story : 7/10 Supports Workshop and Map Editor 2+  Overall : 27/30  "
"I play that game 8 years now and Age of Empires is still the best strategy game ive ever played. The gameplay is nice, the campaigns are very good. Top Game ^^"
An awesome game of my childhood brought to Steam!
"UPDATE 12/8/14: I have continously updated this review to reflect the status of the game due to the HD AI being absolutely broken (28 of my in-game hours were spent frustrated with the AI, trying different scenarios/maps/difficulties, etc. to try to get the game to work as intended; details listed below in cons list). Oddly, there is a 'fix' that is so buried in the discussion boards that it took me multiple searches since March 2014 until now (December 2014) to find it and revert the AI to the original and more perfected Age of Empires II AI. When you select Single Player, each ally/enemy has an arrow list that says 'Computer.' Click on it and change it to 'The Conquerors AI,' and finally, you can play the game without issue. I cannot stress enough: the new AI is a broken mess, and this game would NOT be worth it if it weren't for this option. I am giving the HD version a 'recommended' because it does, in fact, have an easy and accessible fix to its greatest flaw.  Now, on to my original review.   This is one of the best strategy games of all time, and my personal favorite. Despite already having a hard copy of this, I wanted to support it through Steam as well. For those of you who have this game already but were looking for the differences in the original and Steam version, here are some pros and cons I've seen thus far:  Pros: -As an owner of the game on Steam, you have access to the DLC that was recently released (The Forgotten Expansion), that you wouldn't have access to with the hard copy. -This has an active community that uploads mods, taunts, maps, and more through the Steam Workshop. -Some of the HD upgrades (the water, for example, which has waves that move unlike the original) add nice flair.  Cons: -Many people who have bought the game are experiencing glitches or lag of some sort. Though most claim to experience lag, I have yet to see this myself. -I have personally seen the negative side to the reworking of the original AI. If you play single player against CPU opponents, be prepared to be underwhelmed with your allies and downright confused by your enemies. For my first skirmish, my AI allies did nothing but collect resources and create a handful (less than 10 in every case) of combat units. This is compared to the disc version, where CPU allies would create massive armies to aid you in completely demolishing enemies. Further AI problems include building up armies just to hold them at a standstill for an hour plus of in-game time, ally AI armies standing in the midst of MY town center to where selecting my units was impossible (due to a multitude of their units blocking my way), units that simply stop doing ANYthing, where you either must overwhelm them with numbers or win via non-combat means, and the enemy AI straight-up gaining resources that do not exist (AKA cheating; this is also an issue discussed in the forums) on moderate difficulty or above. Basically, the game's AI is completely broken, but this CAN be fixed by the workaround I listed in the first paragraph of the review. -On another note, the CPU allies are not nearly as responsive as in the original version. I am well versed in the keyboard shortcuts for commands (telling your allies to wait to attack, for example, or build a navy), and unfortunately, they're just not listening to me half of the time in-game. (UPDATE 12/8/2014: This can ALSO be fixed by using the game's original AI with the fix above.) -Some of the HD changes this version made aren't as good as the original. The cliffs look awkward and two dimensional, for one example, and prepare to relearn the resource bar (the food icon that used to be a steak is now an ear of corn, etc.). HOWEVER, you can download mods to change this back to the original if you are unable to get used to it. -Just one look at the community hub for this game will show you that the developers can't be bothered about the community's main concerns. Some frivilous questions/concerns are answered, but the main concerns such as the downgrading of the AI have been unanswered for months (I originally wrote this review in March 2014, and as of December 2014, this is still true).   Main Verdict: Age of Empires II is a must have for any RTS fan or gamer with an affection for medieval warfare and weaponry. While the HD version does have its setbacks in comparison to the original version, there are fixes to ensure you have the classic AoE II experience. Age of Empires II HD is a good alternative to the original game for those gamers who do not have a physical copy or have issues running it. Age of Empires II is a solid 10/10, while Age of Empires II HD earns a 9/10 because it has the fix available. If it did not or they were to take the option away in the future, this score would need to be downgraded to a 3/10."
What can I say that no one already said about that game?  I bought it for the nostalgia and I haven't been disapointed. For me this is the mother of all Realtime-Strategy-Games and I will probably always come back to play a few rounds.  (Online-Multiplayer is kinda hard to get successfully into to).
"This game is fun, but everyone who plays it is a ♥♥♥♥, especially if you have a low rank because you just started/haven't played in a while."
"Die you disgusting blue man!!!  *wololooo*  oh hey, my shirt just turned blue. :D"
10/10 would crash again.
"I love this game, and so should you."
"I really love it. It brings back my childhood, so many memories. I live in Asia, so lag, ping so high. I cant play well. But nothing is impossible, I'm still playing AOE 2. I hope Microsoft update server and Asian can play a good game!."

"One of my favorite video games of all time, and now compatible with modern operating systems and with Steam multiplayer support! Fantastic!  A solid RTS."
"AOE2 is one of the kings of Real Time Strategy. A game with knights on horseback, the building of an empire, and the premise of total conquest by any means necessary. A game that dispenses with the idea of morality, and breeds competition through complete annihilation.  AOE2's reputation speaks for itself. Prior to this re-release it was still immensly popular online in Europe. While I do wish Microsoft re-released AOE1 first, as I played that game more frequently. AOE 2 is still an incredible RTS, especially with the vast amount of user created content for it. This re-release also runs in higher resolutions and comes with the Conquerer's expansion pack.  Really when you can find it for a good price I cannot recommend this game more. RTS games are few and far between, and this game truly does give titans like Starcraft a run for it's money."
"I own and love the original release of the game, with that said DO NOT BUY THIS HD VERSION, unless you love lag, some of the most unresponsive and dumb AI you can find and oh yeah! let’s not forget about the constant multiplayer crashes were you are mid game already crushing your opponents or having your a.. whip, and the game decides to kick you out and post a message about how servers are full and it can’t connect back, without saving the game or being able to resume that match…. DON’T BUY THIS VERSION OF THE GAME, unless you want some rage moments in your day."
"Network gameplay, which is the reason I and my friends bought this game sucks so much that its basically unusable, even small 3v3 first 20 mins is unplayable, way worse than original AoE"
"Beautiful, beautiful &lt;3  Enough can not be said about Age of Empires, but everyone who had their share of experience with this franchise will know. Never played the game, you say? Well then, don't wait for anything, buy it!  Been playing AoE2 since like 2000 and it's still brilliant. The HD edition brought much refreshment for the game, with better graphics, native HD resolution and multi display support. What's the kickass for a casual player though, is the Multiplayer and Steam Workshop. Multiplayer is now ran through Steam, which eliminates all the trouble we've had since ES shut down.  If you're deciding on buying, i can't do better than encourage you and wish you good luck in the next hundreds of hours of wonderful and for some of you nostalgic gameplay."
"Such a classic, still one of the best games ever made !"
"HD title is misleading. Graphics are very poor, the game just supports larger resolutions."
one of my favorite games ever  11/10 would wololo again  really an all time classic
"Age of Empires II HD is a remake of the original Age of Empires II (because number 3 was god awful) in this intense base building game you enjoy a peaceful expansion against easy AI and the but utterly crushed by a moderate difficulty AI. Then, after hours and hours of slogging through games maybe you'll take on a super hard AI, maybe. As well as that you can enjoy one of this game's million campaigns, because doing three of four wasn't enough. But then again, doesn't everyone want to play as Vlad the Impaler and fight Romanian Tribesmen.  But, it is the multiplayer that really kicks the ♥♥♥♥ bucket. If perhaps you're just looking for a nice, easy game full of teamwork and such then you'll be horribly disappointed. Watch as your Levy Pikemen are utterly slaughtered by hoards of Paladins, scream in terror as your walls are torn down by Vikings, or just scream with a hint of insanity as your men are turned against by men in dresses with sticks.  If you happen to be the guy with the Paladins, the Vikings or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Priests, well done!"
You dont like this game?  Monk: Wolololo!  Now you like this game.  
Highly recommended for fans! Best RTS ever 5/5 ★★★★★
The game play is AWESOME :D but the Server is not good :(
Now my PC isn't the best by far but with this game I can run this in the highest quality and lag free whereas other games even when it's windowed and on the lowest quality graphics I still lag like crazy.  I'd without a doubt recommend this game to everyone who see's this comment yet doesn't own the game!!
One of the best Games ever!
One of the best strategy games since 1999.
"This.  This is a game you need.  How do I even begin to recommend this? Do I tell you it's the best single-player RTS of all time? That, when combining campaign and skirmish, it's got some of the best single-player value for the money ever? That it's just... it's a reminder of the great games you used to play as a kid? That this will be one of the five best games you ever have in your Steam collection? That the mod scene for the game's exploding? That the new expansion pack, The Forgotten, and tweaks to the core have made it a better game than ever before?  This is Age of Empires II. It was the greatest RTS of all time, at least as far as single-player games go. And now, with the HD rerelease, it's even better.  Only minor gripe, campaign feels a bit unbalanced. Really, really brutal. But, then, I'm not very good at the multitasking required to be the best at RTSes. I've cheated in a couple of missions, to avoid being completely overrun. But that's just me. I suck. It's a great game, with great value for the money.  If you buy this, you'll find that your money and time were well spent, and honestly, what more could you want out of a game?  What are you waiting for? Start the game already!"
"I bought this game because I enjoted the Original game as a kid, it's nice having this on steam for old time sakes.  The game isn't that much different from the orginal, though personally i feel it is a little laggy at times, but maybe that is due to the increased unit size.  I just bought 'The Forgotten Expansion'.   I must say The DLC to this game 'The Forgotten Expansion' feels more like a mod that I have payed for rather then a real expanshion, when startiing a mission there is no voice audo like the original games, just simply text. I would recomend skipping the add-on, and just downloading something simmilar from the steam workshop."
"Update 20 Nov.  This game is simply not a final product despite being years after initial release. Today single player hung near end of game, at least whole computer didnt crash this time.  Even little things like user/player name doesnt show on start screen. Choose a new player but when creating game paramters in standard game the selected user name doesnt show. A small thing but maybe indicative of lack of polish this game lacks.   Why do I still play? I didnt buy this for myself, bought to player with others but sadly cannot. All I really want is what I thought I paid for ... a functional game.  Dont see how this game got so many positive reviews.  **************************************************************************************************** Update 18 Nov  Single player, game crashed in midplay..... screen black this time not BSOD, but must remove power wait and reboot, 3rd reboot and I got back up. Windows says error, but no restore.  When will it crash again? Computer didnt start crashing until installed this app, and only crashes during or immediately after an in game crash and reboot.  ****************************************************************************************************************** Update 17 Nov 2015 After Hotfix tried multiplayer a bit better but still laggy..... but then in midplay (no other apps running) BSOD Windows (Blue Screen of Death) couldnt restart computer tried several times, unplug monitor and computer, now Windows want to restore to restore point.  Modified my review here a minute later BSOD again restart and another BSOD this is ridiculous! Had to retype this review!   Use at own risk! No LAN version either, must use via internet booooooo!   ********************************************************************************************************************    Loved the old version, but for my capable machine, even running with nothing loaded from the workshop it crashes.  Appears to be hardware/system dependant, a survey would be interesting, but on my Win32, Phenom 2 X4 965 and Nvidia 9600GT, the multiplayer is unplayable, 1-2 second delays after issuing commands.  I loved the old version, looks like I have to continue using the old version even tho I have 2 copies of the new HD and its extended content; the Forgotten....... irritating.  Difficult to assess these reviews it terms of how well the product will perform for you.....   Overall: the game concept is great  the execution good to unplayable depending on your system."
It's that you bought 10 ♥♥♥♥ing year ago to top it all off they charge for a mod that used to be free the game is glitchy and ♥♥♥♥ which is weird because I thought it was supposed to better Also no one ♥♥♥♥ing plays it seriously ♥♥♥♥ ms
"HD? I'm kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, I bought recently a MBP Retina Display, so I though it was a good idea to get Windows 8 and then AOE2HD cause the trailer announced the multiple displays support and since the name got a big HD on it I though (I was wrong) that my new display would take the best from it, but it doesn't, I couldn't even play cause everything on the games looks so small and even trying to low the resolution from windows (Cause there is no option inside the game to change reolution (WTF! I know)) can't help me cause the only thing that change from resolution are the annoying mouse pointer, so now I got a big hand covering my tinny workers, I really want my money back."
Badly missed chance to update the gameplay from AOE2. Poorly implemented 'HD' graphics and AI is worse than original. Still it's playable but can be annoying at times.
"The campaigns no longer work properly; the COMPUTER DOES NOT BUILD UNITS. The computer only uses the existing units, then sits there and does nothing for the rest of the game. I know for a fact that this was not the case in the original Age of Empires II, I put in my old CD and checked.   In addition the new campaigns in the 'Forgotten expansion' have NO VOICED NARRATION. The well-acted voiceovers at the beginning and ends of campaigns are what made the old game so great. The new campaigns are text narration only."
"The FPS regularly sinks, on modern systems. For a 2000 game. I'll let that sink in.  The pathfinding appears to be more or just as broken as the originial title. The game is highly unstable.  The new effects they added are badly tacked on and look worse than what they replace. The cliffs look out of place, the flammes look like a slow detached blingee gif added on top the building, the farms and ressource icons look like crap.  Do not buy the expansions as they are not expansions, they are MODS. MODS that you PAY for. They were made by young high school/college modders (this is no joke) and scream amateurish for every content introduced. The material stands out from the original assets like a stain on a white napkin. The slav building set has a lower resolution than the rest of the game, looks unfinished and the colors are way off the game's general scheme. Most of the new units added were ripped from old mods or AoE2's original beta units.  The forgotten campaigns are a succession of very narrow corridors (A nightmare with the armies you control), on immense maps clogged with buildings and decorations. The modder who made them seems to be suffering from the same affliction as George Lucas which prevents the both of them from realizing when overdesigning is ''too much''. There is no voice acting obviously, thank god for that considering the walls of texts thrown at our faces were apparently written by someone struggling with the English language (of course they're also amateurish and cheesy beyond the simple vocabulary and spelling mistakes). The triggers can be downright tedious, like having to click back and forth between two characters just to trigger each lines of a pointlessly long dialogue, and are apparently so elobaborate they can cease working altogether.  Even small details like the new pictures for the civilizations in the history section, or especially the unit voices, stand out for their low quality. You are left to wonder if the material used for most of these voice recordings amounted to more than an in built laptop mic and the work outsourced to a random Peruvian, Hungarian, Russian, and Italian fan respectively. Considering this 'expansion' was made by amateurs in the first place, would that be surprising? (Read on how they were produced in the original 1999 game, it's amasing that they went their way to hire Mongolian throat singers for the Huns/Mongols voices).  The new expansion, AFRICAN KINGDOMS, suffers the same, just to a lesser extent. The content still stands out for its low quality. The new building set for Africans looks a bit better than the slav one, and they had the sense to give the Italian building set to the Portugese. The campaigns are still inferior to the original ones but not as bad as the Forgotten. Not as over designed, they have some very bad voice acting but at least there's less lines to read from (you can spot mic distortions which obviously indicate some sort of cheap USB mic in someone's bedroom was used, again). You often walk accross gigantic maps, tediously eliminating one small group of enemy after another. Age of Empires 2 is not Warcraft and was never meant to play like an adventure tactical game, especially not on amateurish maps.  And this is about all you can say about the HD edition. There is virtually no other content to review. On the plus side the new civilizations are somewhat balanced and play alright in multiplayer, some balance changes were introduced and are welcome for the competitive scene. Except there's virtually no HD competitive scene to speak of and the multiplayer is mostly dead.  If you like Age of Empires 2 I recommend you acquire the old versions and go play on Gameranger or Voobly who have a thriving multiplayer scene.   PS : If you're wondering about the Italian building set, they ripped it off from a very old mod, Rome at War. I don't even know if the original creators are aware that they are making a profit on their backs."
"A timeless classic, butchered by incompetence. You would imagine a re-release would warrant at least a stable release, but the game is anything but. Even two-player multiplayer games slow the game down to tectonic plate speed, with no patch or even a community fix in sight. It's highly likely that the game has been abandoned by Hidden Path, either out of indifference or ineptitude to fix the jarring problems with this 'HD Edition', which brings only stretched out user interface to the table, but offer less frames per second than the original '98 version of the game.  Saddens me to see the old classics dug out from their graves like this, and hocked off unfinished products bearing familiar titles to unwary consumers in hope for a quick buck."
"Idle villager button doesn't work after the release of African Kingdoms. It is the best joke on AoC ever!  Edit: I am aware the problem was fixed long ago. But the main problem of this game is having lots of issues like that and developers don't take them serious in long term.  #It doesn't run on some old PCs which can run old version of the game# I like this game very much and have always been a supporter of Cysion about this project. But I also have to admit that had lots of problems when trying to play instead of old AoEII. I insisted a friend to buy this game on Steam when it was just released. But the game didn't work on his PC. I know, this happens very rare but it didn't run on a computer which can run old version very well. So, you can't play this game with an old graphich card.  #FPS# FPS is lower than expected. I expected to play this game with Intel integrated graphics, but it's not fluent on high resolutions. Also, scroll system doesn't feel smooth like the old version, especially if FPS stays below 60s.  #Game balance# Adding new civilizations and units very good improvement, but as long as they don't break the game balance. But I think nobody doesn't play The Forgotten seriously or (some of them) still not aware of it. It is really impossible to stand Italians with a cavalry civilization (like Persians). Or Incas' unique unit is really worthless. When these changes considered seriously you can see the unbalanced points easily.  #Campaign videos (Narrated Stories)# I had really enjoyed while playing Age of Kings and Conquerors campaigns, expected same quality from Forgotten. Actually, scenerio designs very good, but why there is no narrated stories with a medieval soundtrack? This could be really done easily because texts are already implemented in the game. It seems they realised this lack and added to African Kingdoms, but I think Forgotten Empires also deserved that. To be honest, I was expecting that for a long time and it seems no chance for AoFE no longer.  Conlusion: I like this time and still supporting the project and spending money for it. But I also have to admit that when I compare the changes and lacks of it, the lacks seem more than improvements."
"After the Dev's got a screaming audiance spamming their forums how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the port of a ''HD'' version of a game that is about 10 years old actually is they decided to patch it. Now it can somewhat run like it's supposed to (Come on..it's made in '99, allowing it to run on every toaster)) However still is far from ''HD Edition'', unless you download some of the community made texture packs.  Put that aside it's still a shiny game from gameplay perspective!"
Simply -&gt; OMG!! OMG!!! OMFG!!!!!!!! IT'S FINALLY HEEEREEE!!!!
"Imagine eating a tablespoon of peanut butter (crunchy), now imagine something completely different with 7 players in a lobby all chanting 'wololo' to a rate faster than any CPU can process let alone for any singleton brain to fathom as it pounds and resounds in an ever increasing amplitude whilst complaining at the host for not having enough foresight to predict the map that would satisfy the vast majority of his peers' tasteless personalities as they type hastily with sweaty fingers and talk of merrier times when admins bent to their will and started the game in 10 seconds tops. Seiously, ♥♥♥♥ this game."
Just a classic with all the benefits that comes with steam. Need I say more?
Shape an empire how you want and wage battles that will define your experience. Still one of the best games after all this time.
"AOE II HD edition:   So many hours I once put in this game, unbelievable. It's even going to get worse (if you can call it 'worse') now I don't have to play with the low resolutions or ugly windows aero glitch. My friends and I bought it on steam and after apr. 50h of multiplayer games with them (and many more to come) I can say it's good to be back.   Altough there are a few flaws in the game (max 30 fps, lag, different hotykeys etc.) they do not lessen the value of the game for me. if you are a player just looking for fun moment with friends, this will certainly do the job! The custom scenario's are also fun to play, however most of them kind of neglect the beauty of the big rock-paper-scissor game AOE is intended to be.   For the Forgotten Expansion I can not say anything because I'm too busy playing the original campaigns and multiplayer.  Also, I wish there was some way to get them to play the first AOE with me...    And... START THE GAME ALREADY!"
"It was great in 1999, it is great now"
"Fun game reccomended, old but gold."
"Betrayed my friends, killed them all, made my ♥♥♥♥ feel big. Top game."
"Come on, it's AOE II HD!!!!  YOU REALLY NEED TO READ A REVIEW?  If you don't want to play it that much, buy it in respect. One of the best games ever."
"I loved AOE2 as a kid, and this certainly updates it fairly well. Though I do have one gripe; some of the difficulty settings. While I love RTS games, I suck at them. I can generally win easily on the lowest difficulty setting since the opponent doesn't do anything. I played a game where I was in Standard mode, and also won that with relative ease. I went to the next difficulty up again, and somehow wound up getting my ♥♥♥ kicked. A difficulty between the two would be good, that would hit a sweet spot where it's challenging without being frustrating.   Or maybe these are the ramblings of an idiot who took the 'review game' box to mean 'suggest ♥♥♥♥ that nobody else wants'."
Such a bad game I would not personally ever recommen- *wololo*  gaem2gud heff tu sed peepol tu deth ef haet
is gud gema unless u heff frnd tht rektacngles u thn is no gud cos protox777 is fegit tht has no frnesd cos he is no fun
"Best RTS on the market, i played the orginal game about 8 years ago and the HD edition makes everything better. Highly recommended!"
"i remember playing this game when i was 10... and then the disc broke... so i was really happy it was here.   i loved it then... and i love it now... heck, this game may be old... but its still a really great game."
"Resurrected an old game and its still an owning factor in strategy based games. The last thing to do is to fix all the remaining bugs and keep the current wave of adding more stuff into it and it looks like that developers are really working on those areas.  Good job, keep it up."
A classic game which must be played by people experienced and new to RTS games. Definitely one of the best games I have ever played.
This game is as fun as it was when I played 15 years ago. Very pleased with my purchase.
"This game never gets old! Still an amazingly fun game to play now, especially with friends. Definitely not a slow paced strategy game - you have to always keep track of resources and opponents in real time, and make the right decisions on the fly - something I can't do. Don't forget to spam some voice commands too! 30"
It's kind of like dust II but different
Game is so op
"OMG this game is my CHILD HOOD in a nutshell! Now with improved graphics, Time to spend HOURS like I use to building up EMPIRES and crushing any enemies that stand before me!"
"THE DEFINITIVE RTS GAME.  One of the rare gems that truly encompasses everything there is to love in a game genre. See Skyrim for Sandbox RPGs, Mario Bros 3 for platformers, etc. I won't go into detail explaining the gameplay, but with 20+ civilizations to play with and against, you will never run out of combinations.   GRAPHICS/MUSIC  The music is catchy and will get stuck in your head quickly. Graphically, it's not necessarily 'HD'. Just looks sharper and more refined thatn the base game. Overall, pretty good, and you can easily tell what things are, make distinctions between teams, and identify PRECIOUS STONE HOLY CRAP WHY IS THERE NO STONE WHEN I NEED IT  STORY  The story mode is played out in single-player 'scenarios' that document real events in world history. It's a very cool concept, but isn't as great as the multiplayer.   MULTIPLAYER  This is where the game truly shines. Nothing beats getting a few buds together and playing Last Man Standing for ages. Honestly, it can't be put into words, you have to experience it for yourself.  OVERALL  GRAPHICS/MUSIC: 8  STORY: 8  MULTIPLYER: 10  In conclusion, it's easily the best RTS I've ever played. I'm now realizing this was a REALLY half-♥♥♥♥♥ review that I might redo later. "
"It's exactly as i remember it, just better. I still own the original disc but i'm happy i bought this version. I'm especially happy that this isn't just another cheesy 'remasteredsuperHDeditionwithcoolnewsoundfxandnewAIandsupernewrevolutionaryinterface.... - editon' and just plain sucks compared to the original game.

You can play as a monkey boy who murders kings 10/10 would murder people with a monkey again

"So you came back to your childhood game..  You're wondering if you would like this game again..  This game had me addicted like no other. New civilisations to take advantage of,  Making your own town.. making your own special soldiers.. using them against the enemy.  Sure. WHY NOT?  JK.  This game hmm.......... Yeah, havent played much but yeah, its cool I suppose. ;-)  Dont hesitate. It's cheap. It's fun.  Bring back your childhood !!"
This game is as fun as it was when I played 15 years ago. Very pleased with my purchase.
This game is one of those games that never get boring. It is a perfect combiantion of skill and intelligence. I just love it.
Hard core super -truper mega awsome game. Realy good remake. Problem is that they do not fix population problems... you cant play with higher then 200 pop limit becouse game will extremly lagg.  Multiplayer is fun also but too much crashes.
You can play as a monkey boy who murders kings 10/10 would murder people with a monkey again
Revisisiting your childhood is a simple click away. Then again I don't rememeber being so mercilessly brutalised on multiplayer.   Wolololo/5
30/30 Would Wololo again.
Age of Empires 2 is a fantastic game its allows you many hous of exciting and varying battles. Its loads of fun in both singleplayer and especially multiplayer there are plenty of stratagies and each game plays out differently meaning the game has lots of replayability. Its truly a classic and is well worth buying if you like strategy games
Toby buy it ♥♥♥
Game is so op
It's kind of like dust II but different
"Nostalgic... Played this game as a kid, even better now remastered a online!"
Is gud. i play 48 hours every day. WOLOLO! U R NOW MY COLOUR
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with an HD remake filled to the brim with content. With eight campaigns, a robust multiplayer, Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price of admission."
"Despite what certain nostaglia infected customers say, this game is entirely faithful to the original in the best of ways. A truly classic RTS, this game is easy to learn and difficult to master.  Pros: -Timeless gameplay -A large amount of factions (Even more with continued DLC) -True to the original -Workshop friendly!  Cons: -Occasional multiplayer connectivity issues  Overall:  Buy. Many hours of fun to be had. Better with friends!"
"As far as my opinion concerned, I can't see any other game more deserving of the 'Test Of Time' award."
"I'm really glad someone brought this classic back to life. I had so many hours of fun with it back in the day. Should you have played the original and would still like to get a taste of it once again, you'll be happy to know that they almost entirely left the game as it was back in the day, only this time with mod support, support for modern machines, and Steamworks integration for multiplayer! Even to this day this classic holds its own and I think you will find a lot of enjoyment out of it even now."
"I've had played this game since childhood and I used to enjoy playing it all the night long with no stopping. After like 8 years, I felt like playing it again, thus I bought it on Steam and I'm now enjoying it once again. The graphics aren't that perfect, nor are there that many features but howsoever it's still an interesting game that's worth buying. Cheers."
best use of a farm animal ever
"A PC gaming classic, and an all around great RTS. Fun to play and easy to get into, but hard to master.   On a side-note, if you've played Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, its pretty much the same game and vice-versa."
"One of the finest RTS games ever made. The countless hours I have poured into the original 1999 classic is beyond measure. WIth a ton of civilizations to choose from with there own strenghs and weaknesses, there always a way to turn a game around. With the new version's graphical updates and extra options its a fresh revamp for the classic game. I Highly recommend this game to any RTS fan.  Final Score 90/100"
"I just had to vote this game for the 'Test of Time' award, I grew up loving this game and still love it to this day. This game was amazing for its time and is still on par with new games today. It truely has stood the test of time. 10/10 would recommend."

"Very fun game to play, it's almost identical to the original AoE II, but that's just what i wanted."
"i would suggest the game only if ur planing to buy it because you played it many years ago and you want to relive the game, but if you never touched it, i wouldn't recommend"
Hours and hours and hours and hours of fun.
It's like maplestory...but worse!
"You can convert elephant at your side. Buy It Now  Now the review -  + Lot of civilization Lot of playstyles,maps,mods .... Steam Workshop Fun You can learn form AOE stuff to another RTS games  Great Gameplay And manny manny more   -/+ Nothing  - Nothing  Verdict: Must own my favorite RTS game 10/10"
The same game you played as a kid in higher resolution. Not sure why you're even debating this. Buy it now!
"It's Age of Empires. In HD. If you enjoy RTS games even a little, you want this game. If you haven't already played this game, you should play this game. If you enjoy the concept of castles, you should buy this game.  The game is a standard medieval RTS game, in that it was the defining factor back in 1999 as to what they would become. It is extremely balanced after years of playing it and refining it. The HD version enhances the game by offering wide screen options, newer hardware/OS support, steam integration, and new age balance changes. Age of Empires II HD has received nothing but betterment on top of its amazing predecessor, the classic many grew up with and even more played.   Age of Empires II HD and the new expansion, 14 years after the release of the game, are both must haves for any gaming collection. 10/10"
Best Strategy game ever :) recomended to people who loves strategy
The same game you played as a kid in higher resolution. Not sure why you're even debating this. Buy it now!
" Welcome everyone, back to Age of Empires II.  That one game from everyone's childhood that is the cause of mass nostalgia is now on steam and HD.  Original Release Date:  September 30, 1999  Steam Release Date:  April 9, 2013   As nearly everyone else in the reviews, I also played this in my childhood. This was probably my second or third game (after AOE I of course) and I can easily recall wololo'ing enemies to my command, only using the cavalry because they looked neato and stupidly raiding enemy AI prematurely without much of a chance. Age of Empires was a brilliant part of my gaming childhood and might just be what pushed my 5-6 year old self to continue to do what I love up to today, gaming.  Age of Empires II is a RTS (Real-Time Strategy). The focus of the game is to gather resources such as wood, food, gold and stone to create your most ideal kingdom that fits whatever scenario you are in/come across. You use your loyal villagers to create buildings based around certain ages you can evolve through. These ages consist of the  Dark Age ,  Feudal Age ,  Castle Age  and  Imperial Age . As you move forward throught the ages, you advance in technology and become able to construct better buildings and units all with the intention of surpassing your opponent in economy and militia.  The game offers an easy and understandable tutorial to people who are new to the scene of RTS games while still maintaining a learning curve of difficulty perfect for more advanced players. Lower difficulties aren't simply a walk in the park where the AI immediately gives up. It still provides a challenge suitable for the newer people to the game.    The Yays!"
This is an AWESOME game!!! I've played for 150 hours and ther's for shure 150 more to come. One of the reasons I like this game so much is that you never can finish it or beat it completly (well you CAN play ALL the campaigns). You can always set the difficulty up and there's always something new to learn. This is probably the game of my childhood (after the Sly Cooper games on PS2) There's also ALOT of history in the game wich can even help you with school work. It's alot better than AoE 3 and I don't really recomend that game so much.   AoE 2 is the best Age of Empires game and I really enjoy it. 10/10  
my childhood is back in HD !!!!!!!!!!!!

This bring back a lot of old and fun memories
"I first played the demo of Age of Empire II when I was six. I remember how thrilled I was fighting the Britons side by side with William Wallace; I have played this campaign again and again. How many times did I destroy that castle in The Battle of Falkirk? I couldn't tell. And I didn't even try the full version yet. It's not a surprise my parents later gave it to me for my birthday! I finished every campaign multiple times, fought against my friends or side by side with them. Even when I spend months, even some years, without playing it, the music comes back to me once in a while. I was in love with that game.  It is saddening how the new development team made me hate it.  This HD version is like raisin cookies you mistook for chocolate ones. And I will tell you right away why it is so dream shattering: lag. Huge ugly lag which tears all the fun from this game.  I have a decent computer which runs many other games with high graphics. But this game lags when there are more than a few hundred units on the map. Sometimes it even freezes for a whole second, it's not just low fps. I believe it's more than a graphic issue, there is a memory leak somewhere and nobody from the community found a way to fix it. It is a known issue, search 'AoE lag' and you will find dozens of bug reports, but the development team doesn't seem to care; it has been a long time according to what I read and they prefer to release DLCs than to address a monstrous bug in the core of this game.  Do not buy it; go back to the original version. That's what I will do."

If you don't enjoy this then I'm afraid we can't be friends.  EDIT: When will they make it so the AI doesn't build 500 boats that completely ♥♥♥♥ my docks? Can't move in the water without getting bombarded by enemy boats.  EDIT (2): Original AI is back. Panic over.
"Note: This review has been updated.  The best in depth RTS ever made. No game can every come close to the replayability of this game. With the release on steam we get to see an all time favorite get new development and features. Two official expansions have been added since AoC was released in the year 2000.   A notable feature that the HD edition brings is an integrated lobby system. Users with any combination of the standard HD edition or expansions/DLC can play with each other and see each others lobbies. As a former player of Age of Empires 3 I hated seeing the community spit up into vanilla, The War Chiefs, and the Asian Dynasties.  I've put 1000 hours into the game so far and still enjoy it. The multiplayer experience is the heart of the replayability. You will experience more lag than older versions of the game due to the visual engine being updated with directx 9.0c. It was originally made with version 5 &amp; 6. The minus is the peer to peer connections vs a client server model. The plus is there is no cost to maintain it and you'll see more dollars free for development rather than paying for servers. I've found that playing with players from a region close to you makes for a pretty nice running match.  Players from Europe with good connections+good PC's can also be played with a tolerable amount of delay. Cross continent play with poor connections or older PC's makes the game hard to play. Find games with 200 or less ping and you'll be sweet!  Single player runs very good with unlocked FPS and is very responsive. It makes campaigns very enjoyable, especially when you start with limited armies and need to spend more time microing your units. The classic age of kings and conquers campaigns are always great, forgotten empires campaigns lack a little bit of the classic feel. They don't' have voice acting and play very modular like. The feel is you are playing a well crafted scenario vs a retail campaign. The newest expansion African Kingdoms brings back some of the old magic with voice acting and fluid campaigns. I highly recommend it. I have completed all the campaigns so that's my experience with them.   I give the game overall 8/10 with 10/10 a possibility. It would need to make better gains in multiplayer to earn that perfect rating. If you consider $/hour played, this game is the best value you can find even at full price."
"I played most of my childhood away in this game. Probably 10,000 + hours lol. This game is amazing!"
"Everything that was good about the original is back but with better optimization for our more modern PC's, achievements, and of course interesting DLC content.   So many HD remakes are just cash grabs that offer no bonus other than 'no disc required' this actually feels worth the price.   Highly recommended."
"Hoppin on this mad nostalgia train with the mates has been a blast. The new forgotten expansion adds a bunch of fun new features/civs. Plus the AI redux makes the game a lot better in my opinion, 10/10 would buy"
So far the best real time strategy game. This is like the Last Samurai of all the classic games on PC.
"Hoppin on this mad nostalgia train with the mates has been a blast. The new forgotten expansion adds a bunch of fun new features/civs. Plus the AI redux makes the game a lot better in my opinion, 10/10 would buy"
"Just like the original game! Still super fun. Seriously, go watch some videos on it and then fall in love with it."
Not worth the purchase unless you are nostagic about the game. It is an amazing game and runs well on new and old machines alike (caveat: I've only played single-player and have heard about multiplayer lag issues) but it really shows its age and the HD enhancements really aren't that impressive.   One big complaint of mine is that the screen is zoomed at a fixed level (I have tiny interface widgets). This was fine 10 years ago when screen sizes were pretty similar but it just doesn't work well with bigger monitors. Apparently when they called it HD edition they really meant 'works on HD monitors and newer processors without crashing' not 'graphics and interface adjusted and imrpoved for modern gamers'.

"Please note that I'v been playing this game for as long as I can remember.  Age of empires 2 is the grandfather of RTS games, and i'v been playing since I was a baby, Litteraly, This was one of my first games.  If you want a nostalgia trip then by all means, Buy this game now, It's great. If you've never played this game before or you are new to RTS games, I advice getting, It's a great intro the RTS genre.  Pros: - MultiPlayer, It's awesome, It's fun, it's fast and its a lot better than the original. -Replay ability -Great intro into RTS games -Workshop Cons: -Lag, It can get a bit laggy towards end game, Especially if you get mods which up the unit cap -Multi Player community, In my experiance the online community surrounding AoE2 HD can be a little hostile to new players.  In all, AoE 2 HD is a great buy, It's worth picking up, Even if its not on sale, Which it often is!  The game comes with the conquerors DLC which makes the price even more worth it. The game also has 'The Forgotten' DLC which is on sale right now."
The game that started the strategy genre
"This game was one of my childhood favourites, and inspired my interest in history, especially history surrounding the nomadic empires of Atilla and Genghis. The gameplay is fairly standard when it comes to RTS gameplay, you start with your Town Hall and a few workers and micromanage said workers untill you've got a town large enough to build a sufficient army to take on your foes.  Personally I never got very invested in the multiplayer, which is why I'm glad to say the singleplayer is very extensive with campaigns surrounding certain wars that were fought in times long past, for instance the rise of the mongol empire, and the events that unfolded when spaniards first set foot on aztec lands. I wouldn't say the game is 100% historically accurate, but the campaigns are definitely based around real events.  Beyond that, all and all I think it's a fun game, the HD edition doesn't add to much beyond making everything look a bit smaller, but nothing too upsetting, atleast it lets me play Age of Empires 2 again, a game I'd gladly pay for to relive.  Word of warning though, I have come across a lot of issues with the expansion 'The Forgotten', and as it was based around a mod for the original game, a lot of the AI feels clunkier. (The AI will spawn tons of units in their fortress and the campaigns can feel more like a grind than usual), and the pathing is sometimes difficult to manage. There's also the issue of invisible walls in favour of pacing, which all comes down to your personal preference.  All in all I love the original game, and due to that I can bare The Forgotten's campaigns, but if you're trying this for the first time I'd recommend starting off with the game without the dlc."
"Despite its graphical errors and unexplained strain on both your gpu and cpu, this HD remake strikes close to my heart and is a deffinent 'must buy' for any old Age of Empires player. If not for the re-texturing, the Steam workshop which provides hours of endless entertainment with one of my favorite strategy games of all time. Only downside is the fact that ofc is not a new game, with little to no new content  from the developers side   7/10"
10/10*
"This game is an awesome classic. When I saw it being remasterized into a HD version I couldn't lose the opportunity to revive those campaigns and this marvelous game. And I couldn't be any less satisfied, this game still entertains me and has not lost any of its magic touch. Such masterpiece should never be forgotten in the sands of time, that said, if you remember playing this game in the olde days, just buy it-"
i've spent too much time playing this game all i can say is: BOOM BOOM INTO GOLDEN MINES BOOM INTO RANDOM FOREST BOOM MAN JUST BOOM LIKE *boom* BUT WITH YOUR TC AND VILLAGERS BOOM BOOM GO PRACTICE SOME BOOM RIGHT THE ♥♥♥♥ NOW
"Used to play this game everyday at work with my colleagues.  But now with the latest patch and expansion it's literally impossible to play it even on LAN. The expansion and patch were released 4-5 November. It's mid december now and we can't restore MP games or when you are able to restore them, no one can join your lobby. I paid extra money for the expansion and what seems that I've bought is a broken version of a once wonderful game. Over a month time to fix the issues and so far barely anything has been fixed.  Never have I seen such abysmal support from a development team. Such a shame because this is one of the PC all time classics."
alot of fun when u play against PrideofNi
"One of the best RTS games ever made alongside Command and Conquer. This remake of the game in HD is excellent. I've been playing AOE since i was a kid, and was able to introduce some of my friends to the game via the HD edition. It's an excellent multiplayer game. Buy it."
I love this game. It takes age of empires 2 and guess what it makes it High definition. I can't stand the hdness of this game. I remember the older Unhd version of Age of Empires II. This changes it completely comple different playstyles and maps. I wuv this game with all my little tiny heart.
"Cannot join any multiplayer games as you get kicked due to low level, can't get level, because you can't play mulitplayer games."
Every single time i entered a multplayer game it crashed nearly immediately. Don't know if i was the only one who had this issue but i wouldn't suggest buying it if it still doesnt work over a decade after release... Steam refund's great though.
"10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ me over again and again, and again."
Have to leave a No as the game is unplayable with my friends due to low frame rates. Pitty because the exansion does look promising.
"I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with this game' but it sucks. I used to play all the time with no trouble, now the frame rete is choppy as hell and it glitches. Way to go with improvements ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"
Doesn't run half the time
"The base game has been completely broken since November. My list of critical bugs:  * If a farm is 'targeted' by an enemy it cannot be worked, no matter if it is actually attacked or not. This can be exploited as a denial of service type attack.  * Gates don't actually stop any units, even enemies. Any unit can walk straight through a locked and closed gate, into your base. Trade carts end up on the outside of a wall, and the enemy army end up inside. Highly irritating.  * Multiplayer saves cannot be restored. I understand they are aware of this, it wouldn't be such a problem if the game didn't crash in the middle of a match so easily (for no reason).  * The map generation scripts for several maps are still 'missing' so only a small set of scenarios are actually playable.  * AI units just stand in front of walls and do nothing while they are slaughtered. While amusing, this does take the fight out of the game somewhat.  * Pathfinding in general is horrendous. Any group of units larger than 10, especially slow moving units for some reason always take the longest possible path and then get nearly to the goal and turn round and go back again. I don't know if there is some sort of timeout and slow units hit this and they are forced to 'recalculate' their path, but its very annoying.  Apparently the developers are 'aware' of most of these issues, howver because they are hell-bent on releasing oodles of DLC these have been forgotten for months with no indication at all of when they will be addressed. I would't mind if there was any signs of life from the developers themselves.  Suggestions for the developers:  * Unpin the countless 'patch threads' in the forum that are several years old and completely irrelevant. Keep the most recent patch thread in place so people can easily find it. Pin a thread which indicates which bugs you are aware of and some indication of priority or timeline. I'm sure (or I hope) you have an internal bug tracker, it wouldn't be too much to ask that we can get some indication of whether these issues are being fixed at all.  I really want this to be a positive review, but until these blatant issues are fixed I couldn't possibly recommend this game."
"Used to play this game for hoooours when i was a kid - its now in HD! tho i didnt notice anything new about it. Anyways, this game is awesome and its worth every euro you pay for it. I got it for free by my friend so trololol (i love him) I cant play this without cheats im so noob :D 10/10 !!!"
"What they did with the HD edition is great. It's a simple refresh to a timeless classic. There is not much room for improvement on such a well crafted masterpiece, the higher resolution support is really all this game needed, and I look at the rest of the improvements as added bonuses. These negative reviewers are insane! Game is worth every penny."

"I love AOE2. I grew up playing this game, and when I finally had the chance to buy it on steam I ran for it. I played it quite a bit, but then in November of 2015 the newest DLC broke the game.   I have not purchased any of the DLC, but with the latest patches, the AI no longer works AT ALL.   The AI will have 25-50 units stand around at their base and do nothing. Military units and civilians. If you are attacking an AI at their base, those military units will stand next to a settlement or castle and not move, not even defend. WTF?   The game is unfortunately broken. Single player is dead. AI mode is dead. Stay far away from this game, the developers have had 3 months to fix these GAME BREAKING BUGS, and have not.   R.I.P. AOE2"
"I gave up pooping for this game  10/10  On a serious note, this game is a whole load of fun and you should buy it if you want a great strategy game, it's has a huge amount of potential hours to spend on it, just look at my play time. You'll probably get addicted to it like me."
"A truly great HD remaster of one of the best rts games in existence. Everything that made this game so great is here, just better.   Anyone who played it back in 1999, knows how easy it is to get sucked into this game. And this re-release is no different.  It didn't take long, until I was spellbound once again. The gameplay is as intriguing as ever, and the music has aged well and perfectly fits the mood. Even the graphics still look great. The textures might not be as clean and sharp, but it's hard to miss the love and detail, that went into every pixel when played in HD.   Achievements, Leaderboards, Matchmaking and Cloud support are a welcome addition together with the visual upgrade. The game even supports user created content over Steam Workshop.   The only complaint I have, is the main menu. I personally would have liked to see a bit of an overhaul, but it's nothing serious.   I highly recommend this game to anyone who played the original or any rts lover who has not done so. Go, buy now!!!!"
"No LAN, no LAN, no LAN, lot of lag during multiplayer games, it's unplayable. A waste of money, don't buy it and use the original... it's still better!  0/10, bad idea Steam. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥."
"The original was one of my favorite game ... and I think this one could be too if it wasn't for the resolution thing. Seriously who in this day and age releases a game with almost no graphic settings. Are we such dummies that we can't choose what resolution we want ? And don't give me the : change your settings of your desktop, you can find mod for it. Thing is I can't choose my settings and for that this game deserves a bad review. I should not have to spend almost 3 hours to play with correct settings."
"This game is virtually unplayable with a high resolution computer. Even adjusting the resolution fails to make the absolutely tiny menus readable. Complete failure by the lazy developers. This is NOT an 'HD' version of this game, the higher your resolution the worse experiance you are going to have. Totally and completely disapointed here..."
"Deal-breaker issues as far as I'm concerned: - Can't change resolution. You get the original pixel graphics 1:1 on your screen, everything is super tiny. - Frame rate issues. On a Core i7+Radeon 7900 series card this is inexcusable considering that the original ran well on a 486.  Requested a refund and I'm off to look for my original discs."
The Multiplayer lags more than a firefight in a console game
"this game has perma 1sec delay, everythign laggs, no support, DONT BUY PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥"
"This game has so much nostalgic value! For me it still holds up, a true classic.  Really satisfying, awesome ingame music, awesome unit sounds, just awesome.  Turtle up, gear up SLAUGHTER!"
My favorite RTS game. Nor more details like Civilizations neither too basic like Red Alert. It's just perfect for me amazingly both of gameplay and histories.  I strongly recommend this game for RTS beginners.
"As a fan of AOE, AOE 2 and The Conquerors I was very disappointed with this installment. The game shows promise, has new units, techs and civilizations and anyone can appreciate the painstaking beautiful detail with which some scenarios are designed. But somewhere in that drive to create, the creators got carried away. Very carried away.  Some scenarios are almost unplayable with how difficult they are. The creators seem to have gone trigger happy with creating HUGE enemy armies and are obviously obsessed with the 'big battle'. This amateurish approach is something you'd expect from a beginner creator who wants to fill the screen with as many units as possible - not a serious creator.   You'll get huge hordes of units massacring each other, armies wasted against walls and almost impregnable cities with extremely tough AI (even at the easiest difficulty levels), impregnable cities with upwards of 10 castles, endless 'Fire Towers' and seemingly endless resources and ability to regenerate endless units. Challenging is fun, but this is just... yeah. Not worth it.   The original games were charming and made you feel immersed. Sadly, the expansion's difficulty is its biggest downside. It's hard to get immersed when you feel like you are fighting an almost artificially impossible scenario every single time you play.   Would not recommend."
"AOE 2 is such a great game. when it was release on pc many years ago around 2000, it ran smoothly the campaign was great and IMO it's one of the best stratergy games ever made. Coming on to the HD remake, running an i7-4790k 16gb ram and a gtx970, in single player against AI the game just struggles to reach 10fps 15mins in. i've oftern had games where it crahses for no aparent reason. The suprising thing is, the game doen't even use a quarter of the processing power/ram staying at around 20% and max 1gb. this has been a great game ruined by the developers lack of interest to fix it. Why would the developers release new PAID DLC instead of fixing the game first? This HD remake would be amazing if only the bugs were fixed. I can understand why there are so many positive reviews, the gameplay is great when it doesn't bug out.   Ah well yet another game ruined by the developers. Microsoft please bring back ensemble."
After updating to the newest patch this game has become unplayable. The framerate is slow in any game mode.
My childhood pretty much summed up...
"Just as good as I remembered. Some bugs here and there, but overall, good"

"Played this a lot back in the day with little problem, but now it's a broken mess and with the new DLC it's impossible to game with a friend without the game ending from out of sync issue."
Awesome game. Been playing forever and never gets old. Team battle against moderate difficulty is impossible though
"I loved playing AoE2 back in the day huge fan of AoE in general and I was really excited thanks to the positive reviews.   However, right now I can't reccomend it to anyone as it's literally unplayable with current patch.  As of weekend sale purchase the game suffers from massive critical bugs leading to mp desync, discos, huge framerate lag, as well as poor latency since they never upgraded the netcode for a 15yo game. How could they not have even tested this once, issues are immediately apparent in first 5s of scenario or skirmish play (even single player!). Hopefully it's fixed soon due to the massive outcry."
get a friend or something and touch weiners
I'm a big fan of age of empires... but this version is buggy. game crashes while loading to play.
The title is misleading it is just the same age of empires 2 with higher screen resolution which means you only zoom out and see units like tiny pixels
"A broken mess, in one sentance.  Currently playing patch 4.6, but the game is full of bugs like AI doing nothing when you load a savegame in campaign, terrible stuttering for no reason, keys not working sometimes and so on. I cannot play Dracula campaign mission 4 because the AI stops doing anything when I load the game. I read that some issues reported years ago were never fixed.  Terrible pathfinding, and overall terrible Forgotten Campaigns, badly scripted, with broken triggers.  This is a disservice to the original game I enjoyed very much, to be honest. :-(  You are better off playing the original game."
"EDIT: Fixed in the latest patch! Hurrah for lan again!  Original review:   I really liked the original.  I really liked this when it was re-released.  But the latest patch/expansion has totally fried the network play.  So now after buying the game twice, and the Forgotten expansion twice, I can no longer run a multi game with my GF, even though we're sitting in the same room.  Guess we're back to boardgames at the kitchen table."

"AOE:II now with worse performance, poorly balanced factions, overpriced DLC and bugs out the ♥♥♥♥.  Be warned that games with more than one person playing the same player slot no longer work."
-Played online -Lost -Team mates want me to kill myself  A very fun experience  10/10
"3 years later, multiplayer is still broken."
"The recent update has broken the game. No longer do buttons respond instantly, they lag in response, due to the revised game program. The game has been rewritten and just doesn't seem right. It is apparent that one of the prime goals of the update is to reduce demand on their servers, even though the original game was written for dialup internet. The game lobby is laggy, games take minutes to start, if they do start at all. With the lagginess of the interface, it is difficult to double click a unit and select all visible units, since the delay in click response makes double clicking on a moving unit impossible.  I loved this game, probably the best computer game ever made, but with this update it is time to stop playing it. Perhaps I'll go back to the original game. Goodbye, Steam, goodbye Valve."
"Don't buy it for more than $5. Devs didn't fix the netcode at all, some matches can and will be very laggy and frustrating."
"this game have been on steam for more than one year now and sadly there is still low fps when full screen and big lags in multiplayer games, and apparently we are quite a lot experiencing that. so finally this HD version is worst than the original. hope they fix that soon, it's a shame that a HD remake has important issues like those a year after its release"
"This is everything you expect from Age of Empires II, and nothing more. The game is different on a few points: easy multiplayer matching, higher graphics and higher population cap. To my opinion the pricing of € 18,99 is too steep.   When should you buy the game: - you loved age of empires 2 - you are willing to pay the price - it's at discount  To my opinion if you really want to play Age of empires 2, get the CD out of the dusty closet!"
"I really recommend u not to buy this game. If u want to play the old campaigns and matches vs the computer you ll have the same experience with the original version. If u buy this game to play online with friends u will be really disappointed because the multiplayer is unplayable due to extreme laggs. It really is a disgrace that even 9 Month after release this issue, which was mentioned buy the community since the start of the game, still isnt solved and that themultiplayer still is unplayable.  So as a conclusion i can say that even the biggest Fans of the original AoE 2 should not waste their money by buying this piece of crap. If u want to play this game get yourself the original version and use programms like voobly to play with ur firends.   edit: game is on sale atm for 4,75euro i think thats what the game is worth just for the singleplayer so i recommend buying it for that price."
The lag on multiplayer kills it. A very enjoyable game aside from that problem.
"Bad port. Multiplayer disconnects and de syncs constantly when playing with friends, even on the same LAN. The restore game feature doesnt work period. Mouse randomly dissappears. No resolution or video options. No LAN option vs playing through steam. Horrible lag randomly, while on good connection. Would be great when it works, but as of now it doesnt."
"The original 14-years old version plays much better than this, even online. Just to remind you, in 2001 we had 56k connections."
"While I did enjoy the original Age of Empires with my family extensively and this one does handle Single Player like I remember but with more current resolutions, it fails in one very important area. Being able to play multiplayer is a critical part of this game for me. With high end machines on a LAN with extremely low ping times it constantly desyncs and has lag issues. If you look at the discussions they have relegated discussions on fixing this to a single pinned topic. Basically it seems to be there so the forums are not flooded with people having issues. They can let people post in that thread and seemingly do nothing to address it.   I am all for expansions and new content, but not if the base game is not fixed. I do realize many people are having no issues, but there seems to be a high number of people who are.  If you only plan on playing this single player then I can recommend it. If you plan on playing multiplayer I cannot receommend it since there is a strong possibility it will not work for you and you won't be able to get any assistance or commitment from the developers to fix it."
"I hope they release an update soon, because this game cannot run on Windows 10. It just constantly crashes. Sucks too, becauase I love this game"
aoe II HD on steam = LAG/FPSlow
"Don't be decieved by the 100+ hours I've spent on this game, that was in better times. The recent updates/bug fixes had the unintended consequence of creating more bugs. The game is now practically unplayable, as if it were possible to make the multiplayer even worse ! 90% of the games you play will lag terribly, and someone will drop out within the first five minutes, to your dismay it will usually be someone on your team, rendering the match distressingly unfair.   The community consists of rank obsessed, loyal, die hard fans that have no regard whatsoever when it comes to fair play and have accepted this ♥♥♥♥ and awful broken multiplayer. You can still find unranked, arena type games, such as castle blood, where the objective is to out kill your opponent which levels up your never ending spawn of troops, but these are frustrating due to multiplayer issues.   The biggest trouble is multiplayer, it is totally broken. Some players are courteous enough to rush their enemy when an opponents team mate drops, to end the suffering as quickly as possible, occasionally someone will drop out to even teams, but most laughably carry on as though it's still fair game, despite being 4v3, or 4v2, or worse. You might be lucky and have two lag outs, one on each team making it a fair 3v3 or 2v2. You will roll the dice every time you play, in the worst possible way. I don't blame people for being unsportsman like, it's so hard to actually get a game going, getting through the loading screen, by the end you're just desperate to play something, anything at all, even if you have no chance of winning, or equally, the opposing team has no chance of winning because lag claimed a victim on their side, it's frustating, as the game will almost NEVER play out as intended from the start, you just want that sense of blood and carnage, it's so difficult to reach that point due to the bugs.   People rarely leave out of courtesy to even the teams once a player has dropped or lagged out so the game is instantly over in some cases. If lag claims a victim on the opposing side expect a desperate rush from your opponent in order to rebalance the game, or expect a team mate of yours to capitalise on your opponents misfortune by moving in on the dead players position and building in close proximity to gold, iron etc, often cutting off the trade links for market carts, meaning the opposing team has no chance at all of making a comeback. If the dice roll in your favour, you may as well go afk, have a shower or make yourself some food instead, that's if you don't lag out yourself, because the game will not be challenging at all, you've basically won, it's 4v3, or 4v2, you are sitting pretty, why not send your villagers to attack the enemy base? May as well try and amuse yourself somehow because it's otherwise no fun at all. This buggy and broken multiplayer has lead to some interesting developments in gaming strategy/style. Some players have adapted to predicted lagouts, by rushing and trying to eliminate a player at the very start, thereby increasing their odds of winning. How sad and pathetic that a game's multiplayer in 2015 is so broken players have to include alternative strategies to accomodate the event within their scope of play. AoE2 was always plagued by terrible multiplayer.  There are so few games in the multiplayer lobby, even at peak times, the chance of you finding one in close proximity is remote which is important because any games you play worldwide will increase the probability of lag and almost certain drop outs. Any communication 'lag' issues with other players is delighfully displayed on the game screen at the start. You will be dissapointed when you join a lobby only to find you lag with another player, the traffic light system green, meaning slim chance of lagg/drop out (but by no means guaranteed), yellow, meaning odds of lag/drop out is over 50%, red meaning don't even bother, it's unlikely you'll get through the loading screen. I mean really these are windows 95/98 issues that never got resolved, it's an absolute disgrace. You will spend more time in loading screens/lobbies trying to play than actually playing.    Having said all that, if you don't mind being unable to play multiplayer, the single player has a lot to offer. Sadly even those that love RTS will, I doubt, wish to spend hours on their own doing the single player campaign or death matches against AI in this era of gaming. Multiplayer is the only real thing this ancient game has going for it, and that is totally ♥♥♥♥ed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, trust me on this, save yourself the frustration, because it never gets any better."
"Dear developers, don't ever create another dlc. The game is completely unplayable even after a week of this."
"Game is very buggy, slow framerate despite the fact that my 20 year old pentium 3 could play the original just fine. Idle villager button doesnt work, units are unresponsive and do not follow commands well - trebuchets do not pack and unpack as desired, do not attack intended targets when unpacked, units walk away from destination before approaching whenever commands are issued. Graphics are very glitchy, villagers get stuck when farming and stop harvesting, etc etc etc stay away from this, it's not worth the convenience of being on steam."
if you like constantly crashing multiplayer then this is for you!! good work on the latest patch.
"Loved the original, was a bit dissapointed in the updates, was hoping for a bit more from the 'HD Edition' "
"Long time favorite, the game has been around since 2000 and I enjoy more than any game, great gameplay and different maps, many different civilizations and game modes make it a new experience everytime! 100 out of 10!"
"Played this so many times back in college, and it has never lost its appeal even all these 15 years later... 100% recommended"
Good game but a coop mode would be awesome 8/10
"Much fun, such strategy. wow."
"The classic. This games is for all of those who loved to spend hours in hard online battle with two enemies, the opposite player and the bad internet connection of those times."
"Age of Empires II HD is a real-time strategy from Microsoft Studios. It is a remake of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.  All gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.  The graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.  Well, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this. And by the way, I've been playing this game for over 6 years :)  Rating 10/10"
"Buyers Aware, this version no longer supports multiplayer game through local network. U have to connect to the server. Only for collection's purpose."
"By far one of my favorite games. I still play it despite the fact that it is over ten years old. A litmus test that I compare other strategy games to in order to determine their worth. Mechanics are solid, gameplay is addictive, espescially when you can play with friends. I would higly suggest purchasing a four-pack (or two) when the game goes on sale to give to your friends. My only complaint is that the quick match service does not work very well, but this is a moot point if you have friends that play. All in all, a fantastic game. May this game see another ten years of fame!"
"Definitely one of my classic favorites. I bought this when I was in my late teens, back in the day. I still get the same smug satisfaction I did back then, turning hand cannoners against innocent villagers. Nothing beats pounding a couple beers, and hamfistedly destroying a glorious empire from humankind's history. It's like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a fine work of art, and I'm okay with that."
"Age of Empires II HD still stands the test of time. HD brings a great look to the solid historic war strategy gameplay. This is the type of game you can lose 8 hours in a day on easy. The little intro audio clips help set the scene for some of the most epic battles in the history of planet earth. If you dig army building games, if you dig the history of war....GET THIS GAME its rad!"
"Besides the 8-bit trash they call HD graphics it is rather fun. The idea is solid and the gameplay isn't half bad, the AI could use more tweking but its nothing major to deal with once you know your stuff. All in all ill give it a 8/10 if you want better grahics play the 3rd in the series because this is not HD."
Good Classic game
"For those who grew up playing this classic RTS like I did, it's the same exact thing only backed with Steamworks supported matchmaking and Workshop accessibility allowing you to hold matches with comparatively more stable and reliable connections as well as ease of access to custom maps and campaigns.  Contrary to the 'HD' neatly branded on this game's logo, it does not actually add anything new in terms of visuals. Water and cliff graphics have been cleaned up a bit and updated but the look largely remains the same. The difference is that this game will upscale properly to a widescreen format.  At the time of writing, the current early access version has several glitches that actually cause framerate lag even in single player, but they're currently being worked out. Aside from this, the game is exactly how you'd expect it to be.  Long story short, it's just the old king of RTS brought back with support for modern day matchmaking and display systems with no real gameplay changes.   If you played this game before and didn't like it, this updated version won't change your mind. If you did, then just pick this up and enjoy it with your friends just like back in the day without the fuss of setting up Hamachi or a reliable direct IP connection as you would for the original game.  On the negatives, matchmaking through LAN has been stripped out of the game despite this game having to be one of the biggest staples of LAN parties everywhere. Seriously, what the hell?"
"Absolutely amazing game. I would recommend it to anybody, from a person who never played strategy games before, to a well-seasoned professional. Very good gameplay, and the Steam Workshop for it has lots of things. Texture packs, mods, and campaigns that are all worth a try!"
"Best Strategy Game from all time. It may take you a loooooong time to get to the lvl of the current players, (They've been playing since its release +10years!) but when you start to taste the victories... there's no turning back!"
"Forever holding a spot as one of my favorite games of all time, Age of Empires II HD remains to this day an immersive, stylistic classic with an incredible soundtrack and a highly competitive and in-depth multiplayer, the likes of which you would be hard pressed to find in many of today's games. A must-have for any RTS enthusiast."
Good work with the graphics for a game from 1999!? Hardest Dificulty is more realistic for the computer players.
"Fun game that takes me back to my youth. Still playing this with friends, and always delivers us hours of fun."
"Absolutely awesome game. I have been playing it for more than 15 years and I still enjoy it as much as I did first time. The gameplay is unbeatable. Strategy, tactics its all there. Some people say its too old and too simple - I say: TRY IT and you will know whats up (that is of course if you enjoy strategy games)"
If you like old-school sprite-based RTSes this is for you
"Great game, and if your someone who likes long matches and city building then this game is for you. It may not have the best grafics as some of the games today however i beleive that its grafic style suites the game. so plz go buy this game and show it some support."
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL THE BRITISH IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL
5/5
"If you're expecting anything other than the ability to easily play AoE2 on Steam, you might be disappointed. However, if you just want to play the classic game with some Steam hooks (Workshop, matchmaking, etc.) you'll be very happy.  The game itself holds up very well, even if some features that are in modern RTS games are not present. I have put in a ton of time with this game, and plan to put in even more!"
"Basically, this is the same AoE2 game that you are familiar with last decade, but with several new twists.  It is a quintessential RTS that you must experience if you haven't already. Adding to the multitude of units, technology and strategies are Workshop mods that further enhance the gameplay and depth of the game for both your offline and online needs.  The new African Kingdoms expansion offers a great opportunity for players to start their AoE experience and see for themselves how this game has survived and evolved to its present incarnation.  Note: Disregard the Steam-registered play time; I spend my AoE times off-site with AoC."
"Fun, quick paced in multiplayer, awesome"
I've been playing AoE since I was just a kid. I'm so glad they have this on steam now. The experiance is much better when you have friends to play it with. 
I wish that my good friend Kaleb would stop rekting my ♥♥♥♥ as this.  It makes me feel inferior as a man.
nice game plays the same like the classic money wel spend 
No words how much I like Age Of Empire 2. Its just outstanding in every aspect. Also the latest release in Age of Empires II was a remake of the original with just better graphics (HD). Even all the scenarios and characters are the same. It definitely looks beautiful.   9/10
"Yes, this is the same Age of Empire we had in the 90s! Endless Hrs of multiplayer and fun single player storys. Very, very easy to learn but, holy he!! hard to master. Played this for as long as i can remeber back in the day. Never gets old, very sick mods for tons of stuff, best 20$ ever spent, and the DLCs add new civs we never had back when. Be warmed in multiplayer takes your FULL attention to win! +will run on bout anything!!!!!"
"A classic game I played a lot as a kid. The HD version was done very well and it still feels like the game I played all those years ago just more up to date. For the life of me I always get my ♥♥♥ kicked in multiplayer though.  9/10 A must buy classic for anyone who played this as a kid, it's also easy to pick up and provides hours of fun for those new to the franchise/genre."
hours of fun.
"A familiar face in the Real-Time Strategy genre, the re-release of Age of Empires II is a must have both for its grueling gameplay and nostalgia value."
Greatest game from my childhood. Still the only RTS I will play; game is hard. Learn history while fearing the yellow man. 10/10
"Played for the nostalgia, but actually remembered I wasn't even good at the game. Still a great rts 10/10"
Wololo
"This Game includes everything an RTS has to offer, and more.  Over the past decade and a half people have created mini games, movies, tournaments, artwork, maps, gamemodes, rpgs, comedies, and other things.  Don't just expect what you will get out of the main game, it isn't just filled with 1v1s and team games like every other rts. This Game breeds creativity, and is very easy to share that.  Plus the competitive scene is very much there and alive, and you can get into it if you want."
what can i say about aoe2 that hasnt already been said.
destroyed my cousin for a few months in this game...he then decides to practice...destroys me for a few months...  truly the greatest rts ever rate 8 outta 8 great bait mate
"I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. I wish I had Steam when I was younger because the amount of hours I spent on this game when it was released was unreal. I religiously played this game. It's also so awesome with some of the crazy ♥♥♥ cheats like 'how do you turn this on' gives you a Shelby Cobra car that fires cannon balls like a machine gun. Nothing scares your opponents like 4 wheels of gunpowder madness. Cheats aside, this game is a fantastic city building RTS with an amazing tech tree and unique units to each of the different civilizations. For me it's always the Britons being an English lad of course. Nothing beats an army of 50 elite longbowmen with heated shot (fire arrows) upgrade. Also the fun part about playing a skirmish against computer opponent is the fact that they always seem to launch premature strikes on your base as like a 'provocative strategic manoeuvre', when really all they end up doing is getting completely mauled by the little army of archers/foot soldiers that you have been obtaining (alternatively they can keep sending ungodly amount of troops somehow 5 minutes into gameplay when you're just building your 3rd house and got about 3 farms up and running, and then slaughtering and griefing your tiny little village). Regardless of that nonsense, when you've fortified your city with walls and built 7 billion castles around the edges with a couple of watch towers dotted in between, you can safely start to build your mahoosive army which you then take on one massive campaign and dominate the AIs. Alternatively, if you're a sh-i-te commander then you'll have to end up going out with an army and getting them all slaughtered and then having to spend out resources and building another one. On the bright side there are achievements on Steam for getting your own units killed (such an incentive I know!). There are awesome formation settings and attack stances that separate you (an organised battle tactician) from the computer AI (naked blue body painted savages that throw all of their units and resources away).  It's always so awesome looking at the end of scenario report and seeing your stats sky rocket above the rest of the players. As for online, I've never played online so find that out for yourself.  Buy this game immediately because of reasons and because of a unit called a Petard (I know right) that you train in a castle and it's basically a medieval suicide bomber.  20/10 - love this game"
Just plain good
"One of the best RTS games i have ever played, if you are going to get any of the Age series get this or Age of Mythology."
"I must admit, playing this game as a kid back in the day was one of the best things around. As a fan of strategy games I can promise you that this game just gets better and better with age.  There have been some tweaks and balances to some civilisations and units but the game hasn't majorly changed and is still awesome. If you can find it on sale it should be a no brainer, especially sice the multiplayer has been brought back to life. Yes you can play 4v4 or 6v6 or whatver you want with your frineds, and if you dont have friends dont worry! The AI is ridiculous and will surely provide a good challenge. 10/10 would monk army again"
"After having a BIG break from Age of Empires I checked the steam store and found this game and I bought it. I can remember me and oon played Age of Empires when we were about 8 years old. I like everything about this game excpept the muitplayer save issue. Me and Bollekukk tried making a multiplayer save and when our internet connection went off we were not able to load the map again... We even saved it several times. I read on the internet that several people have the same problem, but I think they should fix this issue by now. The game has been out for so long that it should be done years ago.. Still is lots of fun to play single player. Definately buy this game if you have some cash and you feel like going back in time fighting aztecs and vikings :))"
"After playing this game since I was around 5 years old, I still play it now at 22!"
"Age of Empires II, war arena where friendships get destroyed."
"Epic game, a never dying classic."
seems like a cool game... havent played enough to really get the feel for it yet tho...
simply the best!
Roses are red  WOLOLO Roses are blue
"Never ending fun, challenge and learning.Every battle online present a new experience"
Joined game with friend Rushed to kill me and i was like :O nooez Dies REMATCH Gets ingame Spawns hundreds of monkey things Sent monkeys to kill him The monkeys were OP and he got wrecked I won Went on to become best player in universe
DUKE OF NORMADY I TOLD YOU I DONT HAVE ANY ♥♥♥♥ING WOOD
Great game as it always was but with improvements! This version is also widescreen where as the original was not also there are new civilizations. In my opinion it is one of the best strategy games out there despite its original release date. There is also multiplayer which is great fun. its a must buy!
"Fully integrated Age of Empires II in steam. Direct join friends from the friendslist.  Graphics are not alot better, considering the game is so old. It does work in full 1080p HD resolution though."
I played it with my dad back in the day it's still a great game 100% worth a buy
"Let me tell you a story. I call it The Adventures of Agent Cobra: Episode 69: Checkmate.  Our heroes, Agent Cobra and his furious monkey-boy sidekick Furious have just returned to their Byzantine castle hideout in the mountains. No sooner had they returned than a new document was faxed to their secret missions-only fax machine. Furious picked it up.  'Zimmering zwounds, Agent Cobra, it's a message from the leader of the Byzantines!' He said, flapping the page in the air.  'Well, Furious my boy, what does it say?' He was calm, nonchalant, which was odd, given the traumatic conclusion of their last adventure. Of course, being a car with an automatic assault rifle in the hood, his emotions were difficult to gauge.  'I'm not sure. The message reads: 'how do you turn this on roggan wololo wololo wololo roggan start the game already start the game already don't point that thing at me furious the monkey boy wood please wood please woodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwood please &lt;laughs&gt;. Stop. Sincerely, The Byzantine Leader'. What does it mean, Agent Cobra?'  'Furious my boy, that's a cipher,' he said, as he somehow lit a cigarette. Puffing a noxious cloud from his exhaust, he continued, 'If I'm not mistaken, it can be decrypted to mean 'Dear Cobra Car and Furious the Monkey Boy: I am aware of the dangers of requesting your assistance so often, especially given the... emotional nature of your last mission,'' he shrugged, ''but I fear circumstances have left me with no choice. The reasons for your new mission are confidential, I fear, but your objective is simple: the enemy king must die. Do this and you shall be rewarded.''  'You decrypted that in your head?'  'Many newer cars have onboard computers...'  'Well, yeah, but not for cryptog...'  'We ride, Furious my boy, to slay the enemy king.'  'But which enemy did he mean, Agent Cobra? There are so many. The Aztecs, the Koreans, the Malians, the Franks; how will we know which one to assassinate?'  Cobra put his tire on the confused sidekick's shoulder. 'The only way we know how, Furious my boy. The only way we know how.'  And that, my son, is why there are so many ruined castles in Europe, and a few in Asia, Africa and Central America."
is good name town pat
"I admit I haven't gotten around to playing much of this since I got it on Steam, but I played it a lot way back when. Excellent game, excellent update.   Age of Empires is like what would happen if you made Civilization into an RTS. You choose a civilization, then build and explore in typical RTS fashion. As you construct buildings and units, you can advance into technological eras, which give you more things to build and research. You can also contruct markets to trade with other cultures.   That about explains the concept of the game right there, it's a well-made RTS with a heavy Civilization influence.   This release, AoE2HD is interesting because this game was released and finished well over a decade ago, a sequel and spinoff were made, and it should have gone the way of most superceded games. Instead, it was revisited and remade, designed to work on modern computers and look good on today's HD monitors, with the expansion and additional content merged with the game, similar to Paradox's release of Majesty Gold HD. Unlike Majesty Gold HD, however, the update for AoE2 didn't stop at patching the game, development continues with a new expansion pack and active support.   Basically this is a case of a developer bringing a game back from the dead successfully, because of the devotion of the fans, and it is a rewarding and refreshing thing to see."
One of the best strategy games of all time!
"The most treasured RTS, AoE II HD preserves its nostalgic values while adding new civilizations into the fray.  This game doesn't just flat out put civilizations you can play as, but you get to know their history, which is a very nice touch.  Also, any accidental drops in ELO or MMR matchmaking systems are virtually nonexistent, unlike in AoM:EE. When your game crashes, you don't lose any ranking at all.  That being said though, this beautiful, well-crafted game only needs to maximize multiplayer security and robustness to fully ensure that every single minute you spend in multiplayer is just as good as playing the game yourself in singleplayer.  The new multiplayer system in servers have changed. Now there's two types of AoE II games that can be played; Original Game (Age of Kings + The Conquerors) and the Expansions (Original Game + The Forgotten + The African Kingdoms.) Servers can now choose to either host these two AoE II games. HOWEVER, if you join an Expansions server, you are stuck to a LIMITED pool of civilizations to choose from, unless you own the Forgotten, or the African Kingdoms. I highly recommend that you buy this game in addition with at least one expansion pack in order to prevent restricted options in multiplayer; the selection pool EVEN limits Age of Kings and Age of Conquerors civs.  Overall, it's a great RTS that shows historical values of the civilizations you play, providing the same, satisfying gameplay experience. However, it suffers from crashing in multiplayer games, and the fact that there's a limited pool of civilizations to choose from for people who join Expansions game servers, yet don't own any of the two expansions, hinders multiplayer experience for people who've already bought the original.  My favorite number is 30lololololol."
Now if only they would port and/or redo the original AoE...
Old but gold. Sadly this remake doesn't fix any problems/bugs of the orginal one. Because of the improved compatibility with Windows 7/8 it's still worth buying during a sale.  7/10
10/10 would not play again
You can play f*cking ranked! amazing! 9/10 Best rts ever made.  I bought the 4 pack and a friend of mine too so we played togheter with 8 people big fun!
"Age of Empires 2 is a masterpiece.  Get it. NOW. :3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- This game is very good, it may be hard if you are now a pro RTS player or new at the game, Or just new to RTS games in general. But with practice and time this game is very fun. Well. it is still fun when you are new. I may not have many hours on the game,  But I have played it a lot before it was on steam. This review may not be written well. But I hope I helped decide if you want the game or not. Thank you for reading my review. Good bye ^^"
"A classic, maybe  the  classic. Get it."
IT'S LIKE AGE OF EMPIRES  BUT HD
"The first PC game I've ever played, now in HD©"
"  It's a good game, so sad it lacks LAN servers without mods, but it is still worth it"
"This game brings back so many memories of my childhood.  Be it playing through the campaigns, or being slaughtered by the Hard AI in Skirmishes there is always a lot of fun to be had playing this game.  So glad that I can play it again. :D"
"Gotta be one of my favourite RTS no game is the same always different Strats &amp; good paper, rock, scissor mechanics to always keep you trying to make counters than just make the largest army  I'll try to write a proper full review at a later date"
"As great as ever, with new balance and still valid gameplay. Lots of content in Steam Workshop on top of that.  Enjoy it whether you are competetive RTS player or casual looking for some fun in game modes such as tower defence."
How do you turn this on?
Still one of the best RTS games I've ever played.
One of the best strategy game ever!!
"With the new expansion some bugs have appeared ( such as idle villager button not working), but once all the kinks are worked out it will return to being a PERFECT lan party game"
it is awsome if you got burned by ahem stronghold ugh 3 this is better at lest watch the trailer and then watch lets plays on youtube :D
"HELL YEAH. it's awesome, same as the ols one, but AI seems ALOT harder to kill. good fun"
why would you replace the meat icon with corn why would you change all the hotkeys around to make them more awkward 9/10 it's okay
"Fun, quick paced in multiplayer, awesome"
"Great game. I do not think it deserves such a low metascore. It is a recreation of a classic, and works flawlessly. There is no features ommited."
5/5
"Basically, this is the same AoE2 game that you are familiar with last decade, but with several new twists.  It is a quintessential RTS that you must experience if you haven't already. Adding to the multitude of units, technology and strategies are Workshop mods that further enhance the gameplay and depth of the game for both your offline and online needs.  The new African Kingdoms expansion offers a great opportunity for players to start their AoE experience and see for themselves how this game has survived and evolved to its present incarnation.  Note: Disregard the Steam-registered play time; I spend my AoE times off-site with AoC."
The game is pretty much like the old low res version right now and yes I am writing this for the stupid badge.
Good game but a coop mode would be awesome 8/10
"Age of Empires II was and still is easily one of the best RTS titles of its time, rivaled only by Starcraft. Even after 14 long years, AoE II is still very playable. HD Edition offers nothing more than a way for Windows 7 users to play the game in full 1080p+ without visual glitches and uses steam integration to make connecting to other players easier. I enjoy the fact the title was untouched gameplay-wise, because I felt the original game was already very complete and well-rounded.  It's a classic, endless playability, yet quickly to become familiar with and easy to improve your performance. It was my favorite game growing up as a kid and still is an incredibly satisfying game to play.  For all the RTS fans out there, totally recommend it."
"Played this so many times back in college, and it has never lost its appeal even all these 15 years later... 100% recommended"
"Love this game, use to have this on disk and the hd version is even better."
"Long time favorite, the game has been around since 2000 and I enjoy more than any game, great gameplay and different maps, many different civilizations and game modes make it a new experience everytime! 100 out of 10!"
one of best RTS updated? best idea ever
this game is awesome!
Loved this game when this came out and still love it to this day
Just like the old one.

"One of the best strategy games in all the time, in my childhood i spent a lot of hours in this game, and now im glad to see that we have a remake, maybe we don't have new graphics or fixed bugs but the multiplayer is excellent, and well, now we have a new expansion and workshop and the AoE community is developing a lot of maps mods etc. that gives the game a lot of playable hours, so, don't think about it, just buy this game if you´re AoE fans you will enjoy this again and again, and if you don't know about RTS, well, this game simplily is awesome."

"Unable to play after buying lots of licenses from India - Pings are bad. Needs Local LAN play, something like Dota 2 Local Lobby."
If you haven't play. Play it Master Snarga!
It's kind of like civ 5 without the frustration of waiting for your friends to make a move
'Start the game already!'
This game is mint.
"When this game was released in 1999, is was considered one of the best RTS games ever made and it still is. Some mechanics of the game are a little clunky compared to todays RTS games, but overall it can hold up with the best today and hardly gets boring."
"I finally got my hands on this game. Its like going back in highschool again. the ai changed tho like back then when you chose a higher difficulty, everything was carnage immediately after you start the game. now the ai thinks instead of going all berzerk n ♥♥♥♥."
its cool
"This game is amazing. It's gameplay is challenging and unique everytime you play. New maps give new challenges, and It takes quite a while to develop a strategy. (I haven't yet). The scenario editor let's you make silly, challenging, and fun scenarios for you and your friends to play. I'd give this game a 9/10."
A great way to excersize your brain.
"This is by far maybe the most iconic and interesting games of the 2000nds. The original game was so good, I don't even remember when I first started playing it from a DVD. I must have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours since my first ever AoE II game. I still have my old DVD with the game.  So why do you need the HD Edition? I've tried and the original still works fine on my 1080p screen, so what's the point of buying a game if you already have it? If we don't count the much better graphics, the answer is the content. With the HD edition from Steam, it adds so much more interesting possibilities.  First is the Steam Workshop. You can now download for free hundreds of maps, enhanced graphics or elements or even new troops and buildings.  Second, the DLCs. You can't add 'The African Kingdoms' and 'The Forgotten' DLCs to the original game without tinkering with the game. I prefer to pay a few dollars/euros to get it from here than trying to find it on some sketchy Reddit post.  And last, but not least, the multiplayer games. Whenever I tried to go in a multiplayer server on the DVD game, I was directed to a Microsoft website that told me that they stopped supporting multiplayer battles. it is essential to try multiplayer and learn from some veterans, who know all the best tactics and some might even try to help you learn to play better.  As a conclusion, this is probably one of my most favorite games and I think that you would like it as much as me."
"This is a refreshing reboot of the timeless game that will be played for generations to come. They've added support for larger monitors and even multiple ones which is awesome. They've added new civilizations which is also a welcome move.   The new campaigns though lack the voice acting that made the original conquerors and age of kings feel more real.   The developers have removed local lobby which is a HUGE drawback of this game. You always end up playing online with someone with a moderate to poor ping. The number of players that are on multiplayer is dwindling quickly down to a trickle as of Sept 2014. Given this, the lack of local multiplayer is a major drawback I hope the developers will consider re-adding into the game.   I am recommending this game purely because of the potential that it has and the hope that the developers are encouraged to continue development to improve the game, build a community of followers around it. This game has future potential and is a fun game to play offline."
"This game kicks so much ♥♥♥! I love this game so much. If you're an RTS fan and haven't played this, you need to play it immediately, and even if you're not a fan of RTS games, this game is enough to get you hooked.  Endless replayabililty, HOURS of entertainment..  5 ololololol McLovin's out of 5"
"Gets laggy from time to time (if pings are over 100, there's at least a 250 millisecond delay I've found) but if you play 1v1 you will probably not lag at all. The game looks good, maybe not any different from how it used to be, but hey. The gameplay is just as it was: excellent, seemingly balanced, and entertaining.   There's a 'Save and Exit' spam trick to slow down the game's progress by about 20x that I was the victim of once. The guy had lost so he just spammed that option, which opens a window that everybody has to respond to in the game before the game can progress.   Most people playing it are fun-loving and just nostalgic like me though! If you loved Aoe2 you'll have a good time in AoE2HD."
"Great modern port of the massively popular cult classic, multiplayer has been improved and it works like a charm."
"Absolutely perfect upgarded version. Can play with Move+Attack as in Starcraft which has changed definitely the game. Resolution has been fixed, 500 pop possible, a huge choice of Civilisation now and tons of new game style, map etc. As when I was kid, the campaign can also initiate people to some important and not well known part of the history. Age 2 is 'must have'."
"Just Minotaur spam their calvary archers on any challanger ranked match, I even tried it in a bronze-trim skirmish and got like 500 gold ore with over 200 ducats remaining"

I wish that my good friend Kaleb would stop rekting my ♥♥♥♥ as this.  It makes me feel inferior as a man.
"Great game, and if your someone who likes long matches and city building then this game is for you. It may not have the best grafics as some of the games today however i beleive that its grafic style suites the game. so plz go buy this game and show it some support."
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL THE BRITISH IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL

I've been playing AoE since I was just a kid. I'm so glad they have this on steam now. The experiance is much better when you have friends to play it with. 
"If you're expecting anything other than the ability to easily play AoE2 on Steam, you might be disappointed. However, if you just want to play the classic game with some Steam hooks (Workshop, matchmaking, etc.) you'll be very happy.  The game itself holds up very well, even if some features that are in modern RTS games are not present. I have put in a ton of time with this game, and plan to put in even more!"
This Lit 🔥
Started playing this game many many moons ago as a small child. (Dads first computer came with it as a demo) im talking about the late 90's. Grew up playing it (single player only) and the original disk i had finally gave up the ghost in 2009 when i tried to run it in a modern laptop -.- i must have played it from being 6-16 years old so already knew the base game extremely well. when i found out about Steam (my partner was on here but i didnt know!!) i thought id look it up and bingo here it is! in HD too with all the expansions which i never got to play back in the day! Honestly one of the best games i have ever played and it has kept me entertained on many a night while our lad is on the xbox one! i 1000% recommend this game to anyone. Yes some of the games can be 3-4-5 hours long but its so exhilerating when you finally get the win. #Wololo :)
Jai should buy this game.
The game that never gets old.
"A game that I played throughout my childhood and still today, 10 years later. Its always fun to play, I recommend getting it, or at least looking into it."
This game is mint.
"When this game was released in 1999, is was considered one of the best RTS games ever made and it still is. Some mechanics of the game are a little clunky compared to todays RTS games, but overall it can hold up with the best today and hardly gets boring."
"One of my oldest and most treasured games, endless hours of entertainment here. Original old school RTS with a great active community to back"
'Start the game already!'
Bring back old memories. Such a nice game.
If you haven't play. Play it Master Snarga!
"Perfect RTS. Balance, choices, speed, everything perfect.  Plus, community is great."
A classic and amazing RTS! Wololo !! Just stop reading my review and go buy this game!
"So much nostalgia in this game for me, I recommend that anyone who likes RTS' should get this game, unlike newer games that use 3D models this game uses flat, still images making it look quite marvelous in terms of detail, the sound effects are nice and the scenario making is also fun.  The biggest problem with this game is it's stability, online games can be riddled with lag early on in games making a good start hard to do, but past that little hiccup I see a great game for both base-building &amp; war!"
It's kind of like civ 5 without the frustration of waiting for your friends to make a move
"Such a fun game, with such a great community! It's also really easy to learn! The first time I played online I got beat up extremely hard. The second time I was playing agaisnt a very high elo player which after the game helped me to get started. Now after just a few practice games I'm shaping up and becoming really good. 10/10, just buy it!"
"Long time, no siege.  Woolooloo.  All Hail, King of the Losers!  Sure, blame it on your ISP!  Quit touching me!  Buy this just for the audio taunts, everything else is bonus."
"Ive been playing this game since i was about 7, its possibley the best strategy RTS alive and im glad they brought it to steam to share with a large population that has never seen age of empires 2. A simply must have for all command and conquer junkies &lt;3 trust me you love it"
I never played this game when I was younger but my brother certainly did.  10/10 Would live my brother's childhood again.
"I have played the original for most of my life. Both single player, and in large groups at parties. it never gets old!"
"Yes, this is the same Age of Empire we had in the 90s! Endless Hrs of multiplayer and fun single player storys. Very, very easy to learn but, holy he!! hard to master. Played this for as long as i can remeber back in the day. Never gets old, very sick mods for tons of stuff, best 20$ ever spent, and the DLCs add new civs we never had back when. Be warmed in multiplayer takes your FULL attention to win! +will run on bout anything!!!!!"
"Great modern port of the massively popular cult classic, multiplayer has been improved and it works like a charm."
"Absolutely perfect upgarded version. Can play with Move+Attack as in Starcraft which has changed definitely the game. Resolution has been fixed, 500 pop possible, a huge choice of Civilisation now and tons of new game style, map etc. As when I was kid, the campaign can also initiate people to some important and not well known part of the history. Age 2 is 'must have'."
Absolutely love the game and to hear that it came to steam in a HD version was mind blowing. I own all age of empires games and even played back in the 'zone' in the age of dial up. Still current and beautifully remastered. Only 6 hours played so far but wholeheartedly love playing and making my own maps and scenarios!
"23hrs on steam and countless hours on the original AoE2 via disc. Updated for modern systems (for myself i no longer have to run a batch file for windows explorer to close when i started my game on Win7 64bit so the colors weren't just R,B,G and Purple) This also means higher resolution and some remade textures (eg cliffs) BUT if you don't like some of the textures or just want a change, Steam Workshop. There are so many different top quality texture remakes to make the game look slighty or very different, but still keeping the legendary gameplay we all know and love. Updates are still happening. Population can go past 200 now! I don't have anything negative to say. Apparently the multiplayer can have some lag issues, but i dont play MP so I can't confirm. Either way, i think any PC gamer ever should pick up this classic. $20 is worth it IMO and its on sale quite often ive found. So buy it, have fun, increase your intelligence with all the tactics and civilisations, and learn a bit of history along the way!"
"Overall the game is decent, I would not call this a 'HD' edition more like a widerscreen edition with barely noticable to no graphi enhancements. Despite this I would still recomend this game to you as it still makes playing multiplayer far easier than trying to hook it up to sites. Although there are issues, not the ones with multiplayer lag, but the fact that this is not a HD edition but its still like the original game which is nice as trying to make the orignal disk to work with windows 7 for me just never works  I would rate this a 7/10"
"75% off? Now is the time to get this game. If you own a pirated copy, you can spare this much. If you don't own it? Its worth it. By far my favorite game to play on LAN versus other people of all time. Arguably the best Age of Empires title to date. Workshop support hasn't helped it a great deal, asside from a few great texture packs."
"From a forgoten time when gaming was about a good time, not about getting the game 2 work properly.  Very nice remake."
Wololo... 0/10 converted to 10/10
"I'm going to being with the negative aspects of this game: It's old and the graphics aren't amazing. However, it still looks great and will not hinder your game play.  Now, we'll delve into the positive aspecs: After all these years, this game's playability has not aged at all.  There is so much versatility in how this game can be played. Looking for competitive strategy? This is your game. Looking for silly shenanigans? This is also your game.  With steam, this game has become so much easier to play online and with friends. If there is a sale, don't hesistate and grab a four pack. Grab one for yourself and 3 for buddies that you know will enjoy it.  p.s Sneaking in with your monk and stealing relics under people's noses is delicious. WOLOLOLOLOLOLO"
"With the new expansion some bugs have appeared ( such as idle villager button not working), but once all the kinks are worked out it will return to being a PERFECT lan party game"
it is awsome if you got burned by ahem stronghold ugh 3 this is better at lest watch the trailer and then watch lets plays on youtube :D
"Age of Empires II HD Edition is an amazing reboot into, in my opinion, one of the best RTS games ever made. I'm playing in 2k and it just looks amazing, and unlike a lot of reboots it runs without any bugs, hitches or crashes.   The multiplayer matchmaking and ELO based ranking system make it tons of fun to play; catering to the competitive market which has allowed a renewed and very much welcome return to the Age of Empires competitive scene.  For the more casual players, what is more fun than a 4v4 regicide free for all amongst good friends? Well, maybe a few things but it is certainly up there!  You can catch me playing this game frequently on my stream on  hitbox.tv/yent  - hit me up if you want to play! :)"
destroyed my cousin for a few months in this game...he then decides to practice...destroys me for a few months...  truly the greatest rts ever rate 8 outta 8 great bait mate
"I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. I wish I had Steam when I was younger because the amount of hours I spent on this game when it was released was unreal. I religiously played this game. It's also so awesome with some of the crazy ♥♥♥ cheats like 'how do you turn this on' gives you a Shelby Cobra car that fires cannon balls like a machine gun. Nothing scares your opponents like 4 wheels of gunpowder madness. Cheats aside, this game is a fantastic city building RTS with an amazing tech tree and unique units to each of the different civilizations. For me it's always the Britons being an English lad of course. Nothing beats an army of 50 elite longbowmen with heated shot (fire arrows) upgrade. Also the fun part about playing a skirmish against computer opponent is the fact that they always seem to launch premature strikes on your base as like a 'provocative strategic manoeuvre', when really all they end up doing is getting completely mauled by the little army of archers/foot soldiers that you have been obtaining (alternatively they can keep sending ungodly amount of troops somehow 5 minutes into gameplay when you're just building your 3rd house and got about 3 farms up and running, and then slaughtering and griefing your tiny little village). Regardless of that nonsense, when you've fortified your city with walls and built 7 billion castles around the edges with a couple of watch towers dotted in between, you can safely start to build your mahoosive army which you then take on one massive campaign and dominate the AIs. Alternatively, if you're a sh-i-te commander then you'll have to end up going out with an army and getting them all slaughtered and then having to spend out resources and building another one. On the bright side there are achievements on Steam for getting your own units killed (such an incentive I know!). There are awesome formation settings and attack stances that separate you (an organised battle tactician) from the computer AI (naked blue body painted savages that throw all of their units and resources away).  It's always so awesome looking at the end of scenario report and seeing your stats sky rocket above the rest of the players. As for online, I've never played online so find that out for yourself.  Buy this game immediately because of reasons and because of a unit called a Petard (I know right) that you train in a castle and it's basically a medieval suicide bomber.  20/10 - love this game"
Ensemble Studios plan for world takeover:   - Make one of the most classic games of all time as a sequel to a successful game   - Make a mediocre sequel to that sequel   - Decide to completely abandon IP that made them successful and make an uncalled for sci-fi RTS   - Go Bankrupt   - Wait exactly 1 Decade   - Make DLC for first game
"A classic game I played a lot as a kid. The HD version was done very well and it still feels like the game I played all those years ago just more up to date. For the life of me I always get my ♥♥♥ kicked in multiplayer though.  9/10 A must buy classic for anyone who played this as a kid, it's also easy to pick up and provides hours of fun for those new to the franchise/genre."
"A familiar face in the Real-Time Strategy genre, the re-release of Age of Empires II is a must have both for its grueling gameplay and nostalgia value."
This is a classic! For the kingdom! 
"Wonderful game, brings me back to years ago. One of the best RTS, requries skill, and teaches rather odd things about history, such as pickling holy roman emperers. good single player, multiplayer campain editor, and campains. is sometimes laggy though"
hours of fun.
"This 'HD' version is a farce, whoever developed this and throught this was ok- I spit on you. The multiplayer doesn't work. In a multiplayer game originally meant to work with 56k connections I get constant lag spikes and crashes."
The multiplayer mode tends to drop players and the saved games for multiplayer do not load as well.
"Still the same old game, Plus new, professionally done expansions! Great for competitive gameplay and/or nostalgia"
"Have you ever played Starcraft II?  Well I have, and if you have, this is just like it, but in a real world, age-progression style.  If you haven't, here's why I love it...  This game is like...I can't explain, this game is wonderful, from the workshop to DLC, this includes almost every aspect of strategy ever. Do you like watching as every last piece of life is destroyed within a civilization? Do you like seeing your civilization prosper economically? Are you a feminist? Do you think that guns are awesome, along with bows, spears, horses, swords, wagons, and elephants? If you answered yes to any of these questions, and have enough money to buy this game...Must I explain?"
why would you replace the meat icon with corn why would you change all the hotkeys around to make them more awkward 9/10 it's okay
" 6/10 for me.    Pros  Same old good game Easy for everyone Great Multiplayer (but buggy) Steam Workshop   Cons  Same old game (dont expect anything new) Random crashes to desktop Some achievements doesnt work Sound bugs alot FULL PRICE FOR AN OLD GAME (+Exp) It says HD, but are the same crappy old textures on higher resolutions. Buggy configs, no video configs.   If you are not sure on this game DONT BUY IT"
"Such a great game! It may be old, but it is a lot of fun. This game allows you to build up your 'empire' while fighting others.  In most matches you start off with a few villagers, a town center and maybe a few houses. Town Centers allow you to create villagers which mine, build, chop wood, farm/hunt/gather, fight (rarely), fish (sometimes) and repair. You can research new techs in certain buildings to improve your army, villagers, buildings, how fast things are created, etc. You can play on many different maps, choose how you can win or lose the game, choose from many different countries/cultures etc. Your army usually comes from barracks, stables, castles, archery range and the siege workshop. Your navy will come from the docks.   One of my favourite matches to play on it is the islands where everyone has their own island to start, regardless if they are allied with someone or not. It is like you have your own country and you must defend your island and then take down the enemy.   Overall I think this is a game many people should give a chance!"
this is a great game that you can play just for fun or play competetivly. you can easily put many hours into this game and still ejoy it. I recomend it to everyone.
Just like i remember  10/10  'Don't point that thing at me!'
"Best Game ever, played it since i was 3 years old xD"
10/10 for this classic game. Recommend for anyone
"I spent hours playing this game as a kid and over ten years later, I'm still thoroughly enjoying this game. I highly recommend it"
  One of the best classic RTS games you can get without compatability patches
"Fun game. If you enjoy RTS games, this is the game for you."
it is awsome if you got burned by ahem stronghold ugh 3 this is better at lest watch the trailer and then watch lets plays on youtube :D
You know what to do.
Nostalgic as ♥♥♥♥
This was my childhood. And my childhood was good.
Do you want a [g]old game? Try this. Now even with The Forgotten DLC which adds more civilizations/campaigns/game features. Goodluck hun on being the king of the hill &lt;3
"Seriously underated game, and totally worth $20"
Joined game with friend Rushed to kill me and i was like :O nooez Dies REMATCH Gets ingame Spawns hundreds of monkey things Sent monkeys to kill him The monkeys were OP and he got wrecked I won Went on to become best player in universe
"Epic game, a never dying classic."
seems like a cool game... havent played enough to really get the feel for it yet tho...
"I must admit, playing this game as a kid back in the day was one of the best things around. As a fan of strategy games I can promise you that this game just gets better and better with age.  There have been some tweaks and balances to some civilisations and units but the game hasn't majorly changed and is still awesome. If you can find it on sale it should be a no brainer, especially sice the multiplayer has been brought back to life. Yes you can play 4v4 or 6v6 or whatver you want with your frineds, and if you dont have friends dont worry! The AI is ridiculous and will surely provide a good challenge. 10/10 would monk army again"
First 5 mins of the game all you be hearin' is;  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO  SHHEE-HO
Wololo
"After playing this game since I was around 5 years old, I still play it now at 22!"
"A decent reworking of a classic and fantastic game. The graphical changes to the original are minimal, with the main improvements coming in the form of massive multiplayer changes. The multiplayer, though held back by bugs, is easy to use and fun.   As for the gameplay, it's not bettered by any other RTS game in my opinion.   My major critisism is that they tend to release bug fixes for the forgotten expansion before fixing the basic HD edition. They are also making gameplay changes (such as improved map editor) to the forgotten expansion which are not (yet) available for the HD edition. Hopefully they will not go down the line of turning the Legacy expansion pack into a gameplay changing DLC rather than the simple additional campaign that it should be."
One of the best strategy games of all time!
"This game is a timeless classic. Fun campaigns with great voice acting, active multiplayer scene even though its 10+ years old, and the developers keep working to make it better."
"Great game, fun to play. Lots of people still play online."
Greatest game from my childhood. Still the only RTS I will play; game is hard. Learn history while fearing the yellow man. 10/10
I never played this game when I was younger but my brother certainly did.  10/10 Would live my brother's childhood again.
One of thee best balanced RTS games out there to date. The HD edition is choice.
"Long time, no siege.  Woolooloo.  All Hail, King of the Losers!  Sure, blame it on your ISP!  Quit touching me!  Buy this just for the audio taunts, everything else is bonus."
Good Stuff!
Can't hate this game because of the nostalgia factor. One of the best strategy games ever developed.
Sick game!
"Ive been playing this game since i was about 7, its possibley the best strategy RTS alive and im glad they brought it to steam to share with a large population that has never seen age of empires 2. A simply must have for all command and conquer junkies &lt;3 trust me you love it"
Fought against the Koreans in a simple 1v1... regreted every bit of it as I found myself swarmed by hordes of Korean Wagons of Death... 10/10 for MLG PRO Death Wagons of Korea.
Best Strategy Game Ever Great 9.5/10
"Played for the nostalgia, but actually remembered I wasn't even good at the game. Still a great rts 10/10"
Old but gold. Sadly this remake doesn't fix any problems/bugs of the orginal one. Because of the improved compatibility with Windows 7/8 it's still worth buying during a sale.  7/10
would defently WOLOLOLOLOLOLOL again
"The most treasured RTS, AoE II HD preserves its nostalgic values while adding new civilizations into the fray.  This game doesn't just flat out put civilizations you can play as, but you get to know their history, which is a very nice touch.  Also, any accidental drops in ELO or MMR matchmaking systems are virtually nonexistent, unlike in AoM:EE. When your game crashes, you don't lose any ranking at all.  That being said though, this beautiful, well-crafted game only needs to maximize multiplayer security and robustness to fully ensure that every single minute you spend in multiplayer is just as good as playing the game yourself in singleplayer.  The new multiplayer system in servers have changed. Now there's two types of AoE II games that can be played; Original Game (Age of Kings + The Conquerors) and the Expansions (Original Game + The Forgotten + The African Kingdoms.) Servers can now choose to either host these two AoE II games. HOWEVER, if you join an Expansions server, you are stuck to a LIMITED pool of civilizations to choose from, unless you own the Forgotten, or the African Kingdoms. I highly recommend that you buy this game in addition with at least one expansion pack in order to prevent restricted options in multiplayer; the selection pool EVEN limits Age of Kings and Age of Conquerors civs.  Overall, it's a great RTS that shows historical values of the civilizations you play, providing the same, satisfying gameplay experience. However, it suffers from crashing in multiplayer games, and the fact that there's a limited pool of civilizations to choose from for people who join Expansions game servers, yet don't own any of the two expansions, hinders multiplayer experience for people who've already bought the original.  My favorite number is 30lololololol."
"Love this game, have always loved this game since I was a kid and my uncle owned it. I jumped at the opportunity to buy the HD Edition as soon I found it. It's a great starting game for anyone who wants to get into strategy games or a strategy veteran looking for a medieval pass-time. 10/10"
"Okay so, if you've played Age of Empires before and you liked it. I completely recommend this to you, it's a quite improved and actually, for 2014, playable version. The graphics got a boost, the AI, the multiplayer system, lot of tweaks and etc.  But don't expect a game that's completely in HD graphics, it stays close to its old graphics, and thats only  a good thing, atleast if you're in for nostalgia.    "
"This game, oh man this game. Just so you know, I'm a seasoned AoEII veteran. I've played it ever since it INITIALY came out in 1999. So bear that is mind.  Lets start up by comparing it to the original AoEII.  The base texture quality (Terrain, grass, snow, etc..) have not improved much. It still remain the same, but it still looks good if you ask me. There is no zoom option anyway so you can't study it real good anyway ;) But the water texture have been updates, infact it's been upgraded compleatly. In the original game, the water was just like the ground, plain and flat. But here it's 3D (At least it's animated). It make the water more 'Alive'. The Cliffs have also been updated from a brown desert like texture to a more gray stone color. Making it more neutral towards all types of maps (Desert, Grassland, Snow, etc...).  Other thinks that the HD verion have is a more or less inproved options menu and not to mention Widescreen support. Everyone who played the original AoEII knows it only supported letterbox (4:3). Now it support all screen resolutions and aspects, big + from me.  The addition of Steam Workshop, Steam Play (And Achivements) are a big big BIG welcome to all of us.  I have yet to toy around in the new Senario creator (If new at all). So no oppinion there.  I like that they raised the max selected unit from 40 to 50 and allowed more than 200 units pr player.  The fact that they added the Forgotten Empires mod in as a DLC was cool as well. 5 more civilisations, 4 new Campaigns , new map size, new Techs, Capture the Relic, Twitch streaming support and a propper spectator mode. Not to mention treaties, which in my oppinion will help new players agains't better players while they climb the ranks and earn there stripes. Only bad thing is that there is no voice acting in the new Campaigns, but that fine.  Now, there are some issue i still have with the game itself. The pathing is still kindof broken. If you click on a pre-explored part of the map, the units will walk the correct way instantly instead of doing it on the fly as they explore more of the fog of war.   Now, before you other veterans go buy this game. Remember that the system requirements have gone up quite a lot compared to the original. The graphical and memory requirements have gone up quite a lot (1 GB ram and 2 GB HDD). So be noted about that (Because I do get frame drops from time to time)."
Now if only they would port and/or redo the original AoE...
You can play f*cking ranked! amazing! 9/10 Best rts ever made.  I bought the 4 pack and a friend of mine too so we played togheter with 8 people big fun!
I loved this game since I started playing it like 11 years ago. I used to play it online with friends and we had a lot of fun. Now it's easier than ever to play online + Workshop with endless stuff to add + HD Textures + New campaigns
This game is the forefather of pretty much all modern RTS and even for an old game you can have hours of gameplay.  And wololo.
"This classic game is what started it all...Age of Empires II is the game that would be played at most LAN parties back in the day....endless hours of fighting, survival and finally glory! Epic battles, great gamplay, and the sprite graphics STILL look good! Microsoft did a fantastic job with this game, and it is pleasing to see that it is now updated and ready to be played on steam! This game is sure to entertain!"
"A very old school game, I remember losing hours of my day to this as a youngster. I still play again every now and then, I'm quite pleased they made a HD remake, It's a nostalgic game for some. If you played this when it first came out then I can guarantee you'll enjoy this once more!"
"I admit I haven't gotten around to playing much of this since I got it on Steam, but I played it a lot way back when. Excellent game, excellent update.   Age of Empires is like what would happen if you made Civilization into an RTS. You choose a civilization, then build and explore in typical RTS fashion. As you construct buildings and units, you can advance into technological eras, which give you more things to build and research. You can also contruct markets to trade with other cultures.   That about explains the concept of the game right there, it's a well-made RTS with a heavy Civilization influence.   This release, AoE2HD is interesting because this game was released and finished well over a decade ago, a sequel and spinoff were made, and it should have gone the way of most superceded games. Instead, it was revisited and remade, designed to work on modern computers and look good on today's HD monitors, with the expansion and additional content merged with the game, similar to Paradox's release of Majesty Gold HD. Unlike Majesty Gold HD, however, the update for AoE2 didn't stop at patching the game, development continues with a new expansion pack and active support.   Basically this is a case of a developer bringing a game back from the dead successfully, because of the devotion of the fans, and it is a rewarding and refreshing thing to see."
"Alfred the Alpaca voice acting is awesome 10/10  but all joking aside I strongly recommend this game, this game makes rebuying the same game really worth it (not like that last of us piece of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ that is the exact same game when they make a remastered version)  this game gives you: new graphics, new improved AI, Workshop content, great servers, new factions and lots of new possibility's. I went into the game and started a standard game with 7 different AI all in individual teams using the '-' in the team options. but of course with my brain I could only see as far as I can stretch my arm, thus forgetting to put the LOCK TEAMS on... yep! they al teamed me and kinda ♥♥♥♥ed me over. but i was astounded by this! never had the AI form AOE 2 used strategy before. usually they would have spammed every available unit they got. now they did exactly the same but this time the varied in a way that made the groups they sent more diverse. each different from the other. this time they actually countered what I was throwing at them. Example: I sent a group of Kamayuks (new spear unit from the inca's), and spear throwers. and what do they send? Champions and ballista's. so i sent a lot of Paladins (full tech tree option) to counter his Champions and to quickly eliminate the ballista's. And he sends Halberdiers! I loved this constant thinking of what to counter but your enemy always being one step ahead of you!  then i made my own map! I loved making fortress maps for me to defend againts the AI in AOE 2. but the strategy that the enemy uses is really hard to comprehend in this kind of situation. I always turn off the Trebuchets because I flipping hate those things. and then the enemy comes to the gate of my grand city! with siege rams, lots and lots of siege rams. so i send my Kamayuks outside to deal with them. and you'll probably guess what was in the rams.... Arbalests and Champions... he countered my Kamayuks just because I went scouting with one earlyer in the match.  This game has it all. HD graphics, great campaign, great AI, lots of options and a sense of nostalgia.. thank you Microsoft Studios (and all the other companies that I don't see just because I want to skip the video's in the begin and play my game) you made one of my favorite games come to life again. 11/10 it's awesome!"
Definitely a classic RTS. The Age of Empires series is what got me into strategy games and what got me into history actually. Age of Empires II offered a better variety to the strategy of how you can build your empire and take on multiple opponents. Although I did like the third entry to the series this one will alwas have a special place in my heart. Having played it for hundreds of hours (although you won't see that listed on Steam) I always find my self coming back to this game all these years later. Building up a fortresss (especially on the island maps) and setting out to conquer whatever opponents you face is very satisfying. If only Age of Empires III had the map sizes that this game had I would say it would be a close competitor but nothing beats the classics.
"This game was my childhood. I honestly thing it lives up to all it's fame. You don't see many games where the II is better than the III. The graphics are HD but pretty much the same with the original AOE II. The strategic aspect and multiplayer is pretty much the same as well. I am very glad because my original CD no longer works on Windows 10. If you liked this game as much as I did, definitely pick this version up."

"I used to play this game when I was 10 years old (or even younger, I can't really remember).  Well, 15 years later this game is still as enterteining as it used to be back then.   One of the few problems with old strategic games is that they look so damn old if you play them now. Luckly you don't really have this problem with AoE II HD (it happens with other very good games just like Warcraft III or Empire Earth). I would say the HD graphic it's kind of 'retro-oldish' but also 'newish' at the same time: a perfect compromise.  It's a shame they didn't add some new features, but even lacking new relevant updates this game is still amazing and can definitely compete with more recent titles.   If you're wondering 'is it really worth it to spend 20dollars for such an old game?' my answer is: you'd better wait for sales in order to get it for about 5 dollars, but man... the game is worth all the 20 damn bucks."
"Screw the bugs, non-existant community, and the few differences from the original! Buy it for the nostalgia-boner!"
"AOE 2 will forever secure it's spot at the top of RTS games. The HD edition looks great, can play in larger resolutions. Now we need dedicated servers! Get this game, get good, have fun."

"Much better than 3. And a soild classic that has gotten new DLC. I have sunk countless hours into this game when I still had it on disk back when I was still a kid then when I got it for Steam, I think I played this game for over a month straight.   Yes it doesn't have the newest graphics powered by the Unreal Engine but sometimes the best things in life are simple.   BTW old schoolers the new AIs are mean as ♥♥♥♥. So you will have to step up your game."
I've played this game for year's and it only gets better. Spent so much time on this game over the years and will never stop loving it!
"The best strategy game ever!. I played in this game since my childhood, and now it is remaster and the DLC which still keeping this game alive. It is just Amazing. I recommend this game for everyone who loves startefy games :)"
they afre still making expansions 18 years after the original release. that is how good this game is.

"Really, all that Skybox labs have done with the base game is add a coat of paint and make it compatible with modern versions of Windows... and that's all it needed.  The new expansions add new units and civilisations but as everything follows the same rules and structure of the base game, nothing feels forced or particually out of place. Put simply, it gives you a little bit more of what was great about Age of Empires II in the first place.   I bought this because I wanted to play AOE II without having to spend hours configuing it to run properly on new hardware and thats exactly what I got. It's pricy considering you can get the old gold eddition for next to nothing these days (and the forgotton empires mod for free on top of that) but really, I was happy to have it make an old but amazing game conveniant to play whenever I like again."
Same gold classics with well-polished textures. 8.5/10
Nothing beats a good old classic. Solid 5/7 ;)
Age of Empires Conquerors has already been one of my favorites and its refurbished version AOE II HD edition has just brought music to my ears !!! Cherry on the top are DLCs...... Waiting for next DLC to release...
History Teacher Simulator 1999
"One of the first games that got me into PC Gaming, remastered into HD and 64bit. Worth every hour spent on it."
The Beginner and the main stay of any true RTS gamer. Buy and show the world what you got. Try me......IM A KING
"This game is so fun and engaging that it actually puts you in a time bubble, and what felt like a half hour will have actually been 5 hours.  I missed days of school because I'd be playing the game, never looking at the clock (Probably didn't even blink) then my mom would walk in and be like 'Oh great, you're already up and ready for school?'.  '...Yeah... I'm up...'  Then I'd start walking to school, take a quick turn into the woods and wait until 8:30 when my mom left for work. Then I'd proceed home, pack a bowl, and play until I fell asleep on my keyboard. I probably did that exact thing, on average, 3 times a week.  I learned more from AoE, anyway.  10/10, This game is a must-have."
"A great improvement from the base game, recommend to everyone who likes strategy games! "
"They're still updating and releasing content a 17 year old game.  That amount of dedication earns a 10/10, even if the game happened to be crap. But that isn't even the case. This game is fantastic. It's a classic. This is what RTS should be.  If I could, 11/10."
"I played the very first edition demo of this on windows 98 when it was first released and still love it, 10/10 from me"
Used to be and still is one of my all time favourite games ever. Always entertaining and never many problems that are worth negating the rating.
A timeless masterpiece. I learnt so much from this game.
A little quick review cause I want that badge.  Fun game to play.   Good soundtrack  Unit strategy and countering is important.  Desync issues that can happen randomly. Developers have tried fixing but I don't know if it is fixed  Multiplayer with friends online or against bots.  Different playstyles dependning on what civilization you pick.  This game has a lot of things. These things stand out the most to me. I recommend this game
"For every person who rates this review as helpful I'll donate $1 to mental health institutions, to help the 7% of gamers who gave a negative review."
"This game brings back memories from when I first played it in 2002. This is an HD remaster. The game does show its age with some of the hotkeys and only being able to have 50 men in a group or selected at one. However, it is still worth getting. This game has new expansions that keep coming out. Two have come out this year and there is an active community. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an older school game that has been updated. I would rate this an 8.5 out of 10."
"I love this game, played it way back."
"It's really one of the classic map-based strategic games of the computer age thus far. One day it will be eclipsed, but for the moment, this game still has the power to hold the strategic gamer's attention.  Kudos to the independent entrepreneurs who have rejuvenated this game for higher-definition screens. Along with this comes expansions, campaigns, and features that effectively extrapolate upon what came earlier under Microsoft's creative tutelage.  Have the foresight and wisdom to recognize a classic, and make this game one of your 'must-play' computer gaming joys."
Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while. This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game. You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over. All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!
I have not found anything wrong with this game. I definitely recommend it.
Addictive classic
Hands down best strategy game ever. I love it and 95% of all other people will easily fall in love with it.
"There is quite a lot of gamers at the moment which are giving biased or very unhelpful reviews for people who want to pick up the game but are unsure. So im here to give an honest and moderatley helpful review for you.  The game is the same old game you love, there isnt anything new or fancy or shiny which is going to change your game expirience for the better or worse, its exactly the same as it was 12 years ago and by god this is one hell of a game. I had played two hours with a friend and it was one of those games which you love from the start, yet i wont go into the gameplay because its exactly the same as before.  The only new additions is some polishing of the graphics, everything seems a lot higher resolution as before but nothing which is eye candy. Infact the textures have been increased only very slightly, I felt that they could of done more work on polishing the textures and improving the very linnear and laggy animations, even if you loved the original animations it wouldnt of hurt to have smooth 60fps animations.  This is not the only problem the game suffers from, constant network problems and low framerates seems to be quite common, yet you should remember the game isnt released yet and im sure the developers will get patching.  The resolution is now much higher than before its running at 1080P, which is where the 'High Definition' comes from yet this is only the resolution and the actual base texures are defiantly not at 1080P. The game now allows for multiple monitors so you can strech your game over 2, 3 or 4 monitors.  The main problem here is you cannot fine tweak any resolution options. The text isnt in pure HD it seems and some elements of the game still feel like they are 12 years old.  The game is now using the Steam API system so you can join friends and play, from what I have tested this works perfectly yet a lot of people are complaining with problems with network lag.  Maybe the most anticipated feature is the game is fully supported with Steam Workshop meaning modders will start modding and creating new content for the game and you can subscribe at a click of a button.  In general its the same old game you love, but I feel that this is not a remake to me it feels as if the game is the exact same apart from a quick resolution change and the new Steam Features. If you loved Age of Empries II and want to relive the memories then this game is for you but don't expect a completly new game or anything to look too much better or smoother.  Gameplay - 9/10 (Same old, same love). Graphics - 6/10 (Feel they could of worked more on this and had a bit more options to change resolutions and animations) Performance - 3/10 (The game still has a lot of lag issues, FPS and Network, but I hope this will be fixed up)  Overall - 7/10 (If you are a fan of Age of Empires you will love this, Just don't expect to much from a simple remake of the game)"
10/10 will steal all the Relics before my 'friend´s' again.
"Whilst this wasn't the first RTS I've played, it led the way into online gaming for me for years to come. This game kept me up late hours during my high school years, always wanting to do one more Castle Wars or heck, a standard game. Age of Empires II stands the test of time, and the HD edition brings forth a new generation of players to play with/against.   The game involves, like most standard RTS games, the use of building and advancing your city, gathering resources, and the fun part, training soldiers to go to war. Each match feels fresh, different from the last, and with so many civilizations and strategies you can attempt, the possibilities are endless. Each civilizaion has its own unique set of units, and overall, it's fairly balanced. Even the cheaper units have their uses against the stronger ones if used correctly.   The maps all unique and based on preference. I like larger terrain maps, less use of sea combat, but even the ships have their pros and cons and fit in with the layout of Age of Empiqres. A standard game involves going through four ages, from the Dark Age all the way to the Imperial Age. But you always have to stay on your toes because you never know what the opponent's strategy will be. There's many different playstyles, such as those that like to rush units to take an early lead, or those who prefer a slower paced game and building their economy to advance through the ages quicker. Whatever the case, Age of Empires II is a must-buy for RTS fans, and hell, I'd say it's worth trying with non-RTS gamers, too."
Whether you're interested in singleplayer mayem or multuplayer madness or even just some casual campaign Age of Empires is great.
Hands down best strategy game ever. I love it and 95% of all other people will easily fall in love with it.

Not gonna say much: Game of my childhood which is as great as it was back in a day. 
"I think I last played AoE around... 10 years ago? And to this day it's still so addictive, I don't even really play RTS's.  Gorgeous graphics and art, now in high resolution. Complex but easy to learn. Lots of systems in play, strategies, and counters. All the satisfaction of micromanaging and building your own empire, and conquering others (or getting slammed). Well balanced and great for competitive play. New DLC for the game after a decade."
"Just as good as when it first came out but with more stuff and modding capability, easily the best AOE too and a blast from the past for how real games should be."
Simply one of the best RTS ever. Play now as I played in 97. totally recommend!
"All time classic, greatly recommend."
Hard to vote any other game than AoE2 for The “Test of Time” Award. Still being improved with a refined gaming mechanic.

"The success to the very first RTS title I ever played – Age of Empires – AOE II is an evergreen title that promises oodles of entertainment for countless hours. Honestly, I've lost count of the number of time I've finished the campaigns in AOE II and the Conqueror's Expansion. And with the HD remake, I can go back to playing this beautiful game all over again.   Byzantines for life!"
One of the best old school RTS game.
Can't reccommend this game enough.
My all time favourite strategy game -&gt; 'test of time' award :)
"Age of Empires .. a classic 90's i play since 2005, it was my first game, first love, and it will always stay in my heart &lt;3"
"The Best Game Ever Made  A game everyone should have in their games library! On steam or on the shelf.  Is a true RTS, a Classic."
"Classic game of my childhood, now in HD."
A game where you can go into another person's neighborhood and steal their turkeys.

One of the best rts in the world.
so nastalgic ahhhhh can I have my steam archievement now?
this game sucks!  wololo  this game is awesome!
Best RTS ever. Been playing since 2000.
Step1- play with friends Step2- steal their gold Step3-???? Step4-profit
Age of Empires II. What can i say....   Having played a total of 2 hours i feel i am very much entitled to an opinion of this game. In short it's a masterpiece. A gold coin in a pile of silver coins in the strategy genre.   The first time i played this game i went the mongols. I realised about 5 minutes in that there seemd to be an increase in the number of AI enemy soldiers in my base. To my horror i realised the enemy had built a barracks in my base and it was spurting out fresh soliders by the minute.   Best game ever   11/10   (Edit: Stil Best Game ever with an active community)
Fantastic game. As fun now as it was when it was new.. you know... back in 1999. The updates/dlc that have been added are fun and make it feel like it wasn't from... you know already.
Best game ever  10 wololo / 10 wololo
"After all the screwing around rick-rack,  I whispered in her ear,  bwahahahaha"
"This game man.. I think anyone who plays RTS's has least tried Age of Empires. I remember growing up and playing this and only this on my potato computer back when I was still in grade school. Good memories, and im glad that this game isn't dying any time soon, nor should it. This game is an example of why I play games today."
 10/10
"great game. easy to play, hard to master."
"Its Age of Empire and and AoE happens to be my favorite RTS game of all time. If you are an RTS fan I highly recommend it but if you played age of empire in the past and not intrested in the the forgotten expansion the game doesnt offer too much new things, this was the laziest remaster I ever saw. Hell, I only bought it because I wasn't able to fix the graphical problems in my original copy of age of empire and was slightly intrested in the forgotten expansion.  For people who care about ratings/numbers  This game gets 8.5/10 And is definetly worth the 20$ price if you are intrested"

"It really is amazing how this game got a second lease on life. Twitch integration, a graphical makeover, Workshop mod support, improved (albeit still kind of laggy) multiplayer, not to mention  new expansion packs  more than seventeen years after its initial release.  It's a deserving game, too. Age of Empires II is a classic historical RTS with rock-solid, foundational gameplay. This re-release also boasts improved AI though, so it's even more of a challenge, albeit I wouldn't say it approaches Korean Starcraft-level speed. It won't run on computers that the original edition would due to the increased graphical load, unfortunately, but if you were planning on playing this game seriously you probably already have a good computer.  If you feel like you can measure up, or if you just have nostalgia about leafing through the included encyclopedia of medieval life while desperately punching your way through the campaigns, I'd absolutely recommend this."
10/10 will steal all the Relics before my 'friend´s' again.
"Playing it for more than 15 years... I would say yeah, I recommend it XD"
"An amazing RTS game, true to the classic. Does have several flaws  -Online still as buggy as ever  - Skirmish AI very predictable"
Awesme new graphix and good if you are a fan of medival war! :D
"I would not recommend this game unless it goes on 75% off or higher. It had a lot of issues at launch, and still doesn't work too well.  I get lower FPS in this game than I get in ultra settings in Starcraft 2, the mouse seems to be laggy when you box over units. The unit AI is weak, villagers constantly getting stuck here and there when they're trying to pathfind their way to their workstation.  Online isn't exactly perfect, as it relies on peer to peer for the actual matches, and even with a ping of 30 in between you there's still input lag. A lot of input lag. It feels unresponsive, even pressing the Build -&gt;X building hotkeys too fast means you won't slect said building at all.   The game's terrain and water looks way better than the original game, but the units still use the same sprites, even on 1920 x 1080.   Buy it cheap or just buy Starcraft."
"Oh yeah, just the way I remember it. The graphics have been improved, but the game play is still kind of clunky. Ultimately, I think I liked Rise of Nations better. Same overall RTS game play, but better interface. But for an old game this thing still has a lot of playability."
"I entered a 4v4 match with my friends, four of us against four AI on the hardest difficulty. Within 0.5 seconds I had 7 billion people descending on my town while I had 100 of each resource and 2 villagers. Through tears I begged for help as my friends ignored me and continued to build their armies and defences, enriching their own lives as their most valuable and cherished friend turned to rubble. I switched sides last minute by destroying all my defensive walls and allowing the AI armies to flank my friends, bypassing the long route through my burning city. Friends kicked me from the voice chat we had open and refuse to play with me.   Greatest game of all time, and always will be. The HD textures are pointless when you're blinded by the tears of betrayal anyway. 10/10"
"An amazing RTS game, true to the classic. Does have several flaws  -Online still as buggy as ever  - Skirmish AI very predictable"
So many different civilations that you will certainly find one that fits you.  Different mechanics that all affect a play style. Wanna build boats? Naval conquest is possible. Want to focus on production for your teammates? You can organize trades and do that. Want to build an army of 200 crossbowmen? Go right ahead.
Is this a classic? Yes it is Is the HD remake a good remake? Yes it is Did the DLC expansions screw some things up? Yes they did Are the new DLC pretty damn cool? Sure are Is the game still a good game? Very much so
A classic. Great for multiplayer with friends.
great game. classic game in my eyes. well worth the money 
This has always been one of my favourite games E V E R. Got it when I was a child with my first computer but not the HD version so I had to buy this one. Still AWESOME.

"Playing it for more than 15 years... I would say yeah, I recommend it XD"
"First game I ever watched my dad play and the first game I ever played. Game is truely a masterpiece. If there was steam back in 1999 id have 150,000 hours. Enough of the bias... the game is great id recomend it to anyone who wants to play a classic RTS updated for modern computers."
"I have forgotten how nice this game is. Started playing to just get the feeling of this game back, but ended up player for HOURS. Loving it!  The HD version gives one the ability to play on the bigger Screens, but its still very pixilated - was hoping for a little bit more."
Absolutely a timeless game. I've played it on and off ever since I was so young that I can't even remember how young I was &amp; it's as good every time you come back to it.
"Relive your past! Amazingly, the developers that put this remake together didn't screw anything up! It's the same AoE we all know and love but it really takes advantage of everything steam has to offer. The workshop, trading cards, achievments, and a much better multiplayer system really cement this as one of the best remakes I have ever played in my life. Highly recommended to anyone who like the original AoE 2."
 Age of Empires II HD Edition
"An absolute classic that's stood up to the test of time. I remember playing this game as a kid and the nostalgia I felt when I played it once again was astounding. This is, in my opinion, the king of RTS games. This is the game that keeps me coming back when I'm in the mood for an RTS.   10/10"
"Age of Empires II... what's not to like? This was my absolute favourite game in my early teens, even though - when I look back at those times - I sucked at the game and mostly played the excellent campaigns. Joan of Arc, Genghis Khan, Frederick Barbarossa, Saladin... I could still play through these campaigns while blindfolded.  Now that the game has been re-released in HD, I'm playing it in multiplayer, and it's great fun. It took me a while to learn the proper strategies, because if you want to survive in multiplayer, you have to be efficient - proper build orders, never stop building villagers, etc. The game requires a lot of skill to play and learning how to beat your opponent is very rewarding. There are just so many ways to approach this game, it offers a lot of variety.  About the game itself: it's a typical RTS where you build your base, harvest resources, and train an army to destroy your enemy's base. And it is very, very well-made, to this day one of the best titles in the genre, in my opinion. Most games start out in the Dark Age, where you have few buildings available and can only train weak militia units, and you 'age up' to the Feudal Age, Castle Age, and finally Imperial Age, with each age unlocking new buildings, units, and technologies. Every playable civilization has its own unique bonuses, unique technologies and unique units. The British have the longbowman, for example, and the Teutons have the Teutonic Knight, a heavy infantry unit. While the tech tree is similar for each civ, they still play differently thanks to their unique units, techs and bonuses, although not as differently as in Starcraft or Age of Mythology.  If you're not into multiplayer and prefer singleplayer, don't worry: the campaigns are quite excellent, and AoE2 HD comes with the Conquerors expansion, so you have a large amount of campaigns to play through. William Wallace (a tutorial campaign), Joan of Arc, Saladin, Genghis Khan, Frederick Barbarossa, and in the expansion: Attila, El Cid, Montezuma, and a collection of historical battles. Mission goals in the campaigns are varied and it never feels repetitive, and some missions are very, very challenging, like the final mission of the Saladin campaign.  One minor note of complaint: the multiplayer sometimes has issues, but they've become a little better with the latest patch. Still, in large matches of 3v3 or 4v4 you will often experience lag, and sometimes you will even get out-of-sync errors, so beware. 1v1 matches work flawlessly though and I never had a problem in a 1v1 game. If you like team games, do keep this in mind though.  Overall, a thorougly recommended game. I enjoyed the heck out of this when I first played it in 1999 as a young teen, and I'm enjoying the heck out of it now in competitive multiplayer matches."
"The epitome of classic RTS!  While the graphics and UI are extremely dated from today's perspective, the gameplay is still as fun as it was when it was first released back in 1999. Fun and strategic while still being laid back; this title (along with Starcraft) is one of the first successful RTS, and it's not hard to see why it spawned so many clones. If the idea of building a medieval city, controlling an army and ultimately conquering your neighbors sounds fun to you, this is the game to do it in.  It reaches the ideal level of abstraction for an RTS, staying arcadey and fun while keeping the flavor of the middle ages with a minimum of minutiea. The Age series as a whole is amazing, and this is the seminal title of the series.  Also, the Forgotten is well worth it, but wait for a sale.  Score: Objectively: 8/10  Personally: 9/10"
Converting a boat to christianity  -11/10 would wololo again
This game is a great remaster of the classic Age of Kings. It seems to work well on modern hardware and the graphics are significantly improved on widescreeen and at higher resolutions. Also like the larger map size and population limit options.
"Down a shot of nostalgia with this unregrettable purchase as you indulge in times of youth long passed. Alas, the fun ends when you attempt any form of multiplayer, lest you don the cloak of basementhood and fight among the echelons of the tactically enlightened. This RTS is THE definitive experience when it comes to PC gaming, and will likely serve as a Rosetta Stone to future civilizations, looking back upon this golden age of gaming in humanity."
Great game! Brings back so many memories :).
"Age of Empires is a classic middleaged RTS, the new HD Edition added a new reworked multiplayer system that worked without hamachi. The reworked singleplayer is untouched only adding new and better graphics. If you decide to play multiplayer then you may play ranked or unranked starting with an elo of 1600 in ranked. The game is rather recource oriented like starcraft, exept the major materials are wood, food, stone and gold, each holding a decisive role in the middleage game. In the beginning of each match you start with a towncenter and 3 villagers, these can build buildings and gather recources and the towncenter can produce villagers and provides other upgrades like a number of other buildings which require recources. The game supports a number of playstyles as a player you have the option to defend yourself and advance through the four times: Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age to defeat your enemy, turtling your way to victory or you can rush your enemy. The game features a variety of civilizations which have different attributes &amp; which allow an even more free playstyle.  I used to play the oldest version of the game, in which the ai was extremly unbalanced on a more intermidiate level. To my suprise alot of extrem fans of the franchise play the game frequently, so its hard to improve if you play against pros all the time, thats why I would recommend this game to a bunch of friends when its on sale, since the game itself is extremly enjoyable, but to reach a competitive level you require an extrem amount of patience and practise like in any game, which I myself did not have. I lack a profound devotion to master this game but maybe you have it. As a horrible player who only plays with friends, I would give this game a 8/10 it has extrem potiential for new players, but you get destroyed if you dont know how to play this complex game."
An extremely fun refresh of the classic game. Stretches admirably over a five-monitor array. 5/5 would play again.
I would play this game for hours when I didnt have internet years ago
"I love it, i'm still good as the old days :)!"
AOE II HD is a classic and worth time spent enjoying muti-players gaming.
"This game was very helpful coz there were alot of people next door at a out of control party, I was able to stop them all because i had learned how to micro very good. Even one of my other neighbours came up to me the next day and said I did good."
It's AGE OF EMPIRES 2  If you liked it back in the 90's you're gonna like it now.
You get to overwork hundreds of people and then kill them and their families. 11/10
Classic RTS goodness. Gameplay as good as ever. Definitely recommended
"This game is 'HD' compared to...say... Pong, however for those of us whom grew up with this series the gameplay trumps any graphical interface."
Playing this makes me feel 10 years younger again! Great fun both in single and multiplayer.
"love this game when I was a kid, it was my favorite game, and now it still.personally the one of the best Microsoft Product of all time(another one is Windows)"
Amazing game. I love the update for the graphics. An awesome remake of a classic
"Yup, this is old good Age Of Empires II ! You must buy it, if you love AOE series."
An impressive remake of an ancient game. While yes there is still some issues about the game the dev's are continually working toward cleansing as many bugs as possible. A strategy game of epic proportions that requires intense concentration and quick skills to balance your army management and your economic management. This game will force you to think about everything and be looking everywhere on the map in an effort to evade your opponent and overwhelm him at the same time.  9/10 because of the bugs.
i started playing this game when i was 7...still playing it 10 years later. A timeless masterpiece. 10/10
"If you've played Age of Empires II before (and enjoyed the experience), you're going to absolutely adore the HD Edition. New campaigns, easily accessible multiplayer, and mods from the Steam Workshop make it well worth its price. Personally, I've spent countless hours in online scenarios alone. The few, insignifigant gripes I do have with it lie with its multiplayer."
"Do you smell that? That's a smell. That kind of smelly smell..that smells....Like childhood. Yes, this game is the hour consuming, family depriving, and hermit provoking game that made part of my childhood amazing. This game is not exactly the 'Hd' everyone was hoping to be when it was announced, but frankly Scarlett, I don’t give a damn! This is by far the best RTS game out there even after almost a decade of its time. The campaign is amazing with a fantastic tutorial, and the battle of the online civilizations is so much fun. Battle it out against the great empires and watch your opponent fall to your infantry, cavalry, or medieval artillery. You will spend hours on end away from your worrying family to play this history grade saving game. "
"HD nostalgia, if you've played this when it came out a hundred years ago, play it now!"
Just the greatest RTS of all-time. 10/10  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKeULI-v9es 
"This game was originally released October 1997. I played it then and surprisingly I'm still playing it, and it's still fun.   Most of the games coming out today, they're fun when they're new, but get boring and then you never want to play them again. This one has managed to keep my interest. And there's very few that can do that."
Great game
Age of Empires is my childhood and I also love this HD edition but it keeps crashing too much and there is no autosave to save my backside many times :c I recommend it anyways but crashes are annoying.
"Do you like RTS games? If you do, you need to have this game in your collection. A great remake of AOE2 with improved graphics, and now has dlc which adds a bunch of new content. The game is just as you remembered it, build up your base, build an army and destroy your enemy. Lots of different game modes, lots of maps and heaps of different civilizations to choose from.  If you are fan of RTS games then buy this now."
"Your mum liked this game when i was round at hers, we didn't play much of it tho...if ya get what i mean ;)"
"Ensemble's finest RTS. Most Ensemble RTS's focus on resource management, factions specialities, and base/civilaztion building. AoEII HD looks great with the higher resolutions offered and the texture packs you can mod in. The game civilizations are diverse and all the units are fun to work at. There is no better feeling than building up a diverse army of knights, pikemen, archers, cannons, and seige weapons and wiping your enemies off the face of the Earth.  "
I like how you can be different nations.
"The best Strategy game that will make every SECOND count ... Very simple ,, Easy to grasp gameplay   10/10 in terms of fun  2/10 in graphics &gt;&gt;&gt; 1999 game BTW"
Wololo.  Now you must play this game. Welcome to my team.
"Its Age of Empires 2 in HD, what more do you want me to say? The game is a classic and can still be played in this day and age."
Would be fun if Ranon played with me...
"I love rome 2 now that its fixed, anyways It seems everyone loves this game except the people who are mad at it being a cheap remake, AKA for more money, end of the line its a great game, but do your research on which community you want to get into voobly, steam. Voobly is more competetive, and steam is more streamer friendly and built in, there may be some bugs but the gameplay is so wonderful I have to give a positive rating.   *Original* Top 5 Strategy Games EVER, I would put it at number 1 ♥♥♥ u rome total war!"
"This game was my childhood, it does not need a review, it's amazing must buy. The games graphics are out dated (obviously) but if you can see past that it is probably my favourite game of all time."
"This game has long been a childhood favorite. It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC. I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite. For those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one. A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community."
"Since patch 4.4 (2 months ago) my game became unplayable and the reason is the HUGE LAG. Of course they can't make the game work correctly in 2 months. Of course they can't. You had to screw up the game, didn't you?"
"Back with a vengance. If you liked the original AoE, you'll love this."

it gave me a excitement and a lot of drama

Great game! Brings back so many memories :).
"160+ hours so far and I still suck.  In my opinion, the greatest RTS game of all time."
Converting a boat to christianity  -11/10 would wololo again
This game is a great remaster of the classic Age of Kings. It seems to work well on modern hardware and the graphics are significantly improved on widescreeen and at higher resolutions. Also like the larger map size and population limit options.
"This game is the proof that the big companies are trying to suck our moneys by doing low quality products copying ancient classics and selling it to us without any new features.This game doesn't contain any new features,without the expansion,other than the workshop availability.But i do recommend it.I had a heck of a time playing it with my friend.The game does conserve the fun of the ancient game but with a bit better graphics and lots of servers to play multiplayer.I recommend this game because at the end of the day what mathers is if you had fun,and this game is very good at it."
"If I had to describe this game in a brief sentence I would say 'It's an assclap of the gods.'. This game delivers solid gameplay using units, upgrades and mustang car cheats that only little ♥♥♥♥♥es use when they can't win because i spam jihadis and war elephennts. It also features an extensive history on the civilizations such as when the japense tusseled with the vikings in texas (no not the sports team you burn out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and dont say you're not i know you are because you play steam.) another feature that kind of sucks but whatever is the map editor i enjoy making anime then battling the romans on it dont tell anyone though they'll think im gay for liking naruto. well gtg grandma just made sum chicken pot pie."
Great game! Brings back so many memories :).
"Down a shot of nostalgia with this unregrettable purchase as you indulge in times of youth long passed. Alas, the fun ends when you attempt any form of multiplayer, lest you don the cloak of basementhood and fight among the echelons of the tactically enlightened. This RTS is THE definitive experience when it comes to PC gaming, and will likely serve as a Rosetta Stone to future civilizations, looking back upon this golden age of gaming in humanity."
"Age of Empires is a classic middleaged RTS, the new HD Edition added a new reworked multiplayer system that worked without hamachi. The reworked singleplayer is untouched only adding new and better graphics. If you decide to play multiplayer then you may play ranked or unranked starting with an elo of 1600 in ranked. The game is rather recource oriented like starcraft, exept the major materials are wood, food, stone and gold, each holding a decisive role in the middleage game. In the beginning of each match you start with a towncenter and 3 villagers, these can build buildings and gather recources and the towncenter can produce villagers and provides other upgrades like a number of other buildings which require recources. The game supports a number of playstyles as a player you have the option to defend yourself and advance through the four times: Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age to defeat your enemy, turtling your way to victory or you can rush your enemy. The game features a variety of civilizations which have different attributes &amp; which allow an even more free playstyle.  I used to play the oldest version of the game, in which the ai was extremly unbalanced on a more intermidiate level. To my suprise alot of extrem fans of the franchise play the game frequently, so its hard to improve if you play against pros all the time, thats why I would recommend this game to a bunch of friends when its on sale, since the game itself is extremly enjoyable, but to reach a competitive level you require an extrem amount of patience and practise like in any game, which I myself did not have. I lack a profound devotion to master this game but maybe you have it. As a horrible player who only plays with friends, I would give this game a 8/10 it has extrem potiential for new players, but you get destroyed if you dont know how to play this complex game."
Ignore my playtime. I was playing this on CD before Steam even existed. If you like RTS games and you haven't played this by now you should be ashamed of yourself!
"Great game, really brings me back to the good old days when these games was all we thought about."
"What can I say, this game is a timeless classic alongside C&amp;C which paved the way for real time strategy games on the PC. If you are a true gamer you should definitely play this and get hooked on it :D I know I did ! Highly recommended !"
Classic rts. Really good still but doesn't hold up too well. Unit pathing for example is horrendous. Only recommended for those looking to specifically play an old rts or for nostalgia.  Does still have a competitive scene   Soundtrack is amazing
"One of the best RTS to exist. Hands down, this game has stood the test of time. Released in 1999 and is still regarded one of the best to play here in 2016. Well worth for $20, if it's anything cheeper it's practically a steal."
"I really like the game. Always played the original version of DVD. The HD is not really something special but the multiplayer support works good. It's much better than GameRanger. Although I think the game is okay, it's not worth the 20 euro. Better wait for a sale again. I got AOE2 + DLC and AOE3 complete edition for 7,50 euro."
Great meme!
"This game is a classic. Possibly the most memorable game from my childhood. If you haven't already played you can probably guess its a base builder rts. Gather resources create buildings make units, and destroy the enemy. Simple but elegant this game was popular for a reason.  The re-release Implementing steamworks into the game is pretty awesome. Just Invite your freinds straight to your game and kill some computer controlled civilizations or team up and take on some other players. Having this game with the workshop gives you access to the dedicated modding community with ease. With the community made expansion you can play some new single player campaigns, or if you're just into multiplayer there are new game modes and civilization that add some fresh content to this classic piece of 90s gaming gold."
"Bought this when I saw it on sale but I cant get it to run, the launcher comes up  I hit play and nothing happens.   I have asked steam for a refund, but would rather have the game wich is a shame, I loved this game back in the day.."
Still the best real time strategy game out there. Would be nice if it worked on Linux and OSX out of the box.
recently 98% positive feedbacks Nothing to add (y)
Still my favorite strategie game since 16 years. Recommend this great game! Makes even more fun with friends online.

"Don't waste your money on this garbage if you like good old RTS gameplay. Go buy Empire Earth 2 instead. Age of Empires 2 is basically a mediocre version of Empire Earth 2 missing 95% of the features and content, but instead you have to pay two times the amount for it. Do yourself a favor and spend your money wisley, don't touch this game- for the sake of your sanity."
"Is good, but they need to fix the restore saved multiplayer, which does not work. I have bought two copies, one for me and other for my son, when the multiplayer crashes after ours of play there is no way to get that working again. I was searching the internet and this is happening since 2013. And now you release a DLC? Come on, fix the multiplayer restore and not come with more expansions. Step larger than the legs."
"Age of Empires II is disputably the greatest RTS game ever made. The sheer variety of maps, units, technologies, and playable civilizations make it a force of its own, but the game attains premier status with its incredible map/scenario making tool, a killer campaign, well-balanced gameplay, and generous catering to multiple play-styles. Age of Empires II: HD Edition is not a remake, but merely a rerelease with a few changes, including widescreen support. Neverthless, the release was long overdue, and it is the one of the games I am most happy to have in my Steam collection. Disclaimer: this review is also for 'The Forgotten' expansion pack.    The Good:    * Incredibly huge game with near-perfect gameplay and virtually timeless game mechanics. Many features of newer games are a tad hard to replicate, such as auto-explore,(hold shift to create waypoints then click on your map all over), but the game othwerise stands up to the test of time quite well.  * Units, when grouped together, create tactical formations to your specifications. AOE2 was the first game to do this, and no game has yet done it so well as AOE2.   * Greatly expanded and updated multiplayer options, including the treaty mode which gives a huge advantage for 'turtle' players, a population limit of up to 500, and automatic ELO online rankings.  * Steam Workshop support with active modding community, including HD texture packs.    The Bad:    * Online multiplayer has noticeable but acceptable lag.  * The achievements are WALLS of text that do not fit into Steam's mouse-over UI when checking on achievement progress. Here is an example of one of the longer achievements: 'Over one hundred of your units were lost in this battle - even with such great losses, if they were well used against the enemy you did the right thing. Get used to studying the battle stats after each match with an opponent - did you have the right complementary mix of units? Did you make your enemy pay for every one of your losses? Every unit sacrificed is an opportunity to learn about your opponent.'  * I encountered a potentially serious bug where everyone's name switched to '[unknown]' and we all had to navigate by player-color. Chatting was very difficult.  * The game is not FULLY steam compatible. The F12 key, which should take screenshots for Steam, loads the 'save game' menu. This makes taking in-game screen-shots an annoyance.  * No 'military drag' feature, which allows you to select a group of units EXCEPT for villagers. This was first introduced in AOE3.    The Ugly:    * The game had a horribly messy launch which gave many people a bad first impression. Most bugs and glitches have since been fixed.    The verdict:    * This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoyed the game when it was still in its hey-day. If you have not played it before, you may consider waiting until it is on sale (it is on sale for the worthy price of $14.99 at the time of this writing)."
"Windows 8 user here. I like this expansion if it ran well i would recommend it to everyone. Unfortunately it doesn't. 1) It runs really slow on black forest, given enough units it becomes unplayable  2) It has some bugs, the idle villager button doesn't work properly and on occasion i'd hear the sound of a farm being depleted at which point the villager working on that farm stops collecting but the crop itself is still there. "

Multiplayer alone I think that says it all with 2 friends jep 174 hours. And I am not type of person that gets hook up easily on most of games. Get it if you have to play with somone or you want to wreck somones face off online....

"The true winner of the 'Test of Time' award. Let's be honest. 5 years, bugs, a overpriced cash grab vs. 17 years, new affordable DLC, HD remake &amp; still thousands of players.."
Eight of us are gathered for a night of out of sync errors. This game was much more stable 10 years ago.
"Classic game, but don't pay more than $5."
"This game is good, if you are looking for age of Empires 2 and dont have the original. Its not really HD, only things like fire and water look any diffrent. Its really the same game as the original with just 2 things in its favor. 1, the online works on this version but has been discontinued on the original. 2, they have the workshop on this game so you can get some graphic overhaul mods and stuff. If you dont have the original you should go ahead and get it. If you do have the original, wait till thres a sale and the price goes down (went to $5 during fall sale), try and get some friends to get it with you and its ll be well worth your money."
"This game is awesome, just as i remember it all those many moons ago."
"The trailer states that Age of Empires II defined an age. Well, in my case, it's actually quite true. Even more so than Total Annihilation (that I was offered at the same time), AoK is among my favorite RTS games. The fact that I was already an History nerd probably helped, but the game was nonetheless a very slick RTS.  The gameplay was very basic - peasants gather resources and build stuff before you go to war -, but everything was very well done, and it implemented a lot of cool mechanics, like garrisoning units inside castles. Overall, let's say I have very fond memories of AoK: I loved the single player campaigns - despite the WTFHISTORY moments - and playing it in LAN with my brother and friends.  That being said, do I recommend this HD edition? It's hard to say. The game is still as good as it was and, unlike Empire Earth 1 &amp; 2 and their somewhat basic 3D, AoK graphics aged pretty well. But, as far as HD goes, it's pretty much inexistant. Thank god, you can have a decent, recent resolution. Thank god, you don't have to use some computering shenaningans to make it work on Windows 7. Apart from that... There's the steam workshop, which is nice, even though there is, so far, not a lot of content on it, map and scenario-wise. There's apparently some remade water HDish texture (didn't notice it). There are some new bugs, and some old ones haven't been fixed...  All in all, I find the price tag to be set way too high for such an old game, with so little apparent update. 19€ + expansion is overpriced. Too bad Age of Empires II is still a great game, because if you liked it back in the 2000's, or want to try this classic, the HD version is as good as you'll get. And is regularly updated. So, my final piece of advice is: wait for a sale and get it (*). It's unlikely you will regret it.  * Unless you're rich, in which case, go ahead and buy it now. Then send me a check."
"I used to play this on the original disk before i got steam.   Now i wonder why I even bought the disk version Two expansions only available on steam, mods, achievements and a ton of really cool new stuff!!!!!!!  I definitely recommend buying this game and both its expansions Buy them!!! You won't regret it!"
this game is gret with friends if u have sum

"I was enjoying the game, (look at my time, that's one session) but then an update had to come in, and since then, I've been unable to play at all. The launcher comes up, but once you click 'play', it immediately goes into 'not responding' and you can't do anything about it with any other results. If it actually worked, then I'd suggest it at a decent price, but since it doesn't work anymore, I'd say find something else."
"This Game is truly a history in the making. The Age of Empires Franchise is outstanding being the start of the Strategy Genre. AOE 2 really made its toll as a game as now it's been remastered, it really can't get any better. What makes this game so good is a number of things. To start of the gameplay is great. There is a key manging that you have to do to achieve a large army, a stable amount of resources and golden tunnel to victory. It does not match the Mangement of CIV 5 but there's a big difference with both of the games (but lets not go into that). The Graphics may not match most other strategy games like Company of Heores 2 and StarCraft but I think that's what makes it an AOE game in it's own sense. With the huge armies and big variations of units fighting this game really makes combat fun. When playing this game like most strategies you have to think carefully and plan your road ahead, you will come to do this alot with AOE2. Plan who to attack, plan what you are going to do with your first villagers so it requires alot of thinking but theres no harm in that.   You have the choice also to pick a huge variety of factions to play. Each faction is unique in its self for example: the Byzantines to having a STRONG-♥♥♥ Cavlary Unit, Heavy Armoured with a fast speed. But also having certain strengths and weaknesses and the Celts having Woad Radiers a strong brute type unit being swift and having high attack. Like the factions the units in the game have strengths and weaknesses. Enough about the units and Factions lets now talk about the music. The Music is catchy, you won't get bored of the music. The music is very fitting and is great to listen to.  What Makes AOE as a series is the Map Maker. There is a wide variety in making a may, from adding lots of different types of terrian to buildings and units. You can make your own campaign if you really wanted. The REAL Campaign Personally was alright, I enjoyed it but not enough to say it was AMAZING like the game itself. One of the things that really I enjoy about this game is the expression of custom battles and Skirmishes. You can have Skirmishes with Friends or Solo and the map will always be randomly generated. You can choose many different map types to choose from but also the premade maps from the Steam Workshop.  The Steam Workshop really increases the games overall score. The original AOE2 is outstanding but the Steam Workshop allows you to add maps, new units, OUTSTANDING new Textues and custom music as well, but also many other things.   Now Moving on to DLC 'The Forgotten' the only ever DLC released for this game enchaces the game to a point. It adds new units, factions, campaign missions and other things. Personally I love AOE2, but the DLC is not worth the money. So I do not recommend buying this DLC.  Overall this game is truly amazing, I recommend buying it but not its DLC. You will never get bored of this game as a game is always different even if you play the same faction and use the same plan. I really want a AOE4, AOE 3 is amazing but thats a another review for another day.  This game scores a 87/100 from Captain Fidgett - 'A Truly Fantastic Game with its great gameplay, map maker and a game you can't get bored at'"

"All the strategic greatness of Age of Empires 2 and its expansion, The Conquerors in one package... AoE2 HD Edition is great for people who never played the original release and want something that will work on modern systems without any problems. It's also great for people like me who absolutely loved AoE2 to begin with and was hoping for the ability to play it on modern operating systems without running into graphics or sound glitches or having to go through the workarounds for multiplayer after the MSN Gaming Zone was shut down.  That said, for an HD Edition, there's decidedly little that's actually 'HD' about it apart from being able to run in modern resolutions (just bear in mind that fullscreen runs at your desktop's resolution and there's no way to change the resolution ingame). I feel like this is mitigated by the fact that it's still a compilation of Age of Empires 2 + The Conquerors expansion, with their gameplay pretty much unaltered from the original releases and patches apart from integrating Steam achievements and using Steam for the multiplayer setup. AoE2 wouldn't really benefit all that much from significant visual upgrades anyway. After all... it's the fantastic gameplay that's kept people like me playing it pretty regularly for going on 15 years. And that's precisely what you get with this package."
Great game
Whats up guys nightpr0wler here great game 10/10   'sh hoh'
"Crappy game and I'll explain why. The reason we all baught this game isn't because of the new graphics or some stupid resolution tinkering, we did it for multiplayer and, believe it or not, this game is far from good when it comes to multiplayer. You'd play with a 30ms ping but it still feels as if you have a 1 second delay which is stupid, lets not forget about the lags and the crashes in multiplayer, the point is that it's completely unplayable in multiplayer, you'd crash, unsync, lag or simply get annoyed by the huge delays.  There's a lot of problems and it's been 2 years and nothing has changed. Everyone on the internet is talking about this but they do not respond, they keep adding DLCs for more money when the main game itself requries a lot of work."
Playing this game so long that it comes ez to me  P.S Never 1v1 a noob on arabia Its always a smurf   P.S.S Black Forest #1  Britons / Aztecs
"Age Of Empires,An Old yet Classic Game.I used to love playing this at home,fighting AI while eating slowly a delicious chocolate chip cookie.This Game is one of the best games i've played,it's still the old enjoyable game i used to play.Of course,there are mods now and the game has less bugs then the first time i played it.The gameplay is amazing and the soundtrack is nice.The design is simple yet satisfying.The whole system works together perfectly,this game just needs a bit of time and some skill to master.I've never seen someone with the same strategy and plan on playing this.Everyone plays differently which is always good experience.The multiplayer isn't dead in this game and i've played with some amazing people.  There are annoying people as well,but there isn't so much.  Beautiful Designs are easily spotted in this game as well.Various locations need different strategies which is cool as that might need some time to even think about how to make it,The Team who made this obviously spent years making this to make a game so memorable.  Pros: Awesome Gameplay Cool Soundtrack Great Designs Various Unique Locations Very Little Bugs Lots Of People Play It   Cons: None    Result:10/10 Conclusion:They deserve this score,they worked so hard on this and this has become a great masterpiece.One of the best games I've played.It is a wonderful game and It's definitely worth the price.   Want me to review a game you like?Add me if you like and tell me what game you want me to review. See you in the Next Review!"
"A classic, just as addicting today as it was back in the day."
Takes me back to my early gaming days. Still super fun and definitely worth 5 bucks.
"Oh my, it has been years since I have played this classic, and only through a gift have I finally gotten this classic added to my steam library.   As long as my review for this game could be, I will make it as simple as possible:  I love this game. There is so much replay value in it. It is simple to learn. It is fun to play with friends. It brings back nostalgia from playing this when I was younger. I have nothing but love to give to this game. If you don't have it, it is a game worth getting."
Wanna play? Too bad. Out of sync..
Great game
it crashes whenever i try to start the single player story mode #pissedoff
"I purchased this game, installed in windows 10, click play button and nothing running or open? Please help!!! thank you for your concern"
"The combat in this game is so frustrating. Trying to get units to attack correctly makes me want to rip my hair out. For whatever reason, they do not feel as responsive as they should be. Even turning the game speed all the way up the units still feel incredibly slow and clumsy. I'd take Warcraft 2 over this. I love the building and resource harvesting aspects of the game though."

Good game but multiplayer was too laggy. -.-
It's a classic realtime stratagy game that (im happy to see) is still going strong.
"Brilliant game! I used to play this on disc, back in the day, but now have it on steam, and can play online with my friends!"
Epic game ! Best idea to make remake in HD.
"i played this game as a child, and its still great (probably due to nostalgia) but there is nothing 'HD' about this re-sale.. absolutely everything looked the same except for new water layer,  its definitely worth the 3.99 Euro that its on sale for now, though :P at full price (19.99 Euro)?? not so much..."
"My current rig is 10,000 times the machine my original AoE II runner was, those many years ago.   Still can't play more than 4 armies with 200 pop cap each without experiencing unplayable lag in later stages of contest.  I will always love this game and still enjoy playing smaller battles, but what I thought I was getting, what I really wanted, was to finally be able to do 8 man high cap extravaganzas. Can't seem to get that to work.   Will still recommend this game because, wololo."
"Oldskool gaming brought back to life! My favourite game when I was a child, the graphics are virtually the same... the gameplay hasn't changed. One of the best games ever!"
This game and its predecessor brought me into this genre. God knows how much time I spent on this when i was younger.
20/20
I've been playing this game since its original release and decided to give this version a try. All I can say is I'm glad I payed so little for it. The original played smoothly and well on a 233mhz machine with 64 meg of ram and no accelerated graphics.This version is choppy and slow on a 64bit system running at 3.8ghz with 10 gigs of ram and 2gigs of gpu memory-HD it is not.Funny that a company can take what was a very fine game 16 years ago and be unable to make it work smoothly on 21st century machines. Not impressed with this release and yes I am old enough to expect things to work as advertised 'out of the box'.
I couldn't even finish the tutorial because the game constantly crashed in the last tutorial mission. This 'remaster' somehow made the game worse.
"After all the hype, was expecting the HD version to have SOME level of updated graphics. theres is NOTHING HD about this game. It still looks to be designed for 800 x 600 resoultion, and everything larger than that is pixilated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Perhaps if I played them side by side, I could see a difference, but as it is I feel like they simply slapped HD in a couple images and repacked it."
Age of Empires II might just be the best RTS game ever made. I highly recommend it!
"This game is a must buy for those who love RTS games.  After many years of playing different RTS titles, I have to say that this game is the best. If you are interested in RTS and Medieval themed games, I would highly recommend that you purchase this game now. The in game art style may be outdated, but the gameplay will never die or grow old. AoE: II has a wide variety of civilizations and historical campaigns to choose from. The maps you play in MP or with bots can be premade or randomly generated, creating infinite possibilites for gameplay. Even better, the game comes with a scenario creator that has hundreds of options letting you create the battlefield you want.   Sadly, the remastered version uses the same MP from the retail copy I have from 2001; therefore, you will often have laggy matches or disconnect. However, you can play with bots offline alone. You can also play against bots on lan or internet with friends if you wish. Luckily, the remastered version makes up for it's lack of MP by having Steam workshop and modding support, which allows for endless content that's free.   In conclusion, after many years of playing this great RTS title (I have many more hours on the disc version), I would say that it's a must have if you like classic Medieval themed RTS games. If you aren't convinced yet, you should know I have 5 copies of this game. (Original discs and others are for friends on different steam accounts.) Yes, it was worth every penny.   Overall, 10/10 would wolololo again."

"Tested on 3 different machines personally, and the friends I've played with all suffer sluggishness in this remake in both single and multiplayer, yet doesn't happen with the original CD version. The framerate starts for us below average, then drops off to such a low standard that none of us want to keep playing. As modernizing old games goes, this is a sour disappointment even after the updates from the best part of a year."
Age of Empires II might just be the best RTS game ever made. I highly recommend it!
Still waiting for the steam workshop mod for this game that changes all the trees into giant marijuana plants.
"Were you alive in the year 1999? I was, I had just gotten my first pc (technically the family's first) and I got this game for Christmas. And for the next 4 years this was pretty much all I played. And then I went to High School and I discovered cs and tfc, and then in college came the Call of Duty games, but then it all comes full circle and now I'm here playing the greatest game of all time. Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and this game is amazing if you like tactical rts'. With advanced hotkey and formation support. Battle outcomes and oppurtunities are endless. With the MSN Zone gone, Steam integration brings this game back to life. So relive your childhood/teenagehood/early20s again and drop whatever cash you need to get back into this!"
still the best RTS game in the world
"Bought because of the epic multiplayer and ye old LAN memories. Found out that the multiplayer performance is crappy and games mostly unplayable thanks to that one guy with 2000 ping who refuses to leave for the sake of others. And then someone disconnects in a 4v4 that is the only lobby with players and your rank goes down like my expectations for this game.  Or just trying to play with the guy next to you just to find out you still have a ping difference of a couple hundred ms. Looked for a solution, I really did, but nothing helped significantly.  This one too goes to the list of games I'll probably forget about until the next LAN-party, just to be disappointed again and ending up torrenting the original. Because it just works.  The single player is a great experience in itself, but I already played through that back when I was a child so I didn't replay quite everything. But the point of this review is that I bought this game to be able to play with my friends using a re-made, supposedly better working and LEGAL version of the game, but it's not possible so ♥♥♥♥ you. Until we meet again."
"While being called 'HD' and being a faithful remake of Age of Empires 2. It really just seems more like Age of Empires 2 with a tiny bit of extra code to integrate with Steam. I would have liked to have seen the textures etc to be vastly improved over what it is.   If you think you'd still play Age of Empires 2, get it, but otherwise I wouldn't bother as it is not an improvement."
"While I'm a big fan of the classics, this specific iteration of Age of Empires II: Age of Kings is nothing but a way to milk that last drop of money out of a game. Age of Kings was a great game, but you don't just add an extra straw in your drink and sell it at four times the price as a bartender, do you? Well, if the bar was owned by Hidden Path Entertainment, then I guess they would. I don't care that one of its members created the game to begin with, it's foul play, and I regret having supported the HD 'remake' of this game. The resolution additions and small fixes aren't worth those extra money."
"Alright, so AoE2, how can you go wrong? The gameplay is good, the nations are mostly balanced (I'm looking at you Persia) and the multiplayer is a blast that anyone can pick up on. The problem with this game is the graphics, there's nothing wrong with them, they just aren't worth creating an HD rerelease and selling it for XX to many dollars. I still love this game and I think its definately worth getting and playing with friends, just don't buy it full price if possible. Get it if its cheap or if the nostalgia is to much to resist, but buying full price just to see how it is isn't worth it."

"I can't even play this game anymore, I always get 'error 41'.   It's a shame because this is definitely one of my top 5 favorite games ever.  "
"This is a bad remake, its pretty much the same game it was in the 90s. especially disapointing in terms of multiplayer lag. fortunately aoe2 is maybe the best computer game of all time, since its still incredibly fun to play.  but I've changed my mind since they still have resolved nothing, I would not recommend this game. Playing on voobly is what I recommend now."
"They add new expansion ok. But we are force to play with them in the multiplayer...   No local area network support. The idle villager key doesnt work anymore. (They fixed it) Most of the online games lags and sometimes crash. 'HD', I dont see any difference, its the same game.  If you are looking for online gameplay good luck to find fair games.  The elo rating system is pretty primitive."
"The video game equivalent of every mom on planet Earth constantly telling a development team to clean their room. 3 years later, they're still shoving ♥♥♥♥ under the bed.  Oh, I see you've got a new expansion out. No more allowance until you clean up this mess, young man!"
"Good game, it is very fun."
I love this game &lt;3
"Futile attempts of this game's correction go from bad to worse. Random crashes/out of syncs are still fairly common. Number of hours I spent with this game proves how much I enjoy playing with my friends in spite of those nuisances, but I'm assessing game here, not community."
"It's a great game and a decent port to newer systems with new content. However, they managed to implement gamebreaking bugs into multiplayer with the Afrikan Empires expansion (game always desynchs after a few seconds) and haven't released so much as hotfix for over half a year.  I would have fully recommended the game to anyone before, but the fact is you will get a fundamentally broken product and the chances of them ever fixing it don't look too well considering they did nothing about it for such a long time.  Do NOT buy."
I can't find the wololo meme
"'The Classic Strategy' Didn't play it for a lot of time and I was really happy to hear that it gonna be popular again!  Really good game, intresting and not easy single, various of options at the multi. Not like at AOE3 at AOE2 you have to think about strategy - at AOE3 you just have to win in 20 minutes.   BUT The game doesn't worth 20 bucks, you should buy it when it on a sale of at least 40-50%."
Great Game!
"The ultimate balanced classical RTS. Great game, I like the new HD version."
"Perfect game for those seeking nastalgia points. I bought this to relive my boy-teen life through my older eyes. I missed the simplicity of an RTS after playing so many games which includes terrible communities. AoE has been a favorite in my gaming library as a disk, and now as a digital game that I cannot lose this time. 11 out of 6 thumbs up!"
Wololo
"   Everybody get up, it's time to slam now We got a real jam goin' down Welcome to the Space Jam Here's your chance, do your dance at the Space Jam, alright   "
classic game with new lobby system
This game brings back the memories of playing against my brother and dad all day long like a tournament! Love this game and glad it is HD now!
"I've played every installment in the AoE series, including Mythology. In my opinion, this game is the best in terms of gameplay. The fact that this is an HD re-release makes it even better. Play this game if you want an excellent RTS experience."
It's Age of Empires II. Duh guys.
Even better then the original!
"Was probably the at the Top of the RTS games in its time, now its back! Revamp!, Now HD more CIVS, New workshop for better customed games. ingame lobby and stream. so check it out and enjoy"
"This game is almost as old as I am. And just like me, it hasn't aged a bit. Still got it after all these years!"
"Reliving ones favorite childhood game is always great. Reccomend for all fans of the original AoE2 who want to play multiplayer easily mod, or play the brand new expansion pack"
Great game.
"If you liked this when you had this game before this version, get it for a little texture increase, steam online play(handy if you had problems to play within network in previous version) and steam workshop"
"It was a fantastic game back in its day, and it is a fantastic game still today."
"Awesome game! Well worth the money. Games last ~2-3 hours each, but they are very fun."
"AOE2 - Brilliant game, now with steam support for playing online! Perfect, Many hours of fun, definitely worth the money!"
Great game I used to love playing!!!
Best game ever you can play it for hours and hours and you never get tired
Absolutely AMAZING. So much childhood and the HD/Forgotten additions are great!
Great Game. THe campeigns of old have been revamped with much harder AI even on standard. Prepare for some serious frustration if you play without cheats!
Just 6 words: How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!
"15 years later, this is still one of the greatest games ever."
"Destroyed a Mining hut, Enemy gave up 10/10"
"This game I reccomend to anyone who has played the orginal age of empires, it's a great game and the HD remake just polishes the series off nicely."
Really love this game! If you get it send me a friends request and we can play!
"perfect remastered, save my nostalgia (y) 10/10"
Age of Empires II! BEST!
"What can I say?  This is one of the all-time classic RTS's. And before you think 'classic' means old looking/dated etc.etc, don't you believe it! This is the HD version which (if you have a HD monitor like myself 1920/1080) then this runs and fits perfectly on your monitor. Not one of those old games that stretches across your screen ruining your enjoyment.  I bought this for my Mrs some time ago and she has so far played over 400 hours on it! Pure addiction. I myself have spent only a mere 130+ hrs.  As of writing this review, I have noted that Steam have both game and the forgotten expansion pack on sale for only £2.84. That's just downright ridiculous price... GET IT!! I paid more than that and it was well worth it!  I'm not going into any more detail about the game itself as there are already some great reviews on here. But believe me, if you love real time strategy games, you MUST have this in your collection. It would be an insult if you don't!  Can't recommend this game highly enough.  BUY IT NOW!! "
"I started playing this game when I was the age of 12 when I first learned about the free demo version provided by Microsoft Studios. I loved this game so much that I saved up lunch money and bought this game. Unfortunately, I lost the CD when I was moving and haven't played it until I heard that they were remaking the  game as a HD version. Nothing has changed that altered my view on this game and I love it.  One of the appealing parts of this game is that the scenarios are really playable, specific, and historically accurate. Unlike other 'history' oriented-games, this actually provides an accurate view of the historic battles. One such example is the Battle of Noryang, where the Koreans had to protect themselves from the Japanese invaders even when they were overwhelmed (around 140 vs 500). Also, this is the battle where Admiral Yi-Shun-Shin died in battle on his famous Turtle Ship. Like the historic facts provided, in the game you are able to commandeer the famous Turtle Ships and defeat the invaders.   For those who haven't entered the world of RTS, this is your chance. Your chance to experience one of the most ORIGNIAL RTS game on the market and in my opinion, the best game there is.  "
"You will lose so many hours with this game.  The classic Age of Empires didn't even need to be made into HD, the quality of the gameplay alone has made this game into a success. It's complex, brutally unforgiving and the new AI means that the only frustration you will feel is that of your own skill."
This game is awesome
"It is back from the dead! Age of Empires II HD edition is the game that we all know and love from our days of youth. With the ability to customize the game through Steam Workshop, the incredibly simple way to connect to another game and not to mention the slight increase of graphics to high definition, this game is worth every penny. If you are a fan of the Age of Empires series, or even a real-time strategy enthusiast, this game is a must have. So stop reading this and go purchase a copy so that you might reign supreme over your friends and enemies. Wololo!"
"AoE II was the first computer game I ever played, and shaped my interests in gaming in general to be almost entirely strategy and RTS games. AoE II is an amazing game and I have personally logged well over 1000 hours of play, before it became available on Steam. I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody, especially people who generally like RTSs."
Too expensive for a remake of a 15 year old game. Great game nonetheless
awesome game buy it when you can
classics! classics in HD! classics in HD with online multiplayer!  What you want more?! Buy it now!!!  10/10
Amazing game. cant stop playing!
Great game i love it. Really brings back memories. AI is ALOT harder then the orginal game which in my opinion is a good thing since theirs more of a challenge now. not much big changes from the orginal game but you do notice alot of little differents that makes the game amazing. The use of multiplayer is great aswell if the AI get to easy for you give yourself a try agaisnt some other humans! that will really test your skills.  If your wondering if this game is worth it i say yes.
Where did my last 10 Hours go?
"As good if not better than the original.   The updated graphics make this game amazing to play even now. Get a group of friends together and prepare for a night of building armies, making and breaking friendships, and waging war on everyone. While there are clear sweaty tactics and overpowered nations (I'm looking at you Chinese!) most of these can be countered by tactical decisions and swift acting.  If you are a fan of the original or looking to enjoy a great strategy game this is a must buy. And with the Steam Workshop and scenario builder you can find more great game modes or maps to play with friends or solo.  Overall 9/10"
Awesome game had the original game (non-HD) and spent 100's of hrs on it this just made me so happy when it came out. highly recommended for anyone that loves strategy or history or just loves video games in general.
one of the best RTS games
Played this game when I was literally 8 years old and loved it. Played it again 10 years later and still love it. They really need to make more games like this!
"AMAZING! SO MUCH FUN.   Age of Empires 2 was the first game I ever played as a child. This new 'HD' edition is awesome as it is the same game, but runs on modern computers and looks very very nice.   I also highly reccomend getting the forgotten expansions addition, it adds a lot of cool content such as new civilizations, map sizes, game modes and tons more!"
gg microsoft
"Age of Empires II is a good example of an excellent genre of game. As an RTS it is easy to pick up and play but contains lots of hidden depth and takes time and experience to master fully. Compared to other big RTS games AOE II has a very large range of different races to play as but the races themselves do not differ greatly from each other stats wise or visually. Compared to Blizzard's RTS games it does not stand up when it comes to attention to detail or race/character individuality but it does have plenty of replay value and lengthy campaigns.  The online play in this game is great, playing with friends is a great way to enjoy this game and improve your skills as you do so. Creating a game can be simple or complex depending on your preferences and its easy to invite your friends in to join you."
"A fantastic game for all those A0E fans. I love the steam workshop, it really adds to the game with whole new campaigns, heros, graphics, and additional units. The community is also fantastic, instantly helping with any problems. If you've never played an Age of Empire game, definitely get this and you will love it!"
Great Game 10/10
"Great game for strategy and building people, i recomend getting the forgotten dlc aswell"
"It's Age of Empires 2 and it's in HD. There are some ugly technical issues, like not being able to change the resolution at which the game runs, but otherwise it's working fine. Same old game at higher resolutions with some improved graphical effects."
Old and very good game
One of the best RTS ever created - in HD. Yes please.
"1. Build some houses around towers (nearby gold piles).  2. Put some archers in the towers.  3. Control other gold resources on the map.  4. GG new AI, good try"
"old but good,decent game overall "
Since i was little i wanted this game and thank god for steam sales xD
I loved this game when it first came out in non HD years ago. I was even happier when it was released in HD and all my friends were playing.  Multiplayer with friends is awesome. 10/10
"The Legend , now in HD :)"
Oh the nostalgia!
"A smooth, stunning remake of possibly the best RTS to happen to you computer. Includes the Conqueror's Expansion and don't forget to grab the new Forgotten campaign pack! Be sure to pick up Age of Mythology as well. :3"
Excellent version of this game. Nice to see a lobby with a small fan base up again.
Single greatest real time strategy game of all time.
"Spent far too much of my life playing the original when I was younger. Now I can spend even more time playing one of the best games ever made, in HD!!!  The HD update helps to help the age of the game, but the gameplay is timeless and is still just as good as I remember."
"Nothing to say guys Best Strategy game ever, just buy it"
Love the game! But can't see any graphical changes exept the water...but anyways the game is awesome and it brings back memories!! :)

"Just like the original one, but with better multiplayer support! (right click to join etc.) Also, It's always nice to have a new expansion."
So much easier to play multi now that it is on Steam!
"Classic game, now in HD... I do recommend this HD remake but only if its on sale... Does have some frame rate issues but for the most part its worth it :)"
This game is awesome
Such a great game. Reuniting me with my childhood
"Awesome game, bring back the old Age Of Empires feeling. Love it to the bone."
Amazing game. I have loved AoE since the begining and this one deffinatly lives up to expectations. The game its self is pretty much the exact same as before now with much better graphics.
"Well, a couple of days ago I bought Age of Empires II on Steam, because I have so many fond memories of playing it as a kid. The thing that got me worried though was that I wasn't sure whether I would still enjoy it now...   I couldn't have been more wrong!   Man I used to play this game on my crappy old laptop, it was so much fun! I remember making whole maps with oceans and forests, then starting from the dark ages with a few villagers to make it to the imperial age whilst fighting off armies of intruders from the inky blackness of the unexplored regions. It really is a fun game to play and here are some of the reasons why:  1) There are so many customisation possibilities, you can make almost any scenario imaginable (well, as long as they are historical ones). There is a fully customisable map editor, where you can build anything from natural landscapes to villages and cities. In this editor you can also change the game type (conquest, king of the hill etc.) and the enemies you face (including their civilisation, eg. the vikings). There are up to seven AI controlled players to either battle with, or even form alliances and trade.  2) The mixture of building an thriving economy, amassing a formidable army and furthering your civilisation with loads of technologies to research (which differ between civilisations), makes gameplay rewarding and addictive. There is nothing better than watching your civilisation grow and prosper from a tiny group of villagers with a town centre into an amazing city, producing forces to bring your enemies to their knees!  3) There is a great campaign mode that is both fun and challenging. The campaigns are split up into different historical events (for example, the tutorial features the Scottish battles against Edward Longshanks' English forces) and feature figures such as Joan of Arc and Atilla the Hun. It's surprising how much detail has gone into these campaigns when it so easy to make your own games; there are fully voiced introductions to each of the missions, and numerous objectives and optional missions to complete each time.  4) With the introduction of the title onto Steam, there has been a complete revamp of the online features. There is a whole community of players with which to battle and ally yourself with (admittedly I haven't tried the online features yet, but they do look promising). Steam has also introduced achievements and trading cards to the game, which can only make things better right? However one of the best things about moving onto steam though is the fact that there are so many mods available! (right now I have a mod that includes Arnold Schwarzeneggar taunts to my sound list)   My one gripe with the game is something that I believe has been many peoples' concerns since the game was first released back in 1999; the AI can be pretty awkward sometimes. This usually comes through when your army runs off without you noticing to pursue a single enemy scout, only to be slaughtered when they reach the enemy stronghold. Or you build an amazing empire to realise that the enemy hasn't built a single thing... they have just chopped down every tree on the map (why this happened I have no idea).   The one thing I will say about this is that the AI on the new steam version is updated (and so are the graphics, huzzah!) and doesn't seem as silly as before, and there are updates still coming. All in all though, I think that this game is completely worth your time and money, and will keep you entertained for hours, so grab a copy or download it from steam, you won't regret it!  The Fox Eyed Man's Rating: 8.5/10"
"I have put countless hours into this game since it was originally released and it's nice to see AoE2 being revived with new DLC and a fairly active community after all these years. This game is well worth the money especially if you grew up playing, the convenience of the HD edition means you don't have to worry about finding patches and if the game will crash or not, (if installed from the original disks the game would crash with newer graphics cards and widescreen resolutions because, put simply, when the game was created, it wasn't created for widescreen resolutions)."
Age of Empires 2 has always been one of my favourite games and this HD Collection allows me to revisit the glory days of spending hours building grand armies and civilizations with or against my friends.
"What can I say? This game is literally the game that made me a history geek as early as age 8 when the game came out a year later.   What other 2nd graders did you know that knew about William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Ghengis Khan, Saladin, and Barbarossa? That was how obsessed I was with this game.   Timeless classic strategy game that shall never be forgotten!!!  11/10"
BACK TO BASICS :)
It was the my first game. And im still love this ♥♥♥♥in game. I was saw steam sale and bought this game thx valve :')
"The first game I fell in love with, and it will stay with me untill the end."
"Been playing this game since I was eight years old. Eight years later, I still play it. Buy it, it is probably the best real time strategy game of all time. 11/10"
"As it first came out a fantastic game, but now with HD and a population count of 500 :D"
YES! I recommend this game to anyone who wants to have some fun with some good old RTS!
"Even better than i remember it, this is prabably due to them still releasing patches 15 YEARS after releasing it."
this game is incredible one of very few that is still very fun even if it is so old.  been playing since i was a little kid love this game  10/10
A classic. Grew up playing this.

Still one of the best games I have ever played. 
"Brings back good old memories to STEAM. What more is there to it? I love it, definitely pick it up - even during sales!"
Perfect at LAN parties.
"One of my favorite childhood games... updated to run on a version of windows made in the last 20 years :D Not much in terms of changes, but I'm a-ok with that."
Good game and a great investment for your free time
LOVE IT 
"Awesome game. Just like the old days, but better."
This is the classic game we all know and love with a few new bonus added extras. Great for LAN partys and something I enjoy spending many hours defeating my enemies.
the best game in the world
"Worthy of any RTS awards! Great classic strategic combat with a HD improvement, nicely balanced building and resource management. It may be an older game now, but its just as good as any of the modern 5 star RTS. Excellent multiplayer and tierd campaigns to play.  Just as good if not better then age of empires 3, and still has an active community.  This is one of those games that will stay with you like a jeweld golden tooth, and you tell the developers put their blood swet and tears into this game to make it what it has become."
"Great Games, can lag a bit at 500 population but overall great remake of the good old Age II game."
Haven't played this in years! So happy they have updated it :)
buy and play this. best game ever.
"This game is a good remake of the old Age of Empires II and it is a lot of fun. The fact that it is on Steam makes playing with friends very easy. It is a bit laggier than the old version though, so I don't recommend it for people that have an older computer."
Greatest game ever.
"Classic, maybe obsoleted, but where else can you send waves after waves of poor pikemen to storm the wall they absoluately are not capable of taking down?  9/10  "
"A classic that has aged as well as one might hope. For the strategic minded, and anybody that thrives on macro, micro, and multi tasking. Easily makes it into my top 3 favorite games of all time."
i'm diggin' this music tho
"Buy it, its a great game."
Age of Empires II HD is a amazing rework of the first game. It added balance and it also added more modern graphics whilst still keeping the origonal feel to the game.
Old but Gold
I like this game and eating hamburgers
"Age of Empires 2 HD brings the player the classic strategy game as you have never seen before. Upgraded graphics, sounds and music along with Steam Workshop integration allow the player to create and distribute mods freely whilst at the same time preserving the original along with the multiplayer experience."
Nothing like competing for resources while overthrowing an enemy. Great with friends or with the computer player. The years have not knocked the dust off this classic. 10 out of 10.
One of my all time favourite classics now in HD! Great to play with friends and foes alike
OVERALL TOP NOTCH GAME  PROS- STANDS THE TEST OF TIME YADA YADA CONS - NO SEGWAYS    BUY DIS GAME
Brilliant strategy game that I've been playing for nearly a decade now. DLC is great and all the updates and bug-fixes have been well-received. The Forgotten expansion pack is well worth a look for those of you who have become overly-familiar with the standard AoE II content.
"Look at these HD Icons,  Oh dear god help my eyes are already bleeding What was it like without HD? jesus.  Other than that this game is really fun and i like to use my amazing skill to kill EVERY-no one. cause i'm terrible at this game.  Other than that. buy the game it's amazing."
"This game is fun, especially when playing with a friend... also cant wait for age of mythology"
"Awesome instalment of Strategy, my childhood was spent in AOE and AOE2 is just as awesome!"
"A faithful remake of the original, AoE II HD is a must-play for anyone who has any interest whatsoever in RTS games. The AI has been beefed up so that, instead of just getting 3x/5x the resources you do from each gathering instance at higher difficutlies, they also can micro their monks, build counters, and intelligently design their bases for the most part. A++"
A classic that been resurrected! One of my all-time favourite strategy games - the pioneering game that got me hooked into the genre. Never gets dull. Recommend it if you've been a fan and are looking for some nostalgia :)
REally enjoyed going back in time to play this. Certainly worth a pick up if at a decent discount
this game is one of the funiest strategy i ever played
"What can I say- Roggan? Wololo? Shall I blame my ISP? Ahh memories.   I first played Age of Empires 2 when my brother showed me the demo for the conqueror's expansion pack, and since then I've been hooked by this game for God knows how long, I guess since I was in second grade- like 2002. Anyways, he didn't get Age of Kings until I got a chance to play Age of Empires 1, and damn, even though it wasn't the second I still loved it.   When Age of Empires 2 HD Edition first came to steam I was like 'HELL YES! I'm getting this.' However, I was a little disapointed, because of the lack of HD but it was still worth getting; thus, my childhood memories came back to me, and with the Forgotten Empires now an official AO2 expansion pack( would have been nice if they added cutscenes) I now have the chance to relive childhood memories with the sense that this is a completly different experience from what I encountered back in the winter of 2002.   I can also thank A02 for getting me into PC Gaming; back then, I was a console peasent, and I know that there was great games for consoles back than like Goldeneye 64( which gets an excetion for being an awesome game), but still Consoles lacked the manpower which was built in PC's. And AO2, I can thank this game for converting me from the Yellow Consoles to the Blue PC's."
"The best strategy game, ever!!"
game still has sweg many years on!
"Everyone should know what this game has to offer and therefore it does'nt need a review, for the one person who does not know what this game is. Buy it and play it, even if it is outdated it is a important milestone in gaming history and everyone should have played it at least once!"
"Awesome game! Well worth the money. Games last ~2-3 hours each, but they are very fun."
Excellent game - definately worth the price.
"Be aware, Mongols will come and kill your fishing ships. [based on a true story]"
Awesome!!! Brings back the good old days
Great Game. THe campeigns of old have been revamped with much harder AI even on standard. Prepare for some serious frustration if you play without cheats!
"Long awaited update for the classic Age of Empires II in 2003. Don't forget to get 'The Forgotten' expansion to have access to the new races: Incas, Indians, Italians etc."
"amazing game, you can waste your extra time playing it"
game still has sweg many years on!
"Awesome game! Well worth the money. Games last ~2-3 hours each, but they are very fun."
I can't find the wololo meme
I expected more civilizations in the release of age2 hd but the 'Forgotten expansion' solves the problem.  Making campaigns is difficult but worth it when you can show it to your friends.  I also think that it was a bad idea to not allow total conversion mods on the steam workshop.  It still has the charm of age of empires and the great campaigns.  Skirmishing and multiplayer remains challenging and fun.  Overall age2 hd is one of my favourite games I hope you like it and enjoy playing it.
"It's basically the same game you used to play when you were a child. Don't expect superb graphic: the textures are essentially the same. The only different thing you'll find is the resolution.  Other than that, there's a server browsing system with an active online community, and the possibility to change some settings thanks to the workshop's mods."
"Everytime I click on something, a villager says 'Toaster Strudel'. Who did this?  10/10"
It's the same game it always was and just as good as you remember.  Nostalgia without the heartbreaking letdown.
"This game is a blast from the past, now in HD! I grew up playing this game and it brought back a lot of memories to play it again. It it the kind of game that I can really get into even though I have played it a thousand times."
"   Everybody get up, it's time to slam now We got a real jam goin' down Welcome to the Space Jam Here's your chance, do your dance at the Space Jam, alright   "
classic game with new lobby system
"Perfect game for those seeking nastalgia points. I bought this to relive my boy-teen life through my older eyes. I missed the simplicity of an RTS after playing so many games which includes terrible communities. AoE has been a favorite in my gaming library as a disk, and now as a digital game that I cannot lose this time. 11 out of 6 thumbs up!"
Wololo
"The ultimate balanced classical RTS. Great game, I like the new HD version."
Great game I used to love playing!!!
"AOE2 - Brilliant game, now with steam support for playing online! Perfect, Many hours of fun, definitely worth the money!"
"'The Classic Strategy' Didn't play it for a lot of time and I was really happy to hear that it gonna be popular again!  Really good game, intresting and not easy single, various of options at the multi. Not like at AOE3 at AOE2 you have to think about strategy - at AOE3 you just have to win in 20 minutes.   BUT The game doesn't worth 20 bucks, you should buy it when it on a sale of at least 40-50%."
Great Game!
"I have put countless hours into this game since it was originally released and it's nice to see AoE2 being revived with new DLC and a fairly active community after all these years. This game is well worth the money especially if you grew up playing, the convenience of the HD edition means you don't have to worry about finding patches and if the game will crash or not, (if installed from the original disks the game would crash with newer graphics cards and widescreen resolutions because, put simply, when the game was created, it wasn't created for widescreen resolutions)."
"Nothing to say guys Best Strategy game ever, just buy it"
Forever a favourite since childhood. Took me around 70 hours just to finish (no cheats) both the age of kings and conquerors campaigns. Looking forward to the many more single and multi-player battles to come.  Even Grant from Mythbusters used to play this game:   http://youtu.be/goJWv15GqRw?t=1m 
"Well, a couple of days ago I bought Age of Empires II on Steam, because I have so many fond memories of playing it as a kid. The thing that got me worried though was that I wasn't sure whether I would still enjoy it now...   I couldn't have been more wrong!   Man I used to play this game on my crappy old laptop, it was so much fun! I remember making whole maps with oceans and forests, then starting from the dark ages with a few villagers to make it to the imperial age whilst fighting off armies of intruders from the inky blackness of the unexplored regions. It really is a fun game to play and here are some of the reasons why:  1) There are so many customisation possibilities, you can make almost any scenario imaginable (well, as long as they are historical ones). There is a fully customisable map editor, where you can build anything from natural landscapes to villages and cities. In this editor you can also change the game type (conquest, king of the hill etc.) and the enemies you face (including their civilisation, eg. the vikings). There are up to seven AI controlled players to either battle with, or even form alliances and trade.  2) The mixture of building an thriving economy, amassing a formidable army and furthering your civilisation with loads of technologies to research (which differ between civilisations), makes gameplay rewarding and addictive. There is nothing better than watching your civilisation grow and prosper from a tiny group of villagers with a town centre into an amazing city, producing forces to bring your enemies to their knees!  3) There is a great campaign mode that is both fun and challenging. The campaigns are split up into different historical events (for example, the tutorial features the Scottish battles against Edward Longshanks' English forces) and feature figures such as Joan of Arc and Atilla the Hun. It's surprising how much detail has gone into these campaigns when it so easy to make your own games; there are fully voiced introductions to each of the missions, and numerous objectives and optional missions to complete each time.  4) With the introduction of the title onto Steam, there has been a complete revamp of the online features. There is a whole community of players with which to battle and ally yourself with (admittedly I haven't tried the online features yet, but they do look promising). Steam has also introduced achievements and trading cards to the game, which can only make things better right? However one of the best things about moving onto steam though is the fact that there are so many mods available! (right now I have a mod that includes Arnold Schwarzeneggar taunts to my sound list)   My one gripe with the game is something that I believe has been many peoples' concerns since the game was first released back in 1999; the AI can be pretty awkward sometimes. This usually comes through when your army runs off without you noticing to pursue a single enemy scout, only to be slaughtered when they reach the enemy stronghold. Or you build an amazing empire to realise that the enemy hasn't built a single thing... they have just chopped down every tree on the map (why this happened I have no idea).   The one thing I will say about this is that the AI on the new steam version is updated (and so are the graphics, huzzah!) and doesn't seem as silly as before, and there are updates still coming. All in all though, I think that this game is completely worth your time and money, and will keep you entertained for hours, so grab a copy or download it from steam, you won't regret it!  The Fox Eyed Man's Rating: 8.5/10"
"Brings back old memories. A classic, great game."
Age Of Empires 2 HD is the best one in the series imho. A true classic.
10/10
"7/10 About what I expected, which is to say, the same graphics, same units, same maps and factions, with a couple new campaigns added on top. I still have my disks to AoE1,2 and 3, so only bought this verison when it went on sale with the additional campaigns, and I have to say it was worth it. Now, If you are looking for soemthing completely new, or an updated UI, or massively improved graphics, no, you are not going to be pleased. However, there were tweaks in many areas, one being that unit selection seems to have been boosted, there are now options much higher unit caps allowed, and the water doesn't turn a splotchy purple and the grass a red speckled blur on my monitor, as the original version does. Pathing for units has also been changed... but that's a mixed bag. Sometimes better, sometimes they hang up an entire battalion on one lone tree.  As for the new campaigns, I'd say they're as good as the old. Definitely a challenge (though that might be artific of not having played them a dozen times, as I have Ghegis Khan, Barbarrossa, Joan of Arc, and the Aztecs) with the new factions being fairly interesting.  If you go into it expecting the same game, merely updated to be playable on a modern machine, you'll definitely be getting what you want. If you are doing it for the nostalgia... wait for a sale, or you'll probably feel you overpayed. And, again, I'd definitely suggest getting the 'Forgotten' campaings, too."
"What can I say?  This is one of the all-time classic RTS's. And before you think 'classic' means old looking/dated etc.etc, don't you believe it! This is the HD version which (if you have a HD monitor like myself 1920/1080) then this runs and fits perfectly on your monitor. Not one of those old games that stretches across your screen ruining your enjoyment.  I bought this for my Mrs some time ago and she has so far played over 400 hours on it! Pure addiction. I myself have spent only a mere 130+ hrs.  As of writing this review, I have noted that Steam have both game and the forgotten expansion pack on sale for only £2.84. That's just downright ridiculous price... GET IT!! I paid more than that and it was well worth it!  I'm not going into any more detail about the game itself as there are already some great reviews on here. But believe me, if you love real time strategy games, you MUST have this in your collection. It would be an insult if you don't!  Can't recommend this game highly enough.  BUY IT NOW!! "
"I started playing this game when I was the age of 12 when I first learned about the free demo version provided by Microsoft Studios. I loved this game so much that I saved up lunch money and bought this game. Unfortunately, I lost the CD when I was moving and haven't played it until I heard that they were remaking the  game as a HD version. Nothing has changed that altered my view on this game and I love it.  One of the appealing parts of this game is that the scenarios are really playable, specific, and historically accurate. Unlike other 'history' oriented-games, this actually provides an accurate view of the historic battles. One such example is the Battle of Noryang, where the Koreans had to protect themselves from the Japanese invaders even when they were overwhelmed (around 140 vs 500). Also, this is the battle where Admiral Yi-Shun-Shin died in battle on his famous Turtle Ship. Like the historic facts provided, in the game you are able to commandeer the famous Turtle Ships and defeat the invaders.   For those who haven't entered the world of RTS, this is your chance. Your chance to experience one of the most ORIGNIAL RTS game on the market and in my opinion, the best game there is.  "
"15 years later, this is still one of the greatest games ever."
Highly recommend! Spent months of my childhood playing the original and it's still more fun to play than most modern games. It kicks Civ5's ♥♥♥!
"This was my childhood game and was extremely good. I am pleased to see that it still holds up to this day. With complex strategy and a excellent skill ceilling not to mention native languages for each civilisation, I very much recomend this game  "
"Not-so-HD, but overall, if you don't own Age of Empires II it's a must-have."
A great remake of the Original. The Graphics dont look very different but other than that it is a great game for new players and those who played the original (like me). The multiplayer can sometimes take a long time to connect and sometimes may seem a bit laggy but single player is just as fun. I would highly recommend this game. :D
"This game is super addicting and great to play with and against friends! I really like trying out the different civilizations and watching my little dudes making it happen. The game is easy to learn, but developing a winning strategy takes a while. I'm not super into gaming, but I can see myself playing this one for a good long time."
"Best Real Time Strategy Game I've EVER played! The start point for every RTS fan, Amazing soundtrack, Amazing Gameplay, Amazing everything!!!!  Such a nostalgia!! You defenitely MUST HAVE this game on your steam's library! 10/10"
JUST BUY &amp; PLAY... This is the age of Empires 2. Game of our childhood. Still need any other explanations ?? I don't care which method you gonna use to buy this game but just do it. This is one of the games that must be in your steam library!!!!!
"This is game is amazing. I can't stress how much you need to get this game, Because its awesome, it really is, just get it, right now, do it."
I am the The Conqueror. Challenge me if you dare. Amazing game!
"Still a pretty damn good strategy game even after all these years. This HD edition now allows us to play on widescreen mode, so that means no more huge black bars on each side of the screen. The graphics have been ever so slighty enhanced, but they still retain the classic original AoE 2 feel.  Steam workshop also brings a new dimension to this game as we are now able to easily download content."
"300 hours played. A classic RTS game. This game is worth every penny at full price. If you can get it on a Steam sale, pull the trigger. There is still a multiplayer following. The DLC is fun too because you have new maps and civilizations. There is even new DLC coming in the near future of a 15 year old game!"
"Amazing classic, never gets old!"
"Che?, bantéwon"
The first video game I ever played and I forever agree that it is one of the best games ever created. It set the bar for RTS games and Company of Heroes owes alot to this.  Easily a 10/10.
Just 6 words: How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!How do you turn this on!
"This game I reccomend to anyone who has played the orginal age of empires, it's a great game and the HD remake just polishes the series off nicely."
"Destroyed a Mining hut, Enemy gave up 10/10"
"It's a classic! If you have never played this game, now is the perfect time to buy it and hop right it! With all the new things that can be downloaded from the workshop, the fun never ends. This already timeless classic has been made immortal!"
I've played this game for 91 hours and i still have not completed any campaign. From the 25 i played multiplayer i've won one time thats wy i keep playing because i want to become good and i still dont know what i do wrong. Some levels on campaign are 'impossible' you start in dark age with some soldiers you enemy starts in castle age with a huge empire also the price is cheap in sale i bought this game+the DLC for €8.
It's not really Age of Empires II HD - it's more 'Age of Empires II - viewed from really really far away'  Still a cool game though.
The Industrial Standard RTS. Absolute necessity.
"AoE II is one of my favorite games of all time, which I played to no end many years ago. The release of AoE II HD was exciting, not just because it was in HD this time, but because of steam support. While I feel like the HD release could have fixed some things (like awful AI pathfinding), it came in pretty much the same state that I remember it as when I played it many years ago. This means that the textures did not recieve a 2014 HD remake, but rather the game was optimized to run on modern computers. It really doesn't look different at all. As far as bringing a classic to my modern system, AoE II HD succeeds, but it doesn't bring much else."
My favorite RTS of all time. Get it now!
Old but gold.
"DISCLAIMER: I'm not a multiplayer person, so can't comment much on that aspect  It's the same good old AOE II we loved and played nonstop few years backs. That's the biggest PRO and biggest CON at the same time though...  HD version pretty much just means that you can run it on current widescreen resolutions. The whole game is zoomed out quite a bit compared to the original. I expected them to update textures and make the game a bit prettier. None of that happened though, the only updated visuals seem to be water surfaces, which looks wavy and animated now. Units still look pixely, same for buildings.  I didn't notice any updates to controls, UI, etc. It's still the same, but hey don't change what works I guess.  Apart from the Forgotten 'expansion' there is no new added content. But tbh Forgotten seems more like an official mod than a legit expansion. Added campaigns have no voiceovers, they added some new nations, too. But no technologies or any major stuff like AoC did to original AoE2.  Would I recommend it? If you loved old AoE2 then yes, it is quite fun. Don't expect any new experience or mind blowing innovations. I'm a bit skeptical about paying 20 euros for such an old game with just a resolution update though. With that said it seems to go on sale quite often, so consider getting it then."
Briefly: IMHO the best HD remake done yet. This game is definitely NOT dead. Patches fixed and improved gameplay a lot. New AI is amazing. Multiplayer works very well. Go n buy this legend!
"I played this game back when it first came out, for me this is very nostalgic and still as fun as I remembered it. Providing you're ok with the game being extremely time consuming (up to 2 hrs a game sometimes depending on settings ect) its a great addition to the Library :)"
"Nostalgia... I loved this game and still do. I didn't mind re-buying it for 3$ - of course I owned the original + expansion. It does what it's supposed to do, makes the game easily playable at correct resolutions without the need for crazy fixes etc."
 AoE II HD FAN!
"El classico de perfectione! I grew up with Age of Empires. But unfortunatly Age of Empires got their golden years when this part of the series was released. It's still the best one. Uncreadible possibilites. You can sit down and spent hours of hours with the single player campaign or you can rush the campaign to play online, but maybe you aint playing the campaign att all. In my opinion Age of Empires 2 is the still one of the best strategy-games that exist."
"Great game that is loads of fun to play with friends. Very easy to get into, but the gap between noob and pro is pretty massive. Find friends on a similar skill level as you and have a blast! The price is pretty steep, but it goes on sale fairly often. Add it to your wishlist and give it a shot when it's marked down!"
"Its Age Of Empires 2, you think its gonna be bad?"
"As far as MMORPGs go, this game is a true masterpiece. The character design is fantastic and even features voice acting from some of Hollywood's most famous, including Jimmy Fallon, Sandra Bullock, and that asian guy from the Hangover! The brilliant voice acting is accompanied by incredible scenery, luscious open worlds, and many mini-game modes such as 'Gang Wars'. If you haven't purchased this game, then you haven't truely experienced tower defense gaming. 3 out of 7"
"Nice paintjob, but...  An inability to change resolutions or make the menus any larger, and an overly sensitive edge-scrolling mouse control scheme make the game a bit more of a chore to play than the original.  I like that there's new content. The developers wanted to update the game, not just amp up the resolution and push it out the door. If you already own Age of Empires II, you won't just be paying for a flashier version.  All things considered, the original is easier to work with, but this is still an outstanding game and worth a try."
It is almost exactly the same as the original game but that doesnt meen its bad. If you have lost your copy of AoE2 then it is a good purchase to get. AoE2 is verry fun   10/10!
"Bring me back memories from ooold times... mIRC, 56k connections, Hell Hole mods, flush (oh my, I can't believe I could go Feudal in 7 minutes), studying recorded games, etc etc..."
Fantastic update to a classic game. Increased population cap is an excellent upgrade.
Very nice game recommend 100% 
"A timeless classic, I genuinely feel like Age of Empires II is one of those games that never get boring and are still easy to pick up and play, even after 16 years since its original release.   On top of that, it has Workshop Support, so you can go wild and try out all kinds of fan-made maps and mods.  Or if you just want to chill while talking with friends on Skype/Curse, then this game fits the bill."
"A good old classic remastered, I played this game so much with my friends that I bought just for the nostalgia factor. I would be greatly surprised if I don't play it a lot more now that's it's been re-released."
Extreamly addicting RTS. In my opinion it's be best in the series. Pick a race and advance your technology. You have many options to change the game play.   Convert all the things
Excellent game to play alone or with others. Good strategy and diverse cultures to use.
A classic RTS that I have played for countless hours even before Steam exsisted. Awesome to know they are still making DLC's for is and the Steam workshop content is practically endless. Although fairly laggy in the multiplayer at times it is for sure one of my top 10 favorite RTS games of all time.
"As a long time AOE fan, I have to admit AOE2 is still one of the best strategy games out there even this game already more than a decade old.   The downsides of this game is the bugs and glitches still did not manage to fix."
"The best RTS for a long multiplayer party. AOE II. old, but can not be forgotten :)"
"One of my favourite games of all time! While some of the improvements may seem a bit off at first such as the fire, being able to play this in HD via steam is so worth it!!!"
Absolutely EPIC. First time i touched this game I was 8 years old. Number one RTS since early 2000s.
"Best game of all times, still enjoying after 10 decades, wololo."
"Where do I begin with this game! I started playing this game 4 years ago and loved it, so many fond memories of building a empire and crushing the AI. Little did I know that it was on Steam, 4 years later here I am re-playing the campaigns and messing around on custom maps.  12/10"
"This was the first game I ever played at the age of 2 years old. And now, remastered in HD, it is still my favorite game! Amazing new features are always being added for this remastered version and I love it. I give this game a final score of 10/10 for the amazing RTS mechanics that have inspired so many other games."
epic old game
"Wow, even today this game is great fun, but I wish they would make a new one with better graphics and new things, like Starcraft. But still keeping it in the 'old times'. That said this game is great and Awesome fun with friends 8/10 would buy again. -That said this is just my opinion so dont be upset if you disagree- Thanks"
"Always loved this game as a kid, and now I get to play it again in! Hightly recommend for anyone."
"The HD edition of Age Of Empires 2 is actually really well made. I spent hundreds of hours in the original one and I can safely say this is exactly how a proper HD remake should be done. Multiplayer is still laggy sometimes, but apart from that, they took every aspect of the game that wasn't working (such as colors on Windows 7, unless you killed explorer.exe), polished it and sold it. If you liked the original AOE2, you'll love this one."

This game was part of my childhood so I HIGHLY recommend buying it. JUST DO IT!
I recommend this game by its awesome graphics!! omg :O
Great game!! YOU should buy it NOW!
"A trip down memory lane in this classic, strategy game, the revamp done to it is merely an enlargement of population cap, but also, with the mod cons of steam, accessability to mods and players give this game a breath of fresh air. Compared to games of today AoE is a vintage classic, but the joy that it once possessed in it's hayday has now been revitalised with the high definition, and gives players of both new and old a chance to play a game that can still yield a lot of fun."
Great RTS game. Very little game and is very easy to navigate whil eat the same time being complex enough to be fun.
"Great, couldn't ask for much more from an AOE game."
"A game that stands the test of time, I remember playing this when I was a little boy, a brilliant RTS better than 3 in my opinion."
"New graphs, this version is really good."
I remember when I used to play this game as a kid.I'm glad the feeling stayed the same through time and though this new HD version.I recommend this game to anybody who liked the original one or any of the age of empire games (I think the II is the best one).One of the features I like most is the fact that you can now go up to 500 population instead of 200 and it creates a new depth in the game and even more epic battle.And it's always fun to see that there's actually a good amount of server to play in !
"A re-vamping of the classic Age of Empires II (released in 1999), this game offers only cosmetic changes (until you purchase the DLC, and/or mod it up). While the original is a great game, a classic, and will go down in history as one of the greatest RTS' ever made - hell, it revolutionized the entire genre - I only recommend the updated HD version when it is HEAVILY DISCOUNTED.  Everything is exactly the same, but (at the time of writing this - 8 months after release) the multiplayer still has ENORMOUS lag and latency issues that BREAK THE MULTIPLAYER - a huge part of why people want to play this game: with friends.  It gets my recommendation as I have sunk thousands of hours over the past 14 years into the game, and it boasts a damn near perfect single-player experience, but if you're looking at this as your go-to RTS multiplayer game: look elsewhere until the multiplayer lag issues are addressed."
"One of the best RTS games to ever exist, this is one of Microsoft Games' crowning jewels that still holds up to any present strategy game. It is simple on it's surface, but the mechanics and strategy involved are actually quite complex and difficult to master. That said, the controls can be a bit sticky at first, in that placement of buildings is something that you have to be careful about and troop movement can be a little finicky if you are not paying attention.   The tutorials in this teach you all you need to know to jump right into one of the many unique campaigns. If the campaigns aren't your style than there is the free game mode where you can set up your game to play with up to 8 computer or human players (LAN or online, hotseat not supported) on a randomly seeded map or select a specific type, size, and syle of map or even a specific seed in one of the games many different modes. Playing LAN or online is a great way to kill a couple of hours with friends.   Feeling creative? This game also features a custom map option and custom campaign option that is as in depth or shallow as you like. On the maps you can start with a blank slate of any of the standard sizes or you can start with a seeded map that you mod to fit you needs. The campaign builder lets you create objectives and a story to share with the rest of the world or just to play through by yourself or with some friends.  This is a classic RTS that is a great introduction to the genre, one any stratagy game lover sould own, and anyone who likes medieval simulation games can't go wrong with. It has stood the test of time and now with the addition of two new expansions and steam workshop there are almost limitless possibilities.   All in all I would give this game a 10/10."
Reliving the olden days
"Age of Empires II will never die. The best RTS of all time. Used to play it every-day for years. The HD edition is definitely worth it to grab when it goes on sale. The lobby system is great, and games are always available, or easy to create with friends. Can play in actual high-resolution, and a few other tweaks that brings a classic game up to date. My harshest rating would be a 9.9/10 for the fact I get owned everytime on water maps. :P Woo-loo-loo. 14"
Of all Strategy-Games is Age of Empires the classic one. Easy to handle. Nice and interesting campaigns about European and Asian history!  I'm playing Age of Empires 1 + 2 since the release 1997 and 2000. Just awesome! It still makes a lot of fun! Old but gold! :)
The best game of my childhood is still the best game I have ever played.
Best overall game of all time IMO. Started playing it when it first came out on my brickputer and still play it now with my friends and family! Can't wait for African Kingdoms!
"The coolest RTS game that has so many aspects and possibilities. The amount of different Random Maps and their variability will never make a match the same as previous, also the countless Custom Scenarios and Modifications make sure that the fun would last for decades to come."
one of the best strategic games in the world...played since in my childhood and still playin...no regrets i bought this for 20 € :))
If you don't like this game you either have no childhood or are too young to know what good video games are.
"It is simply an HD remake of one of the all time classic real time strategy games. Much fun, 10/10."
"Aaah nostalgia , best stratergy game ever of its kind :D :D:D"
"A defining game in the real-time strategy genre, 'Age of Empires 2' is just as fun now as when it originally came out. AOE2 is great for skirmishes between the 18 different civilizations; something that later entries in the series are severely lacking."
"Age of Empires contains a perfect balancing of micro-management that's easy to learn and a fun challenge to master. It's a four resource game using Wood, Food, Stone, and Gold to build units and research technologies. Villager AI make resources easy to gather with automatic collection after building a resource collection site (ex. build a mine near gold/stone and they gather the nearby gold/stone without command) . Military is based on a 'Rock, Paper, Scissor' system and is explained very well by unit descriptions in game (ex. Pikeman &gt; Cavalry &gt; Swordsman &gt; Pikeman). There are many civilizations each with specialty units and technologies, unique civilization traits, and various access limitations to the primary tech tree. So different civilizations will have varied success to each player based on one's own play style (ex. Huns, which start with max population cap, are great for early game rushing but have difficulty late game against more advanced units since they have very limited tech)."
This Game newer gets old :)
Great game buy it. Classic game remastered making it exceptional. The nostalgic value I got from replaying this was amazing and the replay value of the game makes it a great bang for your buck. I definitely recommend checking the workshop for mods to change some of the textures back to the originals to give it the real feel of the original.
This game bring's back nostalgia!   A awesome game and a fun game to play!
One of the greatest games of all time. I don't think I'll ever tire of it.
"old school game, but still fun to play this real time strategy game.. yeah yeah yeahs !!"
"Great strategy game, highly suggest. :)"
Age of Empires II HD is so friggin' awesome. The details are wonderful. I have been a fan of AOE games since they came out. I have all of the games in their orginial BIG boxes. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves playing strategy games and wants wonderlful details in the game.
Nothing to say: and old school classic remade. Definitely recommended!
"That game makes me remember of my childhood, my stepfather, and a time when the best game is the most fun, not the most graphically beautiful, a shame that I've changed. Great times.  I highly recommend it, for the old times.  "
It's like reliving my childhood except I actually know what I'm doing this time.
Bought it for 4€ Absolutely sucks at Multiplayer Plays only with 1 friend against most easiest bots so I can build nice castles. 10/10
"Easily one of the best RTS games of all time -- right up there with Starcraft. Still tremendously popular and if you get the Forgotten Expansion, you'll love the bit of extra variety it breathes into this old classic.  If you're reading this, you probably alread own the CD version of the game and unless you want to play multiplayer games online, you don't really need the HD version. However, the ease with which you can find games and join lobbies via Steam is well worth the $20 price tag for a game that's older than half my siblings."
the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!
"Amazing rebirth thank you, a good games don't need so much graphic efforts, that are good as they are, learn....... learn."
I strongly recommand that developers can provide option with original hotkeys since most of the players are more familiar with the operations of the non-HD version. :)
best game to ever see the world :D
"Good old childhood right there. Played a couple matches and didn't spot anything going haywire, thus I consider it worth. "
"Good game, good for passing time. More fun with friends (obv).  Don't really like the campaigns but meh.   The way you can edit battles is nice. Suicide mode (you V max # AI) is fun as hell, or you can go casual and learn the tactics of the AI. All in all, fun game."
This game is worth more than it is selling for. I've played this game for years and the HD remake was even better than I expected. The AoE2 online game community is great and if I had the chance I would buy the game all over again.
"Old, old memories!"
Probably one of the best strategy games of all time.
"Beloved game!  It will always have a special place in my heart and in my Steam's library. Even though i own its physical collector's edition,i wanted to buy it here on Steam as well.  It was the least i could do for a gem like this. Childhood memories at its finest..    "
ITs ♥♥♥♥ing sick... Id give up my kids for this
"Honestly, the game is pretty dated. I play it with a friend who played it a long while back.  It's a decently fun game. Nowadays it's simply not good enough to suck me in, make me play it alone as someone new to the series. However, I can see completely why people who liked the game when they were younger would want to play it again, because the game is about as good as these older games get, and is probably exactly what those who played AoEII in the past will expect from it.  -----  Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty satisfying. You build up a small kingdom by constructing various buildings to produce different bonuses for your 'empire.' However, the thrill of seeing the little settlers at work eventually turns into the disappointment of having to actually fight people with a cumbersome system that rewards spamming swarms of units instead of actually having any real tactics whatsoever. If I could give the pre-battle and post-battle parts of each game two separate scores, it'd be 7.5/10 and 4/10, but as it is I'll just give the whole thing a  6/10 .  Graphics/Visual Experience: It's an old game, but it's not hard to tell what's going on. When playing, I do feel 'sucked in' to the game's environment. However, units have a tendency to clump up when there are enough of them (and more often than not, there is), which makes things difficult.  7.5/10   Sound: The game doesn't feel cluttered with unnecessary soundbytes or loud music. The music creates a good feeling but I personally found it grating after a while. The experience, however, is not ruined by Spotify running quietly in the background. It's a game that demands attention, so the game's natural ambiance caters to that requirement.  6.5/10   Replayability: Pretty good. Each game has the potential to play out differently from the one before.  8/10   How it Runs: It's an older game so unless you're trying to run it on a TI-83, it'll probably work."
Wololololo..... This games is awesome! 100/10
one of my favorite games of all time. if you like rts games get this game
Got army of sheep  11/10
"A classic, I remember playing this as a kid. Just as good now as it was then, definitely recommend."
This is a great game to play either alone or with friends. It can get a bit tiring someimesplaying against the computer- it can either be too easy or too hard so I would recommend playing with friends!
No school like the old school!
"Great game, I played it pretty much every day when I was younger. Just as good as I remember it being."
"A true classic of RTS. And I'm not even a RTS lover.   The thing that I love about Age II is the balance. It's advanced enough to be strategically challenging, and simple enough to understand fundamentally what needs to be done with only a playthrough or two.   Basically, building a village with a bunch of houses, then spam several villagers. Villagers collect food, wood, gold, and stone (typically in that order). Then spam buildings. Advance technology. Rinse and repeat. Build an Army/Navy and any defences you can muster. Attack as applicable.  All before the enemy beats you to it, racing against time.  Grab some buddies and crank up the difficulty. You will know stress. And you'll have fun doing it."
"Very well done remake of a classic. The experience is seamless, and brings on all sorts of nostalgia. The only downside is the change to the resource sprites, although you can just download mods to get the orignals."
this game is the one 
Great game.   Use monks they're good.
&gt;Opens game &gt;Plays toturial &gt;Looks for a multiplayer game &gt;100 hours spent looking for a game &gt;Finds game &gt;gets rushed in fudel &gt; uninstalls 
"I'm a big fan of the Age of Empires series, and Age of Empires 2 HD on steam is just as good as the original. I highly recommend it to anyone that love real time strategy games. the 2 expansions are epic too, The Forgotten Empires and The African Kings add some nice touches, civs, techs and units to the game, if anyone gets AOE2HD I'd Highly recommend getting both expansions too."
This game is so much fun.
One of my favorite games of all time!
I built a sheep army. Nuff Said.  Buy this game.
Just as gat dang fun as it was back in the day!
great fun when you play with friends    tough my friends kind of suck atm always playing 2v1 and still winning  r8 it 9/11
Probably The Single Worst Ga...  WOLOLO  Best Game Ever
"Throwback to my early childhood. It's great to be able to play these again, along with the added DLC. Now if only I could remember the cheat codes :D"
Childhood :i
don't let my gametime deceive you i had to have my little brother pull me off the screen so i could return to real life  10/10 would forget i actually have a life again
Brings back the good old memorys. Worth the money.
One of my favourite games hands down.
Still incredible after all these years.
"I have palyed Aoe II for most of my life, it was one of the first games i played. When I found out that they had made an HD edition with an expansion, I jumped to buy iy, now i have grwon to appricate the sheer vastness of opurtunities there are when playing."
"I bought this game when I saw it on Steam, because that was one of my favorite games a few years ago. It also seemed quite nice that the Microsoft doesn't give up the old games, and they see the potential in them. So do I. The content seems a bit little, but hey are working on it to improve! (hopefully)  Overall, I can recommend this game. I had a lot of fun playing it, even 5-6 years back."
29 29 29 29 30
Old game never get bored to replay. Price not broke the bank. Can LAN withput issue.  Worth possess! 7/10
Amazingly addictive its alot of fun.
"Love This Game! Is it Perfect? No, but close! :o)"
this is what you call an all time classic!!!
"A good friend of mine requested I get the game, and I did. For an older game it is quite fun to mess around with and it's worth the money."
It's Age of Empires 2. In HD and with workshop support. Need I say more?
Played this game a long time ago when it was only on CD. Really glad they re-released on steam with better resolutions. I've always enjoyed this game and liked it much better than the sequel.  Haven't checked what it's selling for now but it's worth a play if you have the time or the money.
One of the best If not the best game I have ever played. lots of fun for 15 more years :)
"Simply, this game is AOE 2 with some nicer textures, 1080p support and minimal AI improvements. If you don't have AOE 2, buy this game when it's on sale or something. It's not really worth the default price, but it's still a fun game."
"When I was a young man I always wanted to be a missionary, travel to unknown and exotic places to convert the heathen natives to the greatest religon known to man, Hippieism. However, where would I start? how could I convince Mother Nature's people? These are questions that stoked my mind for ages growing up. My parents bought me this game back when I was only six. At first I was confused, why would a peace loving person play a war game? War, genocide, and conquering are not options of peace. But then I realised my parents knew me better than anyone, this game taught me how to peacefully bring soldiers, citizens, and even inanimate objects, such as catapults together for a common cause, peace. Remember children, Wolololo."
"Massive nostalgic value if you are like me and played this back in the early 2000's, really great game and suprisingly has a strong online community with Steam and Voobly! Definitely worth picking up and even goes on sale for as low as 3-4€ every now and then"
It reminds me of the time when I was a child
"Fun and Exciting RTS game , feels just like it always has , good ole times"
You'll be walking into a fine ♥♥♥ game if you walk into this one
"Age of Empires is  the  RTS game!  Once watched my ally use &gt;80 infantry to chase 5 sheep, a monk, and a trade cart around the map for 20 minutes, whilst I sat behind rows of fortified walls and castles farming and converting enemy houses.  9/10 would forget my military again."
"Very good game to kill time with, a classic that will never die."
"Best game ever! I never get tired of playing this game, for me every match is unique. The only downside is that the multpalyer is sometimes very lagy, fix that and the game is AMAZING!"
"Addicting and fun, but laggy if you play multiplayer with AI."
Great Game!!! Worth it and better to play online with others or friends
"Great, Classic game!!! fun multiplayer!"
"If there's a game that did nearly as well as the 'wololo' of AoE 1, it had to be AoE2. In a rare instance where a successor elevates a well-loved game to the realm of competitive possibilities, AoE2 set the platform for further sequels and while it will never be Starcraft, AoE remains what it is: a forerunner."
"Awesome, great game, good definition, very easy to understand and I suspect I will enjoy it for years to come!"
ages of empire has been one of my all time fav games
"So many childhood memories,,,,"
"Solid game, not alot of bugs anymore, mostly stable online and a whole lot of community content :)  No reason not to buy it if you were a fan or about to become one"
"What a great classic game, I am so glad that they rehab'd it for modern operating systems. Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone!"
"I couldn't be happier with this game. I have a crap ton of nostalgia for this game, and the fact that they actually came out with expansions way after the game came out, just makes me want to play it more. Sadly, however, I doubt anyone new to this game would enjoy it."
I've problably spent 100 hours on this game NOT on the steam one but the original disc one and i can say I LOVE IT i was so sad when i found out my new pc couldnt play it because it was so old then i found the steam verison and its like i saw angels come down from heaven carrying this then i heard a monk and they started beating me wtith the game and then they killed my internet. 5 days later it installed i cheated alot and i installed alot of mods for it....  323454334553fk30kgj040 out of 2 Would play again
Very nice game!
"AWASOME GAME AND THE PLAY'S IS BETTER NOW, BUT FEW THINGS DOESN'T WORK, FIND A WORKER INACTIVE, PRESSING THE BOTTOM DIDN'T WORK. PLAYING 4VS4 THE CONNECTION IS BAD, ANYWAY PLAYING WITH PPL WITH 100 PING MAXIMUM ITS OK.  AMAZING GAME"
"If you do things like work or school or eat or sleep or social life: This game is not for you. Say hello to energy drinks, doritos, and black circles around your eyes."
Amazing game but never play multiplayer. Abusing a few nations will leave you with bored and repetative gameplay. Play only with friends.
"AoE series are very good games, but AoE2 was one of my favorite games when i was a kid. Having the chance to play an HD version of it is completely amazing but also there are new civilizations and unique units you can play with therefore the new content gives you tons of fun."
9/11 Would Wololo again
"Please,solve the LAG!!!"
Very fun game! I've been playing it since the early-mid 2000's back when I had it on an old disc. The game+DLC is worth it if you catch it on sale. The one thing that I loved is how they didn't change anything except for improving the graphics in the game; they made them more HD.   Overall 10/10 A game you should have in your library.
"Hmm... I think this game is good because the game is old and still playable multiplayer.... Graphic is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I think it's great game if you're boring... I'm lover of strategy games... So, my rate is 8/10"
The game of my childhood.
"This is without a doubt the greatest real-time strategy game I have ever played. It's challenging and spontaneous and if I win I feel a grand sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that I did it myself without the game's help. When I lose I don't give up until it's truly over, even if I have to seek refuge in the forest on a far corner of the map with my few remaining villagers and one man-at-arms to defend them, slowly rebuilding my once-great civilization. This game is unbelievably well-balanced - each civilization in the game has its own ups and downs but ultimately it is the player that causes his/her own victory. You can build great fortifications of walls and towers around your city, creating an enormous and impenetrable stronghold. You can chop down an entire forest and manage fifty farms and ten mines, stimulating an economy that will allow you to recover rapidly from countless battles, which will in turn let you slowly weaken your opponents through unrelenting raids. You can act peaceful while amassing a secret army of knights, battering rams, archers, cavalry, and petards (self-destructing bomb guys), then blitzkrieg straight through the middle of somebody's village, destroying houses and mills not because you need to but because you want to, and then when all is said and done tear down every last castle and town center within their walls. You can take an island for yourself and create a perimeter of walls and guard towers along the shore, then defend it with a diverse navy of flamethrower boats and massive warships, occasionally sending a small force of twenty galleons to harass your enemies into submission. You can accumulate enough resources to construct and defend a structure of such greatness that your civilization will eventually be recognized as the ultimate empire, claiming victory by sheer impressiveness. You can have your city study smithing and academics so that despite having the smallest army you may still pose the greatest threat to your enemies. You can BUILD A GREAT WALL. You can practice devout faith in your God, so much so that the soldiers of your enemies will convert and join alongside you in your quest which is truly the most righteous. And if none of that appeals then you can always just say ♥♥♥♥ it and go out with a bang. The possibilities are limitless in this game.   Pros: +you can do virtually whatever you want to succeed +lots of civilizations to choose from with unique technology trees +many difficulty levels for AI if you have no friends +a bunch of story arcs if you want to do something more than just battle (why would you?) +five ways to end a match that I can think of off the top of my head - there are probably more +infinite ways to reach those five ways +custom map maker +you control everything +you can commit genocide and not feel bad about it +great tutorial that nobody ever plays +funny accents in the storylines +many different gamemodes and map styles +wololo  Cons: -in the Crusades storyline you have to play as the Saracens -moving around the map is weird at first -playing against people who are really aggresive in the first 10 minutes (my brother) is really annoying if it happens to you (every single time)  Neutral: =old graphics may bother you if you're a baby who's never played games on a potato before"
Great revamp of an outstanding classic though the optimisation needs to be improved.
"An all-time favorit of mine. Great gameplay, lots of tactical and strategic combat, well researched historic campaigns, and epic multiplayer fun. Enjoy!"
"Absolutely rocks - just like the original but:  more stable, easier to connect to players in a LAN game, better AI, very nice soundtrack and runs fullscreen in 4K.  Also: You can play it with a Wacom tablet if you're old and suffer from RSI ;)  5 Stars - perfect game."
"It's amazing that a 17 year old video game can still keep me enthralled for hours on end. I remember being shown this game at a friends house when I was a teenager, and I was immediately captivated by the medieval setting. I would spend hours in the Scenario maker designing my own medieval lands and the online games I played with my friends were so fun we would talk about it the day after at school. I couldn't wait to get home and play AOE2, again!  I played AOE3 a bit and AOM quit extensively, the latter being a very good game in it's own right, but there's just something about AOE2 that resonates something deep inside me to this day. I didn't know about the HD remake until last year, and when I found it I had to get the game, again! The graphics still hold up, and with hundreds of community mods in the workshop the game has a lot of appeal to almost anyone out there. I'm impressed with the amount of attention Creative Assembly have poured into the game, most notably the new expansions and added units and civilizations, new maps and map sizes, the game really feels twice as much more than it did in the past.  The only thing that irks me about the game, and has done so since day one, are the vast array of units that every civilization shares. There are a few unique units that each civilization has all to their own, but it's still a little off putting seeing an army of European man-at-arms being recruited from a Japanese barracks or swarming the jungles of the Aztecs and Mayans. But that's what AOE2 has always been about, I suppose. It's a small complaint and doesn't take away at all of the true core gaming experience. And with the aforementioned community mods available, a lot of fine folks have alleviated this problem, a bit.   If you're a huge fan of medieval gaming, you may want to check this one out. If you enjoy real time strategy games, well this is one of the most classic examples of the genre and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you passed AOE2 up.  If you can stomach the price for a 17 year old game, it is worth it, but if you're patient enough to wait for it to go on sale it would truly be a steal. It would be most worthwhile to purchase all of the added expansions as well to get the full AOE2 experience. I waited until the Summer Sale because I wanted to also purchase it for my girlfriend, who I am trying to get into the game and although she really doesn't play any games whatsoever, she can't resist just how damn fun this one is, especially playing online, together.   Online is a whole other story. Personally I haven't dabbled too much into online with people I didn't know, as my skills aren't quite up to par to the general level. But I'm starting to be a little more brave and I really don't mind getting my butt handed to me as it's quite a learning experience and still much fun to be had, as long as it doesn't happen too often!  So long story short, if you haven't heard of this game before, get out from under that rock you've been living under and experience one of the most timeless, funnest, most in depth games ever created. And for those who have played the original before but felt they've grown out of it, well be prepared to spend more countless hours falling in love with it all over again, as I have!"
"Playing this game is very nostalgic for me, It reminds me of before high school when I would have lan parties with my friends. Mechanics are so very good though, so the playability is still there, and I'm finally diving into the game more and learning the good shortcuts"
"I was fan of the original Age of Empires (AOE) release. When AOE II came out it was sluggish on my PC and the bigger size of persons and buildings on the lower resolutions of 1999 monitors made everything very crowded.  Today, the HD versions not only looks good (AOE hasn't aged in my opinion), but it feels lightweight and --most importantly-- certainly not overcrowded.  A must have if you like strategy and certainly if you prefer Real Time instead of Turn Based."
The orignal farmville
Best RTS ever.  Still played by thousand of players 15 years after the release. The bad point is that it's very addictive. Try it and you'll never want to play another RTS.
"This game is the best stragey game I have ever played! Even though this is a 10 year old game, it is AMAZING to play. It is also awesome if you have alot of friends who have this game."
"I was playing the game for about 10 minutes then got raided and destroyed.   I was confused why I was so brutally attacked by militia cavemen dudes, so I went back to check my settings. Apparently while I wasn't looking, I changed the map size to smallest with 8 players and on the hardest difficulty.  10/10 would militia again."
"One of my favourite games from my childhood, it still brings the nostalgic feeling and a wonderful presence even when playing it now. With the refurbished and now HD resolution, it's a must buy for those who loved and still enjoy the game as much as me. "
The One Real Time Strategy to rule them all. The Pioneer. The Master. The All-father. The Almighty. O Rei da ♥♥♥♥♥ toda!
This is the best game ever
"If you've ever been a fan of the Original then you'll love the HD version. Fantastic gameplay, multiplayer, and integrated Twitch streaming all make this classic truly great."
Why the f*** not? 
Played this for hours back in the days Great game!
This game is Amazing! I use to play it as a kid back in the day and when I saw steam had it it was a no brainer to buy it!
Spawned in. Couldn't remember how to do anything. Enemys at imperial age while im at dark. get ♥♥♥♥♥ with arrows 10 minutes in. 10/10
"Incredible throwback to a forgotten age of videogaming with some minor tweaks, texture updates, and massive commmunity support. Love this game."
"Used to play this when I was 5 years old or so. After more than 12 years it still offers great RTS experience and nostalgia, although the HD version could have been much better: the game is virtually untouched, save the resolution and steam integration. Still, at -75% it is quite reasonably priced and yes, I recommend it."
"Nostalgia.... bring back good memories. And now that it has a strong support team, the game is constantly improving. Can't wait for the next expansion... Africa, here we go!"
awesome old school classic highly recomended 10/10
Best strategy game there is
1080P AoE2 with no bugs on new systems.
Now HD being fine Patch 4.3.
"It's still the same awesome game, fifteen years later. If that doesn't sell you, then the fact that there are all kinds of awesome mods in the workshop and all the neat Steam advantages you'd expect are now part of it, will."
All I can say is AoE is a masterpiece. Props to Steam for remaking the HD version...not to mention boosting the annoying 200 population cap to 500!
An amazing and fun game! Great to play Solo or with Friends!!
Hands down the best game ever. Would get rushed again 10/10
"I completely love this game. I played it for first time like 10+ years ago, now in HD with the expansions I totally love it. You'll never get bored of playing this. In my opinion, this is the best strategy game ever. GET IT!!!!"
You will hate fireboats.
"NOTE: I only have about 14 hours on steam but I have 60+++ hours in a version off steam.   Pros- Lots of Civilsations Lots of Replay Value Great Campaigns Interesting Narrative for some campaigns Very Stratigic Atmospheric Great mapping community for custom maps Multiplayer is actully quite far from extinction , however you need to be seriously good at the game to not get destroyed. Makes you feel like a Warlord attacking in a huge army (Up to 500 units under some settings in custom match)  Cons-Some Narative for some civ campaigns is very boring and I love history so im 50/50. Outdated Sounds Pros Outweigh the cons for sure. Buy it today. EDIT: Made a mistake on my review, now fixed."
STRATEGY CHECK CAMPAIGNS CHECK AWESOME MULTIPLAYER CHECK CHILDHOOD MEMORIES CHECK AND AND AND........ WOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO CHECK WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED :V 
"Buy this game. Buy it. It's so good, force your friend to play with you. You'll both love conquering enemies, single player is kind of boring but multiplayer is the best."
its a game
"You've played Age of Empires, I'm sure. If you havn't, then I simply don't know what to say.  Well this is AoE2, in full HD with gorgeous water textures and an increased pop cap.  Including as well, steam's famously prolific mod community and integrated online with your Steam friends list, it's guarunteed hours and hours of fun and wololo."
How can you dislike the 'KING' of strategy games
"Firstly, the metascore for this game (For those who care) is misleading. The game as you remember it is quite well intact, and good as ever it was. However, the transition to Steam and 'HD' is very underwhelming. It offers very little that makes it worth its price tag should you already own it (And cetain 'Expansions' from elsewhere) and what is does offer is often disappointing. The HD, while nice, is almost unoticeable from the original. The online play, which I would venture many desire from this, is unimpresive and fickle to work with. Steam Workshop so far does not seem to add much to the game either, aside to make minute changes, the return a lot of the smaller HD changes to their previous form. Strangely, AoE suffers from problems that you would think extinct in this age. There are issues with it no properly accessing multople CPU cores, causing clientside lag, and issues with connectivity causing Desyncs and connection lag.   In summary, the game itself is about as fine as it ever has been, and its expansion is enjoyable, but unless you suffer compatibility issues you can't be bothered to or otherwise lack the capacity to figure out (Like myself) you would be better off with the original. If you are simply looking for a way to bring AoE to the Steam community and play with friends then yes it does that and I recommend it for you."
You know you want to...
Good game sahn get it or quit ya know wut im sayin'
"don`t look at the metascore and think this game is bad, because it`s actully a really great game!"
Get this!!!!
Classic strategy game that never gets old. I had played this years back when it was just new and i loved it then and i still do. 
One of the best Strategy games I've ever played in my childhood and now so on. You should really give it a try!!! NOW  PS. I wish they would release the HD Edition for AoE 1 too.
"One of my favourite all time RTS games. It is still enjoyable to play for hours . It has set standards for the rts genre , and although younger people may find the graphics outdated , I'd sure recommend giving it a try. It has been revamped and given a new life with the HD edition. Now higher resolutions have native support and through steam its really easy to set up multiplayer games."
One of all time favorite games. The HD version just makes it look that much nicer. It might be me but I think they increased the AI also. Moderate is more like Hard from the past versions.
"I love this game. It brought back my childhood game. Though in this version, screen is totally zoomed out and it's kinda irritating my eyes. I don't know how to fix this issue. However, this classic strategy game will keep you up for hours of gameplay since the population limit is up to 500. 4/5stars"
"It is one of the best strategy games that ever existed . Is not expensive and you can have so much fun playing it with friends and other people . It also teach you about history , the history of many empires and things like this ."
Wololo
"One of the best games/series ever made! Love it, except the map editor is very confusing and hard. Actually i should say 'scenario editor', should just have an easy to make map editor tbh.  9.9/10 (if u make a better map editor, 10/10)"
An all time great!! Can play for hours!! Awesome game!!
10/10
"its a good game, good community, good fun"
"Very fun game, I enjoyed it for years when I was little and I had long since lost it, so I was super happy to see it come out in HD. The graphics literally made me want to cry out with joy. This game is the perfect mix of nostalgia that I remeber with new added game play."
"class,brings back memories :)"
"Great game if you played it in your childhood and are looking for nostalgia or even if you've never played before but be careful if you buy it. There are still several issues that are slowly, very slowly getting fixed via patches that are considerably spaced out.   Edit 5/12/14: I've had this game since the day it came out, and in the past year and a month, the developers have made significant improvements to this game. One such being an actual attack move command, and various other things such as bug fixes. They released an expansion to the game, as well as many free campaigns. One of the best things about this game is the Steam Workshop which adds many useful mods or user-made campaigns and scenarios. I would still recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale. There have been many sales in which AoEHD2 is $5, and with the expansion is $7.50 or somewhere around that price. Definitely worth waiting until this Summer for the sales, rather than spending $30-35 dollars in my opinion."
Played this on my dad's old Compaq laptop. Found it on Steam and bought it and it's still amazing. Warning: everyone will be better than you online.
-Send a villager to build a wall -5 wolves attack villager  10/10 would send more villagers to their death
I'm never prepared for the feudal rush.
'WOLOLO!' Simulator HD Edition. Now with African 'WOLOLO!'.
"The latest update for this game just ruined it for me! I hope they fix it. It used to run beautifully with max players and max units. Now it LAGS horribly to the point it's unplayable. To add to this, the Idle Villager button is broken and the map maker is ruined. It's sad to see a game I have come to love since I was a child be ruined because some spoiled brat was unhappy with the water graphics... seriously? It's about the gameplay over all. Graphics come second to that.   Anyway, I hope they fix it and from what I have been told, they will. Play it with few people and just be patient. Woo!"
Made me harder than a horse ♥♥♥♥. 10/10
"Want some nostalgia? You came to the right place. Same game, but with development, weekly updates and all of the things that a current gen game gets."
"The game crashes after about fifteen minutes when i try to play multiplayer, so its pretty much unplayable. This trend started when you released the african kingdoms patch. But its all worth to get mi african bruddahs in da game. 10/10.  No but seriously please fix the multiplayer from crashing."
The best in this category. Good memories! 10/10
Best Game Of The Ages
if this was a bad game it would be a bad bad game.   which means ot would be a good game because it's a bad bad game
This game was my first game of my life and i am still playing. There is no explanation for this game. Just WOLOLO
Best RTS of all time
"YES! just yes. it's Age of Empires II + Steam bonuses (achievements, trading cards, workshop, playing with friends, etc.). BUT buy it only for full price !! IT IS WORTH !!!"
One of the best RTS games ever made! Even though it has been more than 15 years since its realease it's still very actual today. A game that inspired all the RTS games that came after. A most have for all RTS lovers!
I loooooove this game i really do BUUUUUUUUUUT why does every patch ♥♥♥♥ing reks it?????? im not bale to finish a single ♥♥♥♥ing game FIX IT U ♥♥♥♥ER FIX IT
Despite getting rekd within the first 20 minutes of playing an online match it's still great fun!
10/10 would go on my friends laptop and press del again!
"Age Of Empires is a really fun game if you are into the strategy games! Only problem is whenever I load the game there is no sound :(, even when my volume is turned up all the way. Has anyone else had this problem or is it just me. Other than that I love this game and I enjoy playing as the Portuguese, I rate this 9/10."
"Wrecked Mayans, Indians and Vikings in Texas with my Teuton army.  10/10"
My favorite game of all time.  War Elephants OP.  Multiplayer almost as laggy as Iron Warriors: T - 72 Tank Command  10/10
My favourite part is that Aztecs can convert a Siege Workshop to their religion in order to use it themselves.
"if only there were more games like this around, beautiful multiplayer and gameplay. Why ensemble, why you leave the industry."
Roses are red. Violets are...    WOLOLOOO    Roses are now blue.
"When playing with friends, this is the best Game of Thrones simulator out there.  *Rains of Castamere plays*  And then there was an army of paladins invading my lands."
This game is my childhood. This game still has a strong online community and the developers are still realeasing expansions 15 years after release!
"Ive always liked RTS games especially the age of empires series and the warcrft series, I have had this game for a long time and have played 200+ on my pirated version but finally got this game with $$$ cus i just have loved it so much. AoE games are must buys, it has steam workshop aswel so thats fully siick, this game is amazing. Get it... You need it... 9.5/10 Amazing game"
yeah its alright
destroyed my childhood  11/10 would destroy it again

Been playing this game since i was 4yrs old and every match still makes me kek hard as ♥♥♥♥
This has been the best of all strategies for more than 10 years'
I really love this game it's so much fun!!
"One of the games that has aged the best, ever. Despite being so old, this game still remains as good as ever. HD edition just adds more awesomeness to an already amazing game. Newer updates have made the game very stable on steam and have decently patched up the age old problems of lag and bad multiplayer experience, leading to a very smooth online experience for this game. With a really large online community for this game, it's not short on players at all.  I highly recommend this game for being such a classic and deep game that has endless replay value, and such a wide variety of playing styles and game modes that it simply never runs out. 10/10. "
"An amazing remake to the original series. However, the major changes are to the game's engine, the graphics, and the soundtrack. And let me just say, all of the listed above are improved vastly. AI is a bit more intelligent and animations are great. One of my personal favorite parts is the soundtrack! More often than not my friends and I would be humming the tune playing for all of us in synch which was a great addition and remains one of my all time favorite game soundtracks. The graphical touch ups are phenomenal as well. Fires, explosions, and projectiles all look great in comparison to the original AoEII. Everything else is pretty much the same with the game, but now includes Steam Workshop and more modding capabilities.   AoEII HD Edition is like rediscovering your old bicycle, riding it, and finding the ride is just as smoothe as you remember it."
Empires rise! Empires fall!  But you remain.  Now in HD !   10/10 nostalgia!
wow i can't believe bill gates single handedly made this game
this game is so much fun with friends!!! 
The only game where i can easily 1v3 my friends. 10/10
"I have played Age of Empeiers since I was little kid, and this is a HD Edition, just a few little tweaks from the none HD one. It does a little better, but not the best High Definition. Hope you people will enjoy the game!  -Kristian"
this game is good its AoE II  JLANE SUCKS BALLS
9/10  Would give it 10/10 but it was too graphically intense for my computer.
The best strategy game ever !
this is the best game of the world who agreeeeeeeees
"One of my favourite games of all time! While some of the improvements may seem a bit off at first such as the fire, being able to play this in HD via steam is so worth it!!!"
"A classic one, no doubt all shall own it! (good for teaming up and fighting!)"
"This was the first game I ever played at the age of 2 years old. And now, remastered in HD, it is still my favorite game! Amazing new features are always being added for this remastered version and I love it. I give this game a final score of 10/10 for the amazing RTS mechanics that have inspired so many other games."
Of all Strategy-Games is Age of Empires the classic one. Easy to handle. Nice and interesting campaigns about European and Asian history!  I'm playing Age of Empires 1 + 2 since the release 1997 and 2000. Just awesome! It still makes a lot of fun! Old but gold! :)
10/10 would wololo again
Best RTS ever! wait StarCraft is the best!
This game is game of my life.I think i will never stop playing AoE II.Since microsoft studios is back I hope that one day they decide to make fourth game.
"Without doubt, the best strategy game out there that has stood the test of time for years and will continue to do so. Still updated now and again and still has quite the large community. Never short of joining lobbys and never short of fun and interesting match ups.  11/10 will play for over 600 hours again.  Wololo."
old but cool

"Much nostalgia, very strategy.   Get this game if you liked slash owned the original!"
Absolutely phenomenal. Oh the nostalgia of completely dominating your friends with an army of Cars :')
"Made a monk army, and changed the world"
I can hit buildings with swords and they catch on fire.   10/10
"Hours and days of my childhood spent on this game... It is simply the best strategy game from it's time. C&amp;C has Red Alert 2, but AOE2 has much more strategy out of the campaigns and a harder AI and tech tree to master. There are a plethra of different civilizations to choose from, and if you own The Forgotten, you get some neat new civilizations with awesome buildings and units that make you feel bad and go back to the original, more balanced game.  It is also worth noting that the game now supports up to 1000 units instead of the original 75 (200 with the Conquers expansion pack) but it is not balanced. The defense and attack of units and building doesn't change and being designed for 200 not much more, you will find yourself needing human walls instead of towers, castles, and walls. This could've been avoided by restricting the extra units to the DLC I talk about below, but why balance the game for more units in the DLC since it would be far easier than adjusting the original (since the new special units can be quite overpowering at times) and would give me a reason to set the population higher and use the DLC more.  My only complaint is that the DLC (The Forgotten) they added when they remastered the game has no voice acting, and I felt the campaigns were designed to show what the DLC had to offer and the capabilities this game has on newer machines. I couldn't finish any of them because they didn't have the same tempting gameplay that attracted me to the originals (and the Conquers addition).  Other than that, I wish the multiplayer would give the choice to be hosted locally or on a server somewhere else to reduce lag (something AOE3 has if you register for some third party blah blah blah)."
"first playing online with sum strangers, they said' wants to make alliance with me, k, go for neutral, they give me instruction for coming to their castles (look suspicious), but k, and then suddenly changed their faction to be my foe, k, i died.  10/10 would get betrayed again"
Fun and great game!
It's okay I guess.
The game where u can beat any empire with a big ♥♥♥ with just a monk that collects relics. INSTA GG  10/10 would go Monk only again
"Best game I have ever played.  I put just about 32 hours on it in the first 2 days of buying it. I haven't seen the sun in weeks and my friends think I'm dead. My body has adapted to where I can receive energy from the lightbulbs in my room, almost like photosynthesis. I have received approximately 4 hemorrhoids in the last week because the only time I leave my seat is when I reset my router. I can't sleep at night anymore because everytime I shut my eyes I hear my town center's bell ringing in my head. But other than that this is a great game. 10/10"
I was able to make suicide bombers as the byzintine empire. They did more damage than trebuches. Watch out elephants! MOBLIE MEDIEVAL BOMBS INCOMING 11/10 great game. Fun Laughs and difficult at times.
"When I was a wee lad this game had barely come out, fast forward to today and it still grabs me the same way like an uncle trying to sexually abuse me. This game is easilly one of the worlds best RTS games, the gameplay and multiplayer can make you want to get better or even want a newer game to come out just like it. AOE2 captures your attention with its easy to use unit creation and the ability to create an empire that will ♥♥♥♥ your opponents ♥♥♥♥ up. or if your like me, lose everything and ♥♥♥♥ someone off by using one unit to rebuild it all and ram them from the back! get it, have fun with friends as you all join a multiplayer gangbang and may the best man get his ♥♥♥♥ kicked in first."
"Did you enjoy the original AOE 2 or just enjoy strategy games in general, well then you're in for a treat! This game has graphics you can compare with battlefield, crysis or any other modern game with a huge focus on grapichs! What enginge does it run on you ask, well I dont know, but you can probably compare that enginge with any of the great game engines today, the HD remake buts the HD in HD! Besides being SUPER ULTRA HD, the gameplay 'the most important part' is almost imposible to describe, but here goes... I guess you can compare to great games like: Last of us, Fallout, Skyrim, Battlefield, Call of Duty, Boredlands, Minecraft or GTA 5. Then theres the story, the campaign! One word WOW, well I havent played it, but I bet you can compare it with some game with a great story.   My verdict: This game can be compared with great games grapichally, story wise and on a gameplay level... but in my opinion it doesnt hold up... 3/10 and dont be folled by the HD in the title, thats BS this game is as HD as, well compare it to something that isnt very HD"
"This game can be a blast if you play it with a group of people that you know. It doesn't stack up to the Total War series in terms of strategy and singleplayer engagement, but it's a nice break that still gives a real time strategy experience. It's a base recruitment --&gt; army building game, so it's based around a land and unit rush principle that I don't enjoy very much. It's difficult to learn, even from experienced players, because you aren't able to get a feel for the progression of the other players during gameplay. I'd recommend finding either a similarly skilled group or a mentor if you want to be competetive."
Simply one of the best computer games ever made.
"When I was a kid I would play this game all the time. Now I bought it for the second time because I wanted to remember those times spent on this game with my friends. However this time, the servers or people to play with are hard to find. The graphic looks the same as in old AoE but now you can run it on latest computer."
"Amazing game! I remember my childhood playing this on a CD with my best friend. We bought the remastered version on Steam and relived old times. Great to experience it again, despite its old and outdated mechanics it is still one of the best strategy games to grace the gaming world. Buy this game, but only if your fine with an old but glorious strategy game."
"Its good game if you are bored and want to waste some time,preferring to play with your friends tho :)"
"Expected a bit more of this game than just HD retexture, like new campaigns though! With some mods and a little fuss with resolution it's the same old AoE2)"
"Instant RTS classic right here. Be careful of the campaign and AI, they are relentless and push to no other extent you have ever seen!"
I fap to this game.
One of the firsts and best real-time strategy game that stills looks pretty awesome to play nowadays!
This game is amazing. Ignore the last review as it turns out it was optimised for windows 10.
this is awesome brings back my memories at my childhood
Being a 10 year player of this game will certainly be a thumbs up for me but Age of Empires II has been one of the best RTS games ever I highly recommend this game for any veteran players or the newbies!
one of the best multiplayer games ever
"It is a rather poorly executed HD remake (On many objects i dont even recognize a difference) of one of the best RTSGs that exist. Therefore it is still worth it. There is a new addon dlc, the devs were too greedy to make it for free.. who can blame them.. I find AoE2 is kinda out of time and the remake was kinda unnecessary, but hey! one of the games i loved as a child I still bought it and played it for the good old times sake."
I swear im going to nut on someones toe if they dont give some wood AT LEAST
A true classic. My first PC game.
"Classic RTS game. talking about HD steam release, it has improved graphics, steam intregration, mods, overall decent. if you look for a more competitive enviroment you should play on voobly"
&gt;starts to play game &gt;does tutorial &gt;uses sheep to attack &gt;sheep die &gt;cries over sheep and quits &gt;goes into steam and get a new item &gt;card 'King of Memes' &gt;starts up game again &gt;sends a giant army on last mission &gt;dies by the castle because castle op 11/10 would get Memed again
" EN   First and foremost, I have to confess that, sadly, I'm really useless when it comes to play these kind of games; I'm awful. However, Age of Empires II has become a chapter in my life, and it's really worth the money.  I've had long and endless hours of joy and laughters thanks to the mythic 'wololo' and to the hordes of elephants that made great effort to catch that sneaky villager that was hiding behind the trees. Moreover, it has significantly improved my knowledge and my interest into Europe's medieval history (no joking). Despite being a stone in the way for my allies, and despite knowing nothing about war games, I've had really good moments with my friends playing this. I totally recommend it.  Besides, the most important thing is that, with this version, you can play now through Steam, which really helps with online issues and make playing with friends much easier. The 'HD' they announce is quite disappointing, but that isn't important at all since it doesn't really change the price. It does not change my opinion on this PC legend. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ES   Antes de empezar, he de confesar muy a mi pesar que soy un pedazo de inútil y un completo estorbo en este tipo de juegos. Ahora bien, Age of Empires II es un capítulo en mi vida y una compra que verdaderamente ha merecido la pena. No solo me he reído incontables horas con el clásico 'wololo' y las armadas de elefantes y catapultas que se cebaban con mi pobre aldeano escondido tras el bosque; también me he sumergido más en la historia de Europa (lo digo totalmente en serio) y me he divertido muchísimo con mis amigos a pesar de ser un aliado totalmente inerte.  Además, crear casitas y hacer mi ciudad bonita es algo muy atractivo. Lo recomiendo muchísimo. Su antigüedad no es para nada un inconveniente.  Por otro lado, la versión 'HD' no es nada del otro mundo. El hecho de que esté en Steam facilita muchísimo el juego online, eso sí; y es un dinero que merece la pena pagar. Pero vamos, la 'alta calidad gráfica' es un engañabobos. Pero nada de esto es algo que afecte a mi opinión de este clásico de los juegos de PC."
"I've played this game since I was probably about 5 or 6. We had one computer in our house in Ireland at the time (my dad bought the game for us), and me and my 2 brothers played it on rotation even though we never had any real idea what we were doing. When we moved to the United States this game was lost for us, because the CD was ruined on the trip. After a few years of withdrawl, our father bought us AOE III. Although I loved that game as well, it just wasnt the same. We only recently picked up AOE II again, but the love never really left. For me and my brothers, this game is timeless. I am 17 now and my older brother is 18, he is in college and we still play this game together. Needless to say, I have an extremely positive view on this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games."
There will never be a better game than this. It's fun to play as a beginner and then it just grows. Best RTS ever made. The only negative thing is that new players online start with 1600 ELO (ranking) and that is very high so prepare to lose and lower your elo if you are a new player. This game will never die.
"Ah, where to begin? Age of Empires was my childhood, and it still is a favorite. It is a simple layout, understandable controls, and those simple graphics that just DO IT for this old game. Hours and Hours of replayability, and never ending excitement. Age of Empires has never disappointed before, and Im sure this remake will only make its legacy greater."
"One of my past childhood favorites, worth the money spent, especially when it's put upon sale.  Historical accuracy? For the most part, yes. Even the way they died is often accurate. It's mainly reenacting the famous battles during the middle ages, with you acting as the commander. There are some instances that aren't as accurate. The new expansion adds five more nations to the fold, effectively making it so there is twenty-three nations in total. Whereas the best part is that despite having the same generic units, and having only one or two unique units to each and their own.  The outcome of the battle can truly be decided with what technology and talents each and every civilization holds, and how much you use it to your advantage.. Where each civilization has four or five, maybe even six bonuses, one of those bonuses going to the team it's on, and itself. They have one unique technology exclusive to it's own nation, and one or two unique units depending on the civilization itself. Not only that these special units are powerful in their own field, but they're exclusive to your nation and anyone else being of the same nation. Therefore making it so the only way to get those units when not being of that nation is to convert them.  Each civilization has it's own playstyle, defensive or offensive, no matter what, you need to use those traits to an entire advantage. On top of that, said civilizations have their own technology trees, which has some historical inaccuracy, sadly. Though these trees balance the game a little as well. Though when in control of a civilization, you need to know not only it's strengths, but it's flaws, and how to combat them.   The HD version changes actually, very little of the same, safe for graphics that were revised, the gameplay and controls were not touched one bit, therefore allowing any Age of Empires veteran to join in the fun.   The new expansion is worth it, by adding more civilizations, technologies, and units to play around with. So with that, this game is good for those who love a historically accurate real-time-strategy type game. Where each and every civilization has those aforementioned strengths and difficulties.  So, what are you waiting for? Hit that green button."
"The walls are amazing, the only reason I play is to make trump proud with my wall. #Latinosfortrump"
I created a monk army and I converted the enemy's elephants to christianity. 11/10 would wolololo again.
Age of empires II HD looks very similar to Age of empires II. The gameplay is the same. I really liked Age of empires II too. there are some minor tweaks to Age of Empires II HD like a higher population limit. There is just one downside. There is no lan option. I really like playing lan with friends.
Wonderful game.
"'Old, but Gold.' as my little brother would say. This, Starcraft, and Red Alert were my first Real Time Strategy games, and because of these wonderful games I still love and play RTS and different types of strategy games.  That was in the mid to late 90's though. Suprisigly this game holds up. More so than Starcraft and Red Alert.  It is a wondeful RTS if you can get past the graphics, which aren't horrible, just a bit outdated.  A good buy."
"Good, for me was the same thing that the not-HD version... Nice multiplayer, I was the pirate and i Buy only for it."
"I am a cosnole gamer and I play as many pc games as possible. Age of empires is one of them.I always wanted to play this game!  It's a really smart game.You have to think which will be your next move .Doing something wrong could be a diasaster. There are not many games like age of empires and that's why I believe every gamer should play this one! 8,5/10"
"As great as the original version, only with a few bells and whistles added.  For a long time I've been thinking whether I liked this game or warcraft 3 more. Right now, I still can't decide. This game definitely has the best balence for RTS games ever, the races are all complex and diverse, adjustable population limit, every single unit is important; all units have the same population cost, but the game is so balenced, that you don't just immediately go for the siege weapons, and you still have a need for ordinary soldiers. Oh, and never before had I played a game that actually made me want to learn more about each of the civilizations. The best part about it, is because it's not very mainstream you won't get your ♥♥♥ kicked online because all the people from south korea stay on starcraft 2.  Warcraft 3 may have better potential for custom games, but this is for people who want an old-fashioned RTS. 5 stars"
All i can say is that you have to play this game it is so epic...  Everything is good if you do not know nothing about this game it is simple...  this game have campaign that you need to advance to finish the game and have a standard game...  storyline is good and epic. Standard game... You play against computer or other players and try to win the game.  this game you start with a building called by Town Center that you can generate people and start to building stuff...  you can build armies and put down the other teams to conquer the map!  amazing that is all i can tell!
Love playing this game with my friends. Despite being an old game it is one of the best ones I've ever played if you love real time strategy (RTS) games then this is the game for you. It is a bit pricey I must say but it is worth it.
"The fact that there is an official expansion to a game this old ought to give you an idea of what a timeless classic this truly is. While it may not have the bells and whistles of more recent RTS games, the balance, the mechanics, and the setting all make for one of the best RTS games ever made."
'Loved this game before i had pubes... Shtill love it' -Sean Connery
i love this game 
"Age of Empires is undoubtedly best game in history of mankind, thats why I am so dissapointed that I suck at it and get beaten up by AI. Well, considering the fact that chess world champion got beaten up in chess by AI as early as 1997 I shouldn't be so upset, guess I'll try again..  .. *30minutes later*   Somehow AI converted my catapults to Islam!  Can't even imagine what would happen if Islamic State would convert our nuclear warheads to Islam.  Guess warfare is not for me, I'll just enjoy exploring map with my sheep."
best game 10/10 never felt so good winning against bots
collect the most rc sheep and bring them to your base unharmed to win the game   sheep/10
"This game is almost as old as I am, and it still ROCKS!!!"
Really awesome this game still after 12+ years. I played this game 12+ years ago and thought yesterday lets buy it again and have some fun whooo whoo still cool
One of the (if not THE best) RTS of all time
Childhood game right here!
"This is a very educational game. The first thing I learned is that, if I were a medieval king, I would have gone down in history as the most incompetent, tyrannical dunce to ever lead a civilization (to its demise, that is). I expected to have the military prowess of Tywin Lannister, only to find out I am as skilled a strategist as Leeroy Jenkins.   Yet, once you get the hang of the gameplay, you can enjoy success of your people. Build a wonder, or just raze those other civilizations to oblivion because they had the audacity to be different from yours."
10/10 would steal my allies relics again
"Works on Windows 10, does crash sometimes during cutscenes or trying to join a lobby for multiplayer but overall very solid game from the past."
ALL HAIL KING OF THE LOOSERS!! 'Gets rushed by massive army' AAAAH
"It's AoE II, need I say more?"
a blast from the past!  
"Age of empires is the kind of game that everybody must have, nothing like a rain of arrows from the britons longbow."
A faithful HD remake of the original Age of Empires 2.   A must have for fans.
"Let's you live out your weeaboo fantasies by playing as the Japanese, even if it's 1,500 years early."
"Not much to say apart from I play it with my friends, and its really fun :D"
ITA GE OF EMPIRES FOR CRY ME RIVER its pretty g00d 11/100 i guess the ai is stupid and u may have to remov sone of ur frends becuz they kewl u
my 27 hours in detail.......i made a massive army of 200 villagers... sent them to war.... got smashed by one prick with a longbow.... 5/10 would try again but cant afford to make another 250 villagers gold is hard to find these days with all my miners dead
"Its a great classic, voice acting for the campaign is great too, 3 could be better but its personal preference and taste."
WoloWoloWoloWoloWoloWoloWolo/10
How do you turn the nostalgia off
it's like if clash of clans if clash of clans wasn't ♥♥♥♥
Overall excellent. I played this game all through high school and now that there are Steam Achievements it's even more fun than before. It's also nice that the system requirements aren't too demanding since I have a 6 year old laptop I can take with me on business trips and play AoE2 in the hotel (provided the hotel has a decent internet connection).
"Okay, I start out buliding stuff and blah blah blah and then, out of nowhere these yellow idoits start attacking me. Okay, ill just build a wall. Later these guys start finding exploits in my city. I say okay,okay,okay ill built another wall. They sneak around AGAIN! They kept doing that for awhile. 10/10"
'how do you turn this on'
First time playing   1 Ok this game is cool 2 hey that's my gold stand down 3 oh crap those were my allies well just one less place i have to destroy 4 crap killing everyone is not how you win 5 everyone hate me kill them 6 everyone's dead  7 so lonely
OMG !!! this game is so good that i builded a castle and a castle camp you should play this game it is soooo good bye bye 
Food Please 10/10
after 5 hours of gameplay against british 'You are Victorious!' score 'Achievements disabled due to cheats activated in game'  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
10/10 would wololo again in HD.
This game SU-(WOLOLO)-THIS GAME IS AMAZING!
great game
"Have been playing this game since microsoft server sooo long ago but steam have done a fantastic job with it and i still enjoy playing it ,fantastic game that has stood the test of time :)"
Its AoC remade for newer systems and new dlc has been made available. A game already immune to time now is back with a fire and newer and more diverse gameplay. Truly an iconic game. 10/10
This game's multiplayer is so amazingly good that I had to play 400 hours before I finally uninstalled it. Phhhhew
Very fun strategy game. Very excited to play this with my steam friends. Love the medieval setting as opposed to AoEIII
I am sure you have read many of the negative reviews. The 3.1 patch helped immensely in solving the of the bugs. At the point there is a plan for a 3.2 patch that will fix even more. At this point I would say this game is worth buying
Feels like I am in High school again :D
"So many good memmories from this game... my freakin childhood! i used to play this game alot, and the magic is still there, the amazing gameplay is still there... now all is left to do is to buy it, SO GO AND BUY IT FFS!  9.5/10 (im not giving it 10/10, because c'mon, where the hell is the HD? it looks exactly the same)"
This is the best the series has to offer. It costs too much though.
"Countless hours have been spent playing AoE2 with both friends and family, and it's always tons of fun. The gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to learn, yet deep enough for dynamic gameplay that requires planning and adaptability, with many viable tactics and counter-tactics.  A timeless classic, and easily one of the best real-time strategy games I have ever played."
"Sheeps are the best scouts, Monks can sing to a house so it becames friendly. 11/10 would wololo again."
GOOD!!!..I think
so excited to see they brought my childhood back!!!
I rate this game 10/10. Best strategy game ever.
Its a classic yo.
"A great game  Literally everything could be improved in AoE2, but then again the game is extremely old and I don't have any expectations of that.  Sad to see that there are no Age Of Empires games released to mimic the classic feel of the original trilogy."
build some ♥♥♥♥
Geat game fun to play thats all just a great game
"Fat king on foot outspeeds cavalry. Villagers attack with knives, despite hunting with bows. Aztecs vs. Huns in Texas. Light cavalry costs food only, even to make its sword and armour. Buildings and siege weapons have religous persuasions and thus can be converted. Most buildings clearly made out of stone but cost wood.  8/8 m8, would recommend.  How do you turn this on?"
"Absolutely love the fact that this retro game is back in HD.. Multiplayer occasionally lags or sometimes freezes. The dlc's are worth buying.. If you have never played this back in the 90's, it might test your patience.. So increase the game speed and play"
"Since I played Age of Empires 2 demo when I was 12 years old, I fell in love with this game, when I reach 16 and I forgot this game forever, until today and it became the classic game of all time, even one of the retro games of all time."
"I loved this game as kid, and now I have it again :D"
Fight me.  jk I'm ♥♥♥♥ at this game.
Ahh the memories.... Last game i had was at a LAN for over 4 and a half hours... pff its fun  Graphics = 5 Music = 7 Story = 4 Controls = 7 Gampeplay = 7

French surrendered  10/10 realism
Like Skyrim with Mongolians.
you can sink ships by converting them to christianity
Great game
Very good game. Brings back many memories from my chilhood with my father.
Loving it!
My only assumption as to why you would not already own this game is that you have a mental or physical disability inhibiting you from making the purchase.
"I LOVED this game ever since I was twelve. So many memories. This is a great strategy game that really feels like you're running a kingdom. You have 4 resources, many different kinds of military, and endless things to do. The addition with researching really adds to the difficulty of the game. It starts to become a race to whoever gets to the next 'age' so you get more options faster. The added online play that Steam gives you makes this game a dream. Would def reccomend to anyone who like overhead strategy games!"
Good game though it is more than 15 years old. Classic never dies.
"Sheeps can explore land for you, kings are faster than cavalry, idle villagers get slaughtered, one man at arms can set a building on fire by hitting it, animals respect buildings and move out of the way, 10 elephants fit on a transport but 11 archers dont, and so much more flawed logic. It's still the best ♥♥♥♥ing game ever made 11/10"
A great rework of an old classic. A few hiccups with frame rate issues but future patchs should fix this problem. The new AI adds more to the fights so it is no longer such a rush of units all the time.
"Age of Empires II (The Age of Kings) is by far, the best in the series of AOE games. In the past, I spent countless hours perfecting build strategies, most of which I have forgotten and am relearning. It's fun to revisit this game and be able to multi-player it again."
This is Best RTS game. I recomended.
"old but good,decent game overall "
14 14 14
"AoE2 HD is AoE2 with a few updates. It's AoE2. Shall I repeat that? When I first played the original, which is essentially the same, I rated the game a 10/10. With the new updates, the 'HD', and the few bugs it has at intial launch"
"The game has been tweaked from the original to make the interface much more user friendly, I like it. For example right click drag moves the screen ( however it is a disappointing that this does not work while a unit is selected)."
"Got in a game with a more experienced player, built a empire, built a army, lost the army, lost the empire. 16/14 Would lose again"
Warning: Use caution when playing with friends who love to spam.    10/10 would get swarmed by Teutonic Knights again.
"Played this a lot as a kid and really enjoyed it back then. I have the CD disc of AOE but I couldn't resist buying it off of steam. Although this game is decently old, I still consider it to be one of the best games I've ever played and it's a something you can always come back to no matter how many years have passed. Best part of the game is when you have an army of sports cars attack a castle by flapping its doors an infinite amount of times and it somehow miracuously catches on fire because science. Sounds legit right?"
Childhood in HD. Nothing more to say. :) GG. Only negative aspect is propably that it is lagging sometimes when you want to play with mates or in the internet.
Amazing old school RTS that still holds up very well up to this day  Pros: - The HD version is an overall improvement over the original. you can play widescreen on your tv screen. - Very deep and rewarding strategies. - Challenging missions.  Cons: - Too 'Zoomed out' which makes things a little bit confusing during large skirmishes. - Physics was not improved in HD version.  Highly recommended 9/10
It's Age of Empires II ya bams what more do you need to know
"I've been playing AOE1 and AOE2 since i was 5, i thought it was awesome then. NOW ITS IN HD W/ MULTIPLAYER!!! WELL DONE MICROSOFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Has shooting cars.   8/10
A great little strategy classic. I still have occasional fun playing co-op with a friend against PC opponents.
One of the best games ever made on pc
This is a great game over all recomend it to anyone.
"This game is extremely challenging, but it's so fun to play. I played for hours with my friends, even though the CAVALRY ♥♥♥♥ING MURDRED ME."
awesome classic to play!!!!
"This game is a classic and this new version makes it legendary! Its a great blend of history, strategy, and micro-managing. It has a bit of a learning curve to get through, but the tutorials and the single-player campaigns make it great for casual gaming. The new multiplayer provided by Steam makes this game that much better and easier to pplay with your buddies and opponents! I've loved this game since I was 5 and its still one of my faves!"
Berry bush picking simulator!
Old and very good game
One of the best RTS ever created - in HD. Yes please.
"1. Build some houses around towers (nearby gold piles).  2. Put some archers in the towers.  3. Control other gold resources on the map.  4. GG new AI, good try"
"i really liked this remake, but i got some lag"
An RTS I've played since my childhood :) even though I wasn't good back then. Still fun to this day
"Had a short 2v2 multiplayer last night, little bit of input lag but nothing too bad. For those of you that played the original, be careful with that population limit... a 500 pop limit vs Mongols and Teutons isn't going to end well. Come to think of it, the Huns would be even worse.  10/10 as good as I remembered."
"This game brings back so many memories of the hours spent playing the original back in high school. I was surprised, though, that all the hotkeys had changed and how many of the original hotkeys I was still attemtping to use. Doing a bit of Googling I came across the site  http://aokhotkeys.appspot.com/  where I was able to get all of the original hotkeys mapped. Now the game is just as I remember and it's absolutely great."
One of the best RTS ever created - in HD. Yes please.
"1. Build some houses around towers (nearby gold piles).  2. Put some archers in the towers.  3. Control other gold resources on the map.  4. GG new AI, good try"
Old and very good game
It's oldschool and easy to play ! 100/10
I recommend this game by its awesome graphics!! omg :O
Great game!! YOU should buy it NOW!
"This is my childhood memories all wrapped up in one bloody, carnage riddled game. The HD version is a great way to pay respects to the classics. Love It!"
Great game buy it. Classic game remastered making it exceptional. The nostalgic value I got from replaying this was amazing and the replay value of the game makes it a great bang for your buck. I definitely recommend checking the workshop for mods to change some of the textures back to the originals to give it the real feel of the original.
This game bring's back nostalgia!   A awesome game and a fun game to play!
"Having been addicted to this since its first days, it is really pleasing to see the return of AOEII in HD. The game holds onto its origins with all the original civiliztions and campaigns. Gameplay is the same. Unless you get 'The Forgeotten Campaigns', you might find this a little monotonous. The DLC/add on adds 4 signle player missions, which spice it up a little.   There are also 5 new civilizations added in The Forgotten, new gameplay options (I like the idea of increasing my population size to say 500 for a bit of fun), new units, new techs, etc. It definitely spices things a bit.  In addition to the above, I have been able to introduce the game to my children and they are loving it. A must if you had any joy playing the original game."
If you don't like this game you either have no childhood or are too young to know what good video games are.
"It is simply an HD remake of one of the all time classic real time strategy games. Much fun, 10/10."
"Aaah nostalgia , best stratergy game ever of its kind :D :D:D"
"A defining game in the real-time strategy genre, 'Age of Empires 2' is just as fun now as when it originally came out. AOE2 is great for skirmishes between the 18 different civilizations; something that later entries in the series are severely lacking."
"Age of Empires contains a perfect balancing of micro-management that's easy to learn and a fun challenge to master. It's a four resource game using Wood, Food, Stone, and Gold to build units and research technologies. Villager AI make resources easy to gather with automatic collection after building a resource collection site (ex. build a mine near gold/stone and they gather the nearby gold/stone without command) . Military is based on a 'Rock, Paper, Scissor' system and is explained very well by unit descriptions in game (ex. Pikeman &gt; Cavalry &gt; Swordsman &gt; Pikeman). There are many civilizations each with specialty units and technologies, unique civilization traits, and various access limitations to the primary tech tree. So different civilizations will have varied success to each player based on one's own play style (ex. Huns, which start with max population cap, are great for early game rushing but have difficulty late game against more advanced units since they have very limited tech)."
"Even to this day this game can keep me glued to my computer screen for hours on end, still as magically as it was the first time i played it all those years ago! the recent patch has done a lot to fix some of the annoying bugs and performance issues!"
"My nomination for the 'Test of Time Award' 2016.  Now, I'm not saying this game will get me hooked for hours on end anymore. But it's still stupidly good, even after all these years. Honestly, if you're into RTS with base-building elements, give this one a shot. You can't really be wrong trying this one out."
"A classic game that is still pretty fun to play, almost 18 years later.  Thats why gameplay is so important, right ?"
"After so many years since I last played this (still has the CD-ROM for the Gold Edition), it is good to play it again.  Perhaps the best RTS game in all history."
Age of Empires II is an testment of real time strategy game design.
greatest game of all time
This game always brings a good time.
"One of the best known classic Strat. games of all time. Was fun playing threw the Campaign again. And it also teaches history. John of Arc, El'Sid and alot more was very informative."
great game!
"It's the same game you remember from back in the day, optimized with Steam. There are some great hi-res texture and terrain mods in the workshop, as well as lots of cool taunts and some excellent tutorial videos for if you're looking to get into the multiplayer - which is hella competitive.   There's a reason people still play this game when it came out in the freakin' 90s. It's a load of fun, the multiplayer is simple and can be very cempetitive if you're into that. If you just want a retro throwback for your games library, get it on sale. If you're looking for a competitive, classic RTS experience - it's worth every penny."
better than before a game i grew up with i would recomend it to any rts player :)
"One of the most amazing games i've ever played, now back to my favorite list!"
"Great game, fun to play again"
Best game of my childhood.
Awesome game. Fun to play with a group of friends :)
"I recommend this ♥♥♥♥ as it is some good vintage hardcore stuff. You build a villiage full of buildings and NPC's while gathering resources to build until a magical kingdom to ♥♥♥♥ everyone and their dog over. As you progress in your game, you notice that you look like your winning against the other teams, it turns out they all ganged up together and bust in and literally ♥♥♥♥ your whole village up, making you look like you live in Euthopia. They'll leave your town center up just to give you a glimer of hope but they come again and finish your ♥♥♥ like stir fry. This game though gives you an addiction and next thing you know, your a homeless man playing AOE II while your whole family is at KFC eating a chicken breasts with a rich black man."
its a great rts one of my favorites
Brings back memories :) Great game!
One of the best RTS games of all time
"This game is simply amazing, can get fairly boring alone but if you play with some friends..."
'wololo' changing colors since 1997
"My childhood, remade and getting new expansions a decade on. Who'd have thought? Far too much of a classic to not win the Test of Time award, to be honest. Especially when there's improvements and additions being added, too!"
"Great RTS. Don't expect nowadays complexity - just simple base building, mining for resources and obliterating enemies. Many campaigns with different challenges. Game aged a little, but is still very enjoyable. Hell for achievement hunters though. DLCs required for 100%."
Its Age of Empires
"I've been a fan of this game since forever, so here it goes."
"Amazing strategy game. Easy to learn, hard to master.   Still not convinced? OK, then... WOLOLO   You're now convinced."
Awesome remake fun and easy to play
"As good as it ever was, and much better than trying to get the non-HD version running on a modern computer. The graphics in the HD version are true to the original... so don't expect new sprites. This should really be called 'Age of Empires II - Now patched to work with modern computers'"
"This game was the best when it first came out, it was what got me into online gaming in the first place, it was also what got me into RTS' and now its even better!!"
10/10 game if u don't include unstable servers with peer to peer connection.
One of the most epic games of all time!
Wololo
"Very good game. A classic. A great RTS to play with friends into the wee hours of the night.  Overall, I give this game a 9.0/10.0"
"Awesome game, gameplay not touched just a bit polished graphics...must have for AoE fans."
A memorable RTS. Its strategy and nostaligic feel is unlike any other game I have played in the RTS genre.
"It's a pretty fun game. I bought it because I was feeling nostalgic, and it was certainly worth it. The massive number of achievements that you can unlock means that a game never goes by where you dont get a pleasant surprise at the end. Steam is a great platform for playing multiplayer games on, in the old version it was almost too much effort to set up a multiplayer game.  I reccomend this game."
"One of the best video games I have ever played.   It is rewadring to get good and when you can finally win some epic battles. The game can be fast paced or slowed down for you. It requires practice. You have some options you can set to manage your games. You can practice offline against the comptuer before you go get creamed online. The game just 'feels' right about everything for an RTS, and has a very high 'fun' level to it.  I was playing this fifteen years ago when it came out on the first computer I ever bought for myself. Now I am playing it again and what a blast.   Classic."
"One of the best RTS games I've ever played, I definitly recommend it to people that are into RTS and history."
Great Game ! One of my childhood memorys
"Despite it opening up the Age of Empires franchise to new players and new servers, it's hard to believe that it isn't a money grab considering the low amount of 'new features'.  You should consider getting it on sale for half the price."
This game will make any fan fall back in love with the game. It also makes a great lan party game!
Fu**ing Tyler and his British Long Bows...
This game is just pure strategic overtime game that has you play and build up a community and create new items. This game is flawless and deserves a 10/10.
"Age of Empires II is one of the best Strategy games ever made. I played the original for years, less in recent years because the game does not run well on recent PC's. Now we have a HD version. It is pretty much the same game, with graphics that are somewhat improved. Not that much however, but it is enough. Two big positive points are the mod support thanks to steam workshop, and the now offical add-on The Forgotten. I do consider the price too high, I only recommend a buy during a sale. I bought it myself during a sale, having resisted buying it when it came out.  Overall i rate this remake with a 6,5 out of 10."
"A blast from the past? lol this is one of the few RTS games I can stomach, pretty much the game game but now with archivements for hours of entertainement."
"A fun single and multiplayer game. Good graphics and comes with Conquerors expansion, which includes a new campaign, hero units, new game modes, and five new civilizations. It lags out a little at times."
The same feeling of old AoE II TC but with a better multiplayer
Fun as hell (especially against your friends via multiplayer) and the integration of the Workshop is a nice addition.  Only caveat is the missing LAN mode.
Great game
"This is my childhood memories all wrapped up in one bloody, carnage riddled game. The HD version is a great way to pay respects to the classics. Love It!"
♥♥♥♥♥in'
"Still the finest RTS available; long single-player campaigns, deep strategy, and challenging levels keep this game fresh. First played at a LAN party long ago, and in 2014 enjoying the single player all over again. There are other great RTS games out there, including this game's sequel, Starcraft, Warcraft, C&amp;C, Moon Project, and others... but none come close to the total package of AoE2. On top of this, the Steam version allows you browse tons of mods, including many graphical enhancements, and easily add them to your game without using third party sites or figuring out where to put something.   If you enjoy tactical real time strategy; you simply aren't a gamer if you pass this up."
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with an HD remake filled to the brim with content. With eight campaigns, a robust multiplayer, Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price."
"A masterpiece. None of that turn-based ♥♥♥♥, its a fast paced, strategic fantasy/medieval simulator that tests your skills as a leader. Buy it right now, and buy the forgotten DLC."
"I have every one of these games, take my word for it they are loads of fun."
favorite game from the old-times.
Pretty awesome Game
byzantines milkshakes biting and more benjamin rathjens verzion of this review good game though.
"Age of Empires II is one of the best Strategy games ever made. I played the original for years, less in recent years because the game does not run well on recent PC's. Now we have a HD version. It is pretty much the same game, with graphics that are somewhat improved. Not that much however, but it is enough. Two big positive points are the mod support thanks to steam workshop, and the now offical add-on The Forgotten. I do consider the price too high, I only recommend a buy during a sale. I bought it myself during a sale, having resisted buying it when it came out.  Overall i rate this remake with a 6,5 out of 10."
I don't think anyone really knows how much I played this game back in the day. Its amazing and a must play for anyone that acutally loves strategy games.
always there as a awesome classic nothing negative to say wish there was a Age Of Empires 4!?!??!
death match only
"A very real 'blast from the past'. I remember playing AoE 2 as a kid and this new revival has brought back many fond memories. The new HD version, with the power of Steam, allows for excellent multiplayer (provided everyone connected has a decent computer). The game looks nice as well - but even nicer with a texture pack conveniently produced by many talented members of the community (Steam Workshop). When bought on sale, this game is a tremendously good deal but it's still a good value even at regular price."
"I grew up playing this game. Its still the game we played for hours , Built wonders , Then realize we're in conquest mode and raged. Personally? I rate this game 9/10 because i wish i wasnt on conquest mode XD ."
This game is good if ya likes real time stratergy
I am sure you have read many of the negative reviews. The 3.1 patch helped immensely in solving the of the bugs. At the point there is a plan for a 3.2 patch that will fix even more. At this point I would say this game is worth buying
New multiplayer system is ♥♥♥♥. Get it
This game is a classic. If you want some old school RTS action with slick steam multiplayer options then you should probably pick it up. If you want a more modern experience get starcraft or something.
"It's the same good ol' Age of Empires II that you've loved to play all these years. The fire does look better and the textures over all are welcomed. The sound... well, 'sounds' a bit crispier so being able to hear the wololo in all it's glory can't be anything but a plus. However it lacks options in the settings like changing the resolution to your will. But at least it has a better online functionality thanks to steam.   Overall, it's just tweakings here and there so I would say unless you want to play online with your friends or you find it on sale (like I did), it's not worth it. However, if you don't have the game already and want to finally jump in, the game is awesome and played for a decade for a reason. It's a very good version, just not exactly worth a new purchase if you have the old one.  "
Very fun strategy game. Very excited to play this with my steam friends. Love the medieval setting as opposed to AoEIII
"After having had this game for several months, I must say, the state of the game is hugely improved. Barely any game wrecking bugs in multiplayer, I haven't had a game lost due to people being dropped for weeks. The multiplayer is much smoother, the lag is nonexistent if you get a good match, if you don't, it's still playable.  Bottom line, it's really improved, the quality of the multiplayer has exceeded voobly. Voobly still has a more skilled player base, but HD is a blast and so convenient."
"A game that was originally released in 1999, and now has been re-released with updated graphics to help match modern-day monitors, Age of Empires II: HD Edition is hands down my top pick for a civilization development Real-Time Strategy game.  For those of you who don't know what Age of Empires II: HD Edition is, it is a civilization development Real-Time Strategy game involved around gathering resources and amassing an army. You get to choose from 18 different civilizations from throughout the Midieval Ages, ranging anywhere from the Byzantines to the Chinese, all with unique units and abilities, and advance your civilization to dominance through exploration, conquest, or building and holding a Wonder. You can play either against computers, or online against other players to prove who is the best tactical commander.  I've played this game in its original form at my cousin's house back when I was much younger, and it was actually the first Real-Time Strategy video game I was ever introduced to. A fantastic game that just doesn't get old, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Real-Time Strategy."
great classic plus works on anything lol
"Excellent game, definately worth buying if you're a fan of RTS games or the original game."
i like game is good money worth fun
"So many good memmories from this game... my freakin childhood! i used to play this game alot, and the magic is still there, the amazing gameplay is still there... now all is left to do is to buy it, SO GO AND BUY IT FFS!  9.5/10 (im not giving it 10/10, because c'mon, where the hell is the HD? it looks exactly the same)"
"This game is amazing! Ive played AOE2 since i was five religiously but when they came out with this i was stunned with how much better things looked. The fire looks better, water looks more clear, buildings look better, snow looks great. And if you get the expansion pack, it is about 10000x better. There are new civilizations to explore, more units, game styles, campaigns, and new buildings. It's truly a game worth getting especially for all you AOE fans. Now with the trading cards (which i foolishly sold) and the achievements, the game itself is more fun, challenging, and purposeful. I recommend 100%."
one of my favorite games of all time. if you like rts games get this game
Got army of sheep  11/10
"10/10, would let it plow me in the ♥♥♥♥ again."
Longbow ain't do ♥♥♥♥!
One of the greatest games ever made!!! Been playing this for decades. HD version is even better.
"This is exactly what it says on the tin, AoE2 and along with it comes all the good times had when I was young playing my mates MP mode."
One of my favorite games ever
"Countless hours have been spent playing AoE2 with both friends and family, and it's always tons of fun. The gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to learn, yet deep enough for dynamic gameplay that requires planning and adaptability, with many viable tactics and counter-tactics.  A timeless classic, and easily one of the best real-time strategy games I have ever played."
This is the best the series has to offer. It costs too much though.
"GREATER POINTS Being one of the first computer games I've ever been priviledged to play (its predecessor probably being the first), Age of Empires II, even after more than ten years, continues to amaze me. Whether you're raising vast armies to bring your civilization to victory (no doubt with the support of a population enhancement mod), or if you pride yourself on creating the most impenetrable city/fortress known to Medieval man, this game fully supports your input with multiple ways to play, varying maps and map-types, and a near-full arsenal of weapons at your kingly disposal. The 'Forgotten' expansion/DLC brings in even more variety with new civilizations (and hence, new unique units), larger map options, and additional campaigns to follow historically-based figures from their rise to (more often than not) fall. The HD edition itself, although, holds its own quite nicely when the expansion is unavailable.  POORER POINTS Being a ten-year-old game means it certainly shows its age (especially to someone new to the franchise) with 2-D frame-based figures on a mock 3-D map (which several mods on the workshop can significantly improve), outdated AI (which there are mods to replace and improve the AI, even on the workshop), and a slight lack of cultural accuracy (such as the fact that all military units and villagers look the same across all civilizations, form the Britons to the Japanese. No mods I know of currently fix this). No, it's not as militarily-geared as, say, the Total War series or as economically- or culturally-geared as the Civilization series. The HD Edition does little more than increase the default resolution, provide more company labels before the out-of-game menu shows, replace the old water tiles with 'moving' tiles that simulate waves and the reflection of sunlight that shines in the wrong direction with accordance to all of the building shadows (a mod in the workshop helps fix this), and make the software more compatible with up-to-date PCs.  SUMMARY Overall, this is a great starting game for someone not only interested in the Age of Empires franchise (whereas the first game has several lacking mechanics such as land-based trade, detailed troop formations, overpowered units such as the 'Centurions' with 'Priest' support often spammed by the AI, et cetera), but also for someone wanting to introduce themselves to the strategy genre. Even for someone experienced in both categories is Age of Empires II: HD Edition worth taking at the least a look at. Truthfully, I can say that of the three real-time strategies of Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires series (and sadly it doesn't look as if we'll get any more) this one easily takes the lead. Whether that's my nostalgia or the truth speaking, I'll let you find out yourself.  Thank you for your time."
"Some games are like brown gravy, other games like white gravy. Age of Empires 2 is like yellow chicken broth gravy."
"Awesome game, gameplay not touched just a bit polished graphics...must have for AoE fans."
"I am preparing for the almighty chinese take over; Cool RTS mechanics, Rad water, Hate the single player."
very good rts game
"I wouldn't call it HD. It's a high-res patch AoE II + Conq Expansion with LAN support removed and Mod support included. Not worth $20, but buy it when it's on Special!"
"The definitive version of one of the best strategy games ever made. Compatible with modern PCs, scalable to widescreen monitors, yet still maintaining the multiplayer and mod compatibility of the original AoE 2."
"Its a great fun game, though the dlc should just be free updates. Way to greedy, for a game this old. I still like this game though. So many things can be improved."
"Age of Empires was the first game i ever played on PC. If you like games about building communities and taking down other armies, then you will love this!!"
"One of best strategic games for multiplayer ever made, plain and simple. Recommended!"
"If you played this game years ago , it'll bring back memoris. Unfortunately it's still got every one of the bugs that you remember as well. When you have an 8 player game, someone always drops. When someone drops the game often glitches and won't continue. Also the players haven't changed either. People still quit as soon as they get attacked.   ~A  Ok changing r eview THe devs DID fix some of the bugs I havent gotten an out of sync in awhile So its getting a good review now :D THere are still problems with the player base but oh well thats all steam games THere's also AOE2lobbycom if you want a better lobby browser"
Good game brings back some good memories.
"  This game is by far the best RTS game of all time. Dispite it's release in 1999, this game has continued to stay alive due to its enless amount of stratagies and game modes. My only issue is that online will sometime have short 3 secound freezes every few minutes and will crawl to a drudge if you are playing with 7 other people and every one has a maxed out army. Overall 10/10 best RTS to exist."
"A classic, do I need to write more?  10/10,"
When I was a kid this was my all time favorite game. I brought me hours upon hours of fun. I couldn't believe how they brought this game back to life and even added a few new campaigns and civilizations. They really did an amazing job. It was alot of fun to play a timeless classic. This was by far microsofts best game in my opinion. The new campaigns weren't perfect but they were alot of fun. I def reccomend to play this game whether you've played it before years ago or for the first time.
"As a teenager, I sunk hours upon hours into the original AoE2 and the Conquerors expansion- it was one of those all-consuming, defining games. When I revisited it later, I was dismayed that it didn't run well under Windows 7.  This HD remake is perfect, it makes the game play on modern machines, has functioning online play with the power of the Steam community behind it, and is just generally a definitive way to paly this absolutely classic game. Highly, highly recommended."
"Played this when I was little, somehow learned to play this game using the hotkeys and made 'X amount of allies vs X amount of Enemies maps.'  Amazing Game, This game may be lacking in most aspects in comparison to todays standards but however still stands, (IMO) , as a timeless shining gem among RTS series.  -All aspects of the game stay true to the disc version. (Unit Pathing,Combat,Mechanics)  Added: -Online Multiplayer thats actually Decent! -DLC -Optimization (Graphics) -Workshop!  -Most cons can be directed toward the limitations of the game during its time. ie: Units getting stuck.. (that's all I could think of..)//   It's not as flashy as other games, but it has its own unique charm, Large Battles and sieges feel real, and require careful planning/execution. A game where you can easily fool around and experiment in if you'd like to! Example; Cavalry Only, Quote the Rohirrim,Die to spears. Historic accuracy everyone!  The Campaigns show some of the real important battles/events during the time period in which they took place. Some campaigns teach new players how things work while others challenge more experienced ones.   I wouldn't be discouraged by price as it usually goes on sale for 75%+ at every sale.  All in all this was a fun game to play as a kid and I still enjoy playing it. However as a final warning,  *This can be very time consuming.*"
Its ♥♥♥♥ing AoE. Nuff' Said
"Definitely one of the best real-time-strategy games ever made. This also includes of the age of empires games as well as the great Age of Mythology. Ever since this game came out and I got my hands on it I couldn't stop playing for the longest time, sometimes I would keep on playing for more than 3 hours! I'm so glad that this game was remade HD for the newer computers since the old one doesn't work well with the new technology. I definitely recommend this game if you want to have fun, kill time, and use your brain!"
This game is awesome
Great game i love it. Really brings back memories. AI is ALOT harder then the orginal game which in my opinion is a good thing since theirs more of a challenge now. not much big changes from the orginal game but you do notice alot of little differents that makes the game amazing. The use of multiplayer is great aswell if the AI get to easy for you give yourself a try agaisnt some other humans! that will really test your skills.  If your wondering if this game is worth it i say yes.
Too expensive for a remake of a 15 year old game. Great game nonetheless
awesome game buy it when you can
classics! classics in HD! classics in HD with online multiplayer!  What you want more?! Buy it now!!!  10/10
Such a great game. Reuniting me with my childhood
"Awesome game, bring back the old Age Of Empires feeling. Love it to the bone."
"This game was the best when it first came out, it was what got me into online gaming in the first place, it was also what got me into RTS' and now its even better!!"
:)
10/10 game if u don't include unstable servers with peer to peer connection.
"Aaah nostalgia , best stratergy game ever of its kind :D :D:D"
"A defining game in the real-time strategy genre, 'Age of Empires 2' is just as fun now as when it originally came out. AOE2 is great for skirmishes between the 18 different civilizations; something that later entries in the series are severely lacking."
"Age of Empires contains a perfect balancing of micro-management that's easy to learn and a fun challenge to master. It's a four resource game using Wood, Food, Stone, and Gold to build units and research technologies. Villager AI make resources easy to gather with automatic collection after building a resource collection site (ex. build a mine near gold/stone and they gather the nearby gold/stone without command) . Military is based on a 'Rock, Paper, Scissor' system and is explained very well by unit descriptions in game (ex. Pikeman &gt; Cavalry &gt; Swordsman &gt; Pikeman). There are many civilizations each with specialty units and technologies, unique civilization traits, and various access limitations to the primary tech tree. So different civilizations will have varied success to each player based on one's own play style (ex. Huns, which start with max population cap, are great for early game rushing but have difficulty late game against more advanced units since they have very limited tech)."
This Game newer gets old :)
It fixes the graphical bugs you may have encountered if you tried playing the standard disc version on a newer PC. It really is just the same game however and doesn't really look much better but it is nice to have better multiplayer servers. Also the forgotten expansion DLC is worth buying if you like the new civs however the new campaigns are garbage in my opinion.
"Nostalgia.. Still the same good game that it once were, now in HD. It really looks better and the higher resolution fits in perfectly. A must buy for anyone who loved the original game."
very well done. A lot less buggy than I had thought it would be. Played a 4 vs 4 with friends and it went splendidly.
if you liked the original I guarantee you'll like this with full steam integration (so you don't have to ♥♥♥♥ around with IP's and stuff) plus some new features like higher pop cap and stuff so if your an age fan get it you won't regret it
Best game of my childhood.
Awesome game. Fun to play with a group of friends :)
"Great game, I played it pretty much every day when I was younger. Just as good as I remember it being."
"A true classic of RTS. And I'm not even a RTS lover.   The thing that I love about Age II is the balance. It's advanced enough to be strategically challenging, and simple enough to understand fundamentally what needs to be done with only a playthrough or two.   Basically, building a village with a bunch of houses, then spam several villagers. Villagers collect food, wood, gold, and stone (typically in that order). Then spam buildings. Advance technology. Rinse and repeat. Build an Army/Navy and any defences you can muster. Attack as applicable.  All before the enemy beats you to it, racing against time.  Grab some buddies and crank up the difficulty. You will know stress. And you'll have fun doing it."
feed that nostalgia... in hd!!
Still the best strategy game out there!
this game is the one 
This game is good and I like it a lot.
"Age of Empires II is a classic and a must-buy for anyone into the RTS-genre. Even though the HD version has some perks, it makes it easier to play an online game, has no more silly water on W7&gt;, has fewer connection issues (mind I say fewer, not none, this will always remain a part of the game where you spend more time setting up a game than actually playing) and maps are directly downloadable via the workshop. I also recommend getting the extra DLC The Forgotten as it gives new civilizations and really adds something to the game. Creating my own maps never gets old as well as playing others. The time you will spent on this game will definitely be of good value.  I still give this game 9/10."
They did a very good job with this game. Always have been an AOE and AOM and RON fan. I just hope they redo rise of nations because that was a kick ♥♥♥ game as well.
Still the best! &lt;3
This is a great game to play either alone or with friends. It can get a bit tiring someimesplaying against the computer- it can either be too easy or too hard so I would recommend playing with friends!
No school like the old school!
"A classic, I remember playing this as a kid. Just as good now as it was then, definitely recommend."
absolute corker of a game
Fun classic game and a good way to spend a few hours.
"An abosolute classic. If you have never played this game before i would highly recommend buying it with a group of friends and learning the ropes together. At first look the graphics look very out dated, which should be expected, but once you overcome that obsticle it really is just a ton of fun and you will soon be engrossed in how addictive the gameplay is. 8.5/10"
It's Age of Empires II. Duh guys.
"Great game, fun to play again"
"Having been addicted to this since its first days, it is really pleasing to see the return of AOEII in HD. The game holds onto its origins with all the original civiliztions and campaigns. Gameplay is the same. Unless you get 'The Forgeotten Campaigns', you might find this a little monotonous. The DLC/add on adds 4 signle player missions, which spice it up a little.   There are also 5 new civilizations added in The Forgotten, new gameplay options (I like the idea of increasing my population size to say 500 for a bit of fun), new units, new techs, etc. It definitely spices things a bit.  In addition to the above, I have been able to introduce the game to my children and they are loving it. A must if you had any joy playing the original game."
If you don't like this game you either have no childhood or are too young to know what good video games are.
"It is simply an HD remake of one of the all time classic real time strategy games. Much fun, 10/10."
"I recommend this ♥♥♥♥ as it is some good vintage hardcore stuff. You build a villiage full of buildings and NPC's while gathering resources to build until a magical kingdom to ♥♥♥♥ everyone and their dog over. As you progress in your game, you notice that you look like your winning against the other teams, it turns out they all ganged up together and bust in and literally ♥♥♥♥ your whole village up, making you look like you live in Euthopia. They'll leave your town center up just to give you a glimer of hope but they come again and finish your ♥♥♥ like stir fry. This game though gives you an addiction and next thing you know, your a homeless man playing AOE II while your whole family is at KFC eating a chicken breasts with a rich black man."
"First of all, a little context bias: I grew up with this game. I suck at this game. I'm not an RTS guy.  That said - fantastic game. I've played all of the AoE games. This one rises above them all. The graphics are dated, but a lot of effort went into them, and it looks genuinely great despite. Gameplay is not only fun, but satisfying and challenging if played online or against a harder AI.   Campaign games can become ruthlessly difficult at least for a simpleton like I, but they're not really the main attraction of the game. The best strategic fun is found in the random map modes, both on and offline. I can't say for sure whether the gameplay is accessible enough for someone completely new to the series, but many years ago, I managed to get completely hooked on this game. Matches can be tense and tactical from start to finish, but they can also be very therepeutic on easier difficulties if that's your thing.  In conclusion. Instant classic. Best in series. Good game to get into strategy games. Good game to stay in strategy.  Mandatory WOLOLO. "
"Reasons to buy this game: - You can convert a trebuchet - Stone walls catch fire if you hit them with swords - 10 camels fit in a boat, 11 people don't - 1 sheep equals 100 steaks - 30 people can chop up a sheep simultaneously - You can walk on water, but only if it's a little green 11/11, would wololo again"
"Well This game deserves to be a 9/10. Why? Lets go over with the basics: Age of Empires II was at a score of 92% while the Conquerors expansion is about 88% in total reviews. This game includes the actual Ages of Kings as well as the Conquerors. The gameplay in fact is the same as having those two games (nothing new except for the 500 population cap, widescreen support, Steam Workshop, Steam servers and leaderboard). The water, fire, cliffs, trees and effects have changed in order to make the game more HD. Single player is still the same but for the multiplayer, it was fixed before (last time, the players were out of sync). Well, this game deserves a gold."
"I recommend this game because it's an absolute blast when you get some friends together, and you are able to command giant armies, create alliances, backstab people. If you are planning on purchasing this to play solo I wouldn't recommend it. The game is very dated and lacks a large enough community."
"Have only played the game for 2.6 hours but I already love it!  I recently purchased the game to play with a few friends at the price of $7.47. Little did I know the next day the game was on sale for $3.29... So I opened up a steam ticket in the morning before I made breakfast and before I was done eating the ticket had been approved even though I had played over 2 hours! Nice to see that the steam refund service works well.   Gameplay wise it's amazing, the game may seem old and outdated to those like me who have never played it before the HD version but to those who have played it before they say it is awesome. The amount of content and micro managing that needs to be done is enourmouse and always keeps you doing somthing. There are many different countries who you can play as and many differnt maps you can play on. Not to mention that there is steam workshop support which makes it so you can download custom maps and characters.  Although I haven't managed to play the game much so far I'm really enjoying what it has to offer and all the future fun I will have in solo and multiplayer with friends!  "
challenging but fun
"With new dedicated multiplayer, expanded resolution, built-in Twitch support, and ongoing support community, this game is a must-have for real-time strategy fans. One of the finest titles of the Age of Empires series has been given the support it needs to enhance the game for long-time fans, as well as introduce new players to the series. With most of the initial bumps smoothened, Hidden Path and Skybox have done a great job in bringing this game back for the modern gaming community.  The Forgotten Expansion is a must-have too. Incredible scenarios, new civs, and continuous support from the mod's development team has made The Forgotten one of the finest add-ons to any game I've played.  My only mark against it is the lack of functionality of its Workshop. While AoE2 HD has a diverse Workshop community, getting mods to appear in-game is a lot more difficult than it should be. Often, the 'subscribe' button doesn't seem to initiate a download, and many times mods simply aren't loaded. It's a shame, since this is pretty much the only major flaw in an otherwise great reboot."
"The greatest RTS game of all time returns in it's maximum glory. Not to mention a brand new expansion pack. A little buggy, and not much has really been done (developer-side) to upgrade it. But it's AoEII available in HD widescreen resolutions. Not much more to ask for."
Great game a little bit of lag when playing online but apart from that an allround great game! :D
I burnt down some green twots churches. 11/10
"More optimized than Age of Empires 3, 10/10"
I wish they didn't charge for the people who bought the CD version in the 90's but I guess the dlc could be worth it. Sadly I couldn't find anyone online to play a multiplayer but then again I am a little rusty on my RTS skills since the last time I played age of empires was in 2003. (original version non HD).  Because windows 10 no longer supports the non HD version I had to buy this but like I mentioned above the DLC with new civilizations and campaigns are worth it. I'd also like to mention I bought it during a discount phase at a reasonable price.  I hope I get the chance to play online but then again it's a fine single player game and the AI can provide a challenge if you are new to RTS games.  I'd recommend you wait for a discounted price before purchasing this title since it is a game developed in the late 90's and you could as well fine more modern RTS with a similar price tag.
All i can say is that you have to play this game it is so epic...  Everything is good if you do not know nothing about this game it is simple...  this game have campaign that you need to advance to finish the game and have a standard game...  storyline is good and epic. Standard game... You play against computer or other players and try to win the game.  this game you start with a building called by Town Center that you can generate people and start to building stuff...  you can build armies and put down the other teams to conquer the map!  amazing that is all i can tell!
Still one of the best RTS games out there.
Love playing this game with my friends. Despite being an old game it is one of the best ones I've ever played if you love real time strategy (RTS) games then this is the game for you. It is a bit pricey I must say but it is worth it.
"The fact that there is an official expansion to a game this old ought to give you an idea of what a timeless classic this truly is. While it may not have the bells and whistles of more recent RTS games, the balance, the mechanics, and the setting all make for one of the best RTS games ever made."
"During my freshman year of high school, my old history teacher made all of his classes play this game, and we would all play in the computer lab he rented out for us. He even made it work for LAN so each class would play against each other at their period.  It's that good.   "
"Was probably the at the Top of the RTS games in its time, now its back! Revamp!, Now HD more CIVS, New workshop for better customed games. ingame lobby and stream. so check it out and enjoy"
"Two words ; HD, WORKSHOP. Totally worth the buy plus now The Forgotten expension is out I could play this game for hours and never get tired, new computers AI in The Forgotten are better also, not talking about all that stuff/maps you can add at will. I RECOMMEND!"
"THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASSIC  -But the Steam release has no LAN, it's online only. Sorry but that's bullsh*t, I already own the original game. AOE2 was the biggest game for LAN back in the day."
Childhood Classic!
"Travis Warburton really needs to buy this god damn game I swear to good, you don't even need to look at reviews Twar what the faf. It's really good you can play as the Vikings"
This game brings back the memories of playing against my brother and dad all day long like a tournament! Love this game and glad it is HD now!
"I've played every installment in the AoE series, including Mythology. In my opinion, this game is the best in terms of gameplay. The fact that this is an HD re-release makes it even better. Play this game if you want an excellent RTS experience."
want some lag with that?
Old classic just remastered and brought back to life! Games from the early 2000's back in 2013! Pure sweetness!
Even better then the original!
It's Age of Empires II. Duh guys.
good game is totally awesome and very very fun..........
I played this probably the most out of any other game as a kid and this brings back memories.
It's fun and classic RTS game very of us knows :D...It's great in lan parties because it's easy to learn and hard to master !
One of the best Strategy games made. Weeks/Months of fun all in this one package.
i've been playing this game off and on since i was a wee lad and this game owns bones god damnit buy it now
"If you like the good old aoe II, you will definetly like this upgrade."
Great old school game
"good fun, ai still a pain though"
"An abosolute classic. If you have never played this game before i would highly recommend buying it with a group of friends and learning the ropes together. At first look the graphics look very out dated, which should be expected, but once you overcome that obsticle it really is just a ton of fun and you will soon be engrossed in how addictive the gameplay is. 8.5/10"
CLASSIC RTS
Definitly a classic and a must get for those who love RTS games.
"Excelent strategy game!  The graphics are better now, specially if you play using high resolution video settings; the game run smoothly*; the max population can, oficially, be way higher than used to be - now it's up to 500 units -; the multiplayer system is way better than used to be - now you can use the Steam to invite friends or you can look for a game using it's own game searcher -; you still can create your own maps/campaings and share with your friends and the whole game community.  *In the other hand, if you play with a really huge number of units, you may experience a significant level of lag."
REALLY fun game I recommend this to EVERYONE. Fun to play with FRIENDS ! 9.9/10
"Its an old game, theres not really much to know. Its an RTS with Melee, Range, Mounted and Siege. In general, they have their own strengths, with buffs based on which race you are playing. Thats in general, but in practice you'll find that Ranged units will just kite the hell out of EVERY single unit, even if its ranged. There are grand walls and castles you can build! But they get outranged by siege which they couldnt hurt anyway because of ridiculously high pierce armour.   If you like RTSs, this is one. Fun with Friends."
Overall just like the old game. Thumbs up. :)
For me it's one the best games ever. I love it.
Great strategy game to play with friends!
"A remake of a great classic - I've played Age of Empires II almost since it came out.  The new graphics and settings are very handy - you can now play with a population limit of up to 500.  The main reason I bought this game, though, is for the Steam Integration. With that, it is now easy to set up multiplayer games with friends all over the world."
"Considering that the orignal games graphics were clunky and bland, this game is defiantly a great visual remake of the old one and it also has the great mechanics of the oringal"
best game of the history
"One of the best strategy games. Good gameplay with great balance between economy and warfare. Recommended both to those who like building a large empire and those who like besieging an enemy one. It provides a large variety of units, game options and game types, including historical campaigns. Each civilization has its own pros and cons based on history, allowing you to develop many strategies considering the enemy forces and yours. With an easy to use map editor, where you can create and play your own scenario. Not outstanding but good graphics. Easy to learn the basics but requires practice to get used to it."
"Does anyone think that the 3rd one is better? Hopefully not, because this game is a perfect game to play on a rainy day. Here are my reasons:  1. It's simple to play. 2. It satisfys my craving for victory. 3. Wololo!  These reasons truly express my opinion on what this game has done to influence me."
"This game is 100% better than the original. It boasts a 500 unit max pop, adds 4 new civs with some interesting uniques (not that big of a deal since all units are pretty much the same except the 1 unique one) but also..  IT ♥♥♥♥ING HAS MULTIPLAYER AGAIN.  Ahem. Yes that is true you can play your own maps via Steam multiplayer and the graphics are much improved! Weird thing is I have run into some lag with playing with larger populations.. Not sure why, my computer is a monster. I could have bought like a few 2 month long relationships for the price of this beast! Anyway... I don't know why I get a stutter but it does happen.  Other than that, which doesn't happen on my friend's PC, I'd say its a perfect update to the old AoE, and there really isn't an RTS that can beat AoE 2, except maybe Company Of Heroes 1 (NOT 2!!! 2 is a ♥♥♥♥ing item mall scam and they developers should be burned alive.) Getting off track again.. Like I was saying (#2) It is great to have AoE2 back. It's a solid game from the old school library. There have been many repeats but only one stays true, AoE2. Rhyme not intended.  I say buy it, especially if on sale. It's a classic. Multiplayer works again. Graphics function and look great (For 2D diablo-esk graphics) are very well done. The water trips me out for some reason.  If you like this style of game and are not a prick about old school graphics, this is a great buy for a modern machine."
Good old game with new HD graphics.
"For those who don't know,  Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings  was released in 1999. After that the  Conquerors  expansion was released, which almost everyone who has the original Age of Empires II also got. The game is one of the most popular RTS games in existence. It's most fun when played in multiplayer, my friends at college and I love playing multiplayers games all crowded together in one dorm room. Trouble is, we can't play over the summer because the online support for it was dropped years ago (it is an old game). A lot of us were disappointed by this fact, and Microsoft must've found out, because they modified the game to work with Steam's multiplayer system and re-released.   What's new and improved in the Steam version of the game:  -Slightly updated graphics; almost everything looks exactly the same or identical to the old version, except for the water, which looks a lot better in the new version; the old game looked good (2D graphics), so no change is good here (but the new water is nice) -New resolutions are supported, along with dual monitors (the old game only supported 1280x1024, 1024x768, and 800x600) -There is a new AI, thanks to a recent game update (recent as of 6/29/14) -The max population cap was move from 200 to 500, you can still limit it to all the old settings if you want -All multiplayer works through Steam now   What is not so good in the Steam version  -The game requires a much better computer to play than the old one; this is actually very obnoxious, the graphics really are not much improved (except the water, of course), but it takes a lot more graphics muscle (yes, not just CPU) to play it smoothly -Multiplayer is rather laggy, almost every game I've played has had a very unpleasant amount of lag; for this reason, if you are not a big fan of the game, you should not get it unless you want to play the campaigns and single player battles (which are still fun); I still play multiplayer almost exclusively, but I really like this game, so that's why -LAN multiplayer isn't an option now; I would hope that it still uses only the LAN when all players are on the local network, but I don't know; however, while I say this is a bad thing, it hasn't actually caused a problem for me  Apart from what I mentioned above, the game is pretty much exactly like the old game. You can play it with no change in gameplay if you like, by setting the pop cap to 200 or less, and you can even choose to play agains the old AI. The game plays like the 1.0c update of the original  Age of Empires II: The Conquerors . Oh, and if you haven't figured it out already,  Age of Empires II HD  includes all the features of  The Conquerors  expansion."
"Put AI on harderst difficulty. When I moved to invade, they had walls made out of castles. 10/10.  But seriously: Pros + good balance + feels good to hoard resources + can multi with friends + most satisfying game I know of for crushing opposed empires with obscene amounts of troops  Cons - muh grafx (don't really need them, but they aren't that good) - I swear the AI cheats"
Such a great game. Reuniting me with my childhood
"Awesome game, bring back the old Age Of Empires feeling. Love it to the bone."
I just beet fr0nt1er in a 1v1 10/10 would play again.
"A gameplay review of AoE 2 HD is simple: it's just AoE 2 with a coat of paint. You buy it if you want to play AoE 2 again. That's not what I want to talk about.  I want to talk about the achievements. When I bought this I thought, 'This'll be like Civilization 5! I'll have some neat achievements that'll give me something to aim for during classic RTS gameplay.'  I should have looked. Why didn't I look?!  Every achievement goes something like this: Win the single player game 10/100/1000 times. Win the multiplayer game 10/100/1000 times. Win as INSERT_NATION_HERE 1/10/100 times. Beat the game so many times you ascend mere playerdom and  become one with the software .  The worst part? I wanna do it. I wanna see all those green bars fill. I want to attain nirvana. WOLOLO.  How much AoE do they expect me to play?"
So much easier to play multi now that it is on Steam!
"Classic game, now in HD... I do recommend this HD remake but only if its on sale... Does have some frame rate issues but for the most part its worth it :)"
Amazing game. I have loved AoE since the begining and this one deffinatly lives up to expectations. The game its self is pretty much the exact same as before now with much better graphics.
"Awesome and timeless game, you would be crazy to skip this if you love the old school RTS with base building and such a variaty of units."
This is a great game over all recomend it to anyone.
"This game is extremely challenging, but it's so fun to play. I played for hours with my friends, even though the CAVALRY ♥♥♥♥ING MURDRED ME."
"Game I played when I was like 7 and recently decided to buy this on steam, and I can say I was not dissapointed, the game is exactly how I remember it although, in the HD version the colors are a bit better but if I had the choice I would just buy the normal AOE 2- but! As this is the only AOE 2 on steam how could I argue. The game controls I can really say as I learnt to use them ages ago and can use them off memory, but I guess are easy to use since if a 7 year old me could use it, it couldn't have been too hard. The grapics are meh for something but for something that came out that far ago I can give it points. I would say that the AI in this game are op as f*** I had it on normal and I strrugled to keep my town from being destroyed although playing online with real people is even harder as most people are really good but playing tis with a friend and teaming up is probably the most fun I have had in ages. This is the type of game you don't really have to put too much effort into for me is a game you can just relax on and its even better playing with friends. Yes I would recommend it but I don't think its worth the price. I would wait for it to drop to about £7-£8"
"If you've ever been a fan of the Original then you'll love the HD version. Fantastic gameplay, multiplayer, and integrated Twitch streaming all make this classic truly great."
Why the f*** not? 
Played this for hours back in the days Great game!
This game is Amazing! I use to play it as a kid back in the day and when I saw steam had it it was a no brainer to buy it!
"Used to play this when I was 5 years old or so. After more than 12 years it still offers great RTS experience and nostalgia, although the HD version could have been much better: the game is virtually untouched, save the resolution and steam integration. Still, at -75% it is quite reasonably priced and yes, I recommend it."
Spawned in. Couldn't remember how to do anything. Enemys at imperial age while im at dark. get ♥♥♥♥♥ with arrows 10 minutes in. 10/10
"Incredible throwback to a forgotten age of videogaming with some minor tweaks, texture updates, and massive commmunity support. Love this game."
"I used to play this game all the time on with my Gold Edition set and always had a lot of fun. Although AOE 2 HD looks largely the same (to me at least), it's worth the price on here mainly for the Steam integration. Now there's no reason to download a third party client or run a cable through the length of your house if you want to play with another person. Finding mods and maps is now a lot easier as well. Plus there's a new expansion. It didn't bother me at all to buy this game again even though my discs are still in working order."
One of the best games ever made!
"Despite how bad of a Metascore this got, great game. Great game indeed. The new textures are nice, and its so much easier to play with your friends now, with the old website being down and all. Good job, developers; go get yourselves a cold beer and pat yourselves on the back. You deserve it."
With steam it takes this game to the level it aways should have been. Age of Empires 2 was aways great because of the diverse selection it brought and now with the steam community it's super easy to play with friends and other players acrossed the globe.
Very fun game to play unfortunately crashes are prety common and the game still needs alot of work.
I love RTS (real time strategy) games so this is perfect for me. I had it as a kid and I have it now and I still LOVE it! You should get it right now!
A wonderfull remake of the epic AoE 2 with better grafics and effects.  You can also have more units now (500) and there is a new map size (epic) which makes it even more fun to play.  Also a big + for the Multiplayer support via steam. You can totally easy invite your friends and have epic fights together against bots or against each other.  Totally worth its money.
"If you played the original release (1999) of this game, you're going to love this!  An average game sets you off in the Dark Age, and you progress further to the Feudal Age by building 2 structures (buildings) from the Dark Age. The way I recommend to start a game off is by getting those extra villagers to stockpile on food and wood. Stone and Gold can wait until the Feudal Age. As you progress further in your match, you will be able to research new technologies and gain a grip of your troops that your enemy may not have. You will also go through the Castle Age and the Imperial Age. The Castle Age is based on the late middle ages, and the Imperial Age of based on the Renaissance. The fun starts at the Imperial Age when you can start using cannons and bombard towers, as well as trebuchets.  Victory can be attained through a variety of options, depending on the game mode and the conditions set by the host. The most common is winning by building a wonder, by conquering and pillaging your enemy until he's all out of forces and resources, or by capturing and holding all the relics on the map. In game modes such as King of The Hill, you win capturing and defending a wonder for 500 years (in-game years). Each game mode will set different conditions for all the players.  The only thing that gets my jimmies rustled about the AI is the constant begging of either wood or food, and if there were achievements for contibuting to an allied AI's silence, I'd have it by now. 'Wood please, food please', makes me wish I didn't lock those teams. I feel like this is a glitch, since my ally keeps asking for more wood even though I just contributed 3000 wood to him. Wood doesn't grow on trees, oh wait, it does.  I like it how you can easily just join/host a multiplayer lobby without needing to portforward or use a 3rd party client. This was my biggest issue with the 1999 release, and it's good to see that it has been fixed. The game still has the lag issue that happens when you get a variety in ping on multiplayer matches, but it has been better compensated for this release.  If you play with a population limit of 400 or 500 with a mediocre computer, and you're playing on a large map with a decent amount of players (6+), the game may tend to freeze. My specs are twice as better as what's recommended and it happens to me a lot. This is really inconvenient and handicaps my performance in the game.  What I pay a lot of attention to is how the game can now cover your whole screen so you won't get those black borders when running the old version in compatibility mode. Of course I know that this release supports my resolution (1366x768), or else we wouldn't have a reason to call this the HD edition.  The multiplayer experience is still tense and full of unexpected plots. The average match lasts for about 2-3 hours on large maps with 6 players, but those are the hours you won't regret spending. Larger maps with the max limit of players (8) can last for 4-6 hours. I've never endured a match that's longer than 6 hours in the 1999 release. With the new map size in this game, I can predict that a match with the max amount of players and the biggest map scale can last up to 8 hours. That's more than 25% of your day.   I give it a 95/100, it's definitely a player's choice in the RTS genre."
"very fun game, takes me back."
"It's AoE2. Y'know. That game you grew up with, letting you impress your teacher s with your impeccable knowledge of history. Everything's been upscaled and a few minor adjustments have been made. Other than that... It's AoE2. In HD."
"fkn dope, people online r pro tho."
Reviewing Age of Empires II HD I Recommend this game my Friends come join me in battle :yay:
I loved to play the Non-HD verson of this back in 2009 and still love the game 10/10
OLD SCHOOL ♥♥♥♥. THIS GAME IS AWESOME
This is such a wonderful game. Brings back such memories and will help create many more. I love this series.
"Usually when you play graphically upgraded games from your childhood they suck noodles, but this is exceptionally good"
Two words 'The best'
"I lost my old AoE 2 CD, so many memories."
Many reccommend.
Teutonic Knights: How in the world do you run so hast in those cloaks? 11/10
"Not a big improvement over the standard AOC, but add in the forgotten's expansion, currently active development, unified multiplayer lobby and the upcoming African Kingdoms expansion and you get a solid purchase."
One of the best games ever made. Nuff said.
"So gut, best childhood ever!"
@@
Old but Gold
"Age of empires 2 HD.. Nothing bad to say. Graphics are great. The strategy elements are awesome! And it's difficult in its own special way. I highly recommend this game if you're new to strategy games. It's by far the best to get into and it's really fun and easy to understand. There are a few bad things ofcourse like:  Not being able to select all your soldiers at once. Soldiers not listen to you and go on their own way.  But for the rest, great game.  This game gets a 9/10  Great game!"
"best RTS on the market even though it is 10+ years old every game is unique &amp; challenging, online experiance is awesome &amp; elo scoring system means that every skill level can play."
Its a great game
Hands down one of the best games ever made. Still enjoyable to this day.
Pure perfection
"I spent far too much hours on this game.This is the remake I was hoping for. Except for some lag when playing multiplayer with a lot of units, I'm not able to say something negative."
"A classic, indeed. I never get bored with Age of Empires II. Each scenerio is unqiue to the last, and you never know what to expect with the re-programmed AI. Lots of memories fall from this game from when I was younger, and I can proudly say it hasn't lost it's zing."
"This was a game I loved as a kid. I don't feel I can give a fair review without disclosing the nostalgia glasses I will be looking through. For me, this is still one of the best RTS games. The game doesn't feature real-time 3D, but then again the pixel art is so detailed that it feels right. This is even more true now that they updated the graphics and added modding support."
Awesome game From my child hood. Love this full stop.  10/10 graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 workshop content
Worth a buy!
Good gameplay and graphics which let you feel nostalgic :).
Childhood memories.
fun but all your friends will roast you if you ask them to buy the game and play with you
The game of my childhood.  Still an active community so go ahead and buy it.
"Enjoyable with a small slice of 'History', and multiplayer is enjoyable."
"The HD version is cheap and fun, the original AI a little bit buggy and predictible. It's way better to play this game online with some friends.   The price is way damn cheap, I spend less than 3 bucks for this game  WO LO LO!! WO LO LO !!!! WO LO LO!!! 10/10"
"I love age. But only get this when its on special not worth the $20, as nothing has really changed from the original not even matchmaking(shoulda modernised it a bit) has been made better as i thought it would of been as its on steam. If it was always $5 I woulda got the game much earlier. And the forgotten DLC should of been much cheaper as its free outside of steam. But achievements so thats nice."
"The timeless classic is better than ever. Plus, the publishers are now working on another DLC. What could be better."
One of the most epic games of all time!
"Age of Empires II (The Age of Kings) is by far, the best in the series of AOE games. In the past, I spent countless hours perfecting build strategies, most of which I have forgotten and am relearning. It's fun to revisit this game and be able to multi-player it again."
This is Best RTS game. I recomended.
"Had a short 2v2 multiplayer last night, little bit of input lag but nothing too bad. For those of you that played the original, be careful with that population limit... a 500 pop limit vs Mongols and Teutons isn't going to end well. Come to think of it, the Huns would be even worse.  10/10 as good as I remembered."
"Ridiculously fun to play with friends, persians OP as hell."
Amazing game which takes me back to when it just came out. Compared to other strategy games atm AoE II still takes the crown. It's recently updated so it's definitely worth checking out!
How do you turn this on?
"Totally awesome game, would recommend it to everybody!"
♥♥♥♥ you Edshot
A classic!!
Its got cool boats and cool catapults
You can create suicide bombers and destroy entire enemy bases.   20/10 Would Snackbar with Allah again.
"Awesome ♥♥♥♥ing game. Though, you should install a HD texture pack from the Workshop."
"As a fan of Age of Empires and the second one in particular for multiple years now, I had to get this game. I almost literally wept when I saw how beautiful this game looked in HD. However, there are some bugs in this remake that were not present in the original game. Sometimes the AI can be rather stupid and seige weapons (trebuchets in particular) will sometimes ignore orders to attack certain buildings. I'm sure these bugs will be patched out of the game as time passes, but it is still rather annoying. But this game was worth every cent I paid for it. If you are a fan of Age of Empires, you have to get this game."
"10 years later, and I still suck at it.  Would definitely recommend."
i didn't even like RTS games until i played this game and it's just so good omfg buy it
"Hi! First let me say, i love strategy games like this one. And i always like this kind of games. Like this one, the AOE 2 HD. It`s the sequel, and in HD?! I know, it`s the same, but with more detail graphics. So what, it`s the same, it`s original, and i have to say, it`s one of the best Strategy Classic &amp; Medieval games i ever played. This game like any other game, have his problems/mistakes, but in other way, it`s so cool with this saga that continues, and you can do what ever you wanted, cause have the creative mode and all that, have multiplayer, SP, you want trading cards for this game? Have it to, you want more? This game have also a DLC, that contains more civilizations, new game modes and etc. Conclusion, It`s a great game for real. And if you want more and liked this one.. What you waiting for? They have the next Age of Empires, the next sequel, Age of Empires 3! ;) So i recommend for shure this game! Have Fun!"
This game is game of my life.I think i will never stop playing AoE II.Since microsoft studios is back I hope that one day they decide to make fourth game.
"Without doubt, the best strategy game out there that has stood the test of time for years and will continue to do so. Still updated now and again and still has quite the large community. Never short of joining lobbys and never short of fun and interesting match ups.  11/10 will play for over 600 hours again.  Wololo."
"A classic one, no doubt all shall own it! (good for teaming up and fighting!)"
Legendary game that always has a place in my heart. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
"Massive nostalgic value if you are like me and played this back in the early 2000's, really great game and suprisingly has a strong online community with Steam and Voobly! Definitely worth picking up and even goes on sale for as low as 3-4€ every now and then"
One of the best If not the best game I have ever played. lots of fun for 15 more years :)
"Simply, this game is AOE 2 with some nicer textures, 1080p support and minimal AI improvements. If you don't have AOE 2, buy this game when it's on sale or something. It's not really worth the default price, but it's still a fun game."
"I picked this up because there was a pricing error for the complete edition on amazon during a sale a couple years ago and finally got around to playing it, so by no means am I a die hard fan of the series.   From a campaign standpoint, the learning curve is more of an angle. It's quite difficult to hold your own in the campaign on the easiest difficulty even if you are new to it. I would have put more time into it if I had been more interested in the content, but it just made me butthurt. However, this level of difficulty was later corrected in III and Mythologies.   Aside from that, the game is remarkable in terms of content, relplayability through online multiplayer, and a nearly perfect relationship between developers and community. If anything, this over a decade old game has amassed an amazing following who provide a great deal of Workshop content (which I would familiarize myself with before pressing Play, as some mods fix graphical issues). The fact that they just released DLC a month ago proves my point.   If RTS' are your main squeeze, buy this on sale or not. You will log hundereds of hours into this."
Amazingly addictive its alot of fun.
"The Age Of fanchise is an amazing set of games, and Age of Empires 2 is no exception. It's a game of stratagy, diplomacy, and thought that will entertain you for hours and hour on end. For the nostalgic feelings, and amazing gameplay for it's time and now, I would definatly say this game is worth getting."
Nostalgia overload. So good.
every time i hear a sound or an npc saying something i can see me when i whas 10 years old and playing this game.  nostalgia is awesome ! !
After all these years still a great game
"Great game, a glance to the past :)"
"One of the best classic RTS's that I've ever seen. Good economy system, large scale battles. Lots of playable civilizations too."
"This game is a classic RTS. The fact that people still play this game is a living proof that the RTS genre has some niche for the slower-paced RTS type of AoE II. We players hope that a new release, with present-day technology and online competitive play in mind, will aim to cover this niche. Until that day comes, we have this wonderful game: Age of Empires II."
my childhood game and one of the best games ive ever played! Its a great stratagy game i highly reccemend this classic game. (really fun)
"Classic game, i'm having a lot of fun playing it even if i suck so hard. And i'm glad they are still trying to improve it. You guys should purchase it without any thoughts. Also, one of the best soundtracks i've heard in a game. That epic music is a solid 10/10 for this game"
"Fun to play, hard to master."
"My old game, since i was 13yo. This game is really awesome! i love the contents and the civilizations! So many details added and some new civilizations added. More like it!"
This is just an epic game that i have been playing wiht the whole family for over a decade now and it hasnt got old yet! This is just one of those games that will always be on the list of multiplayer games that you mjust have to play. Once you start playing with friends i guarentee it wont be the last!... Cheers everyone and enjoy! We sure have! 
"This game is a true strategy game, and possibly the best game ever made."
Its a classic.
"This game brings back so many good memories for me. While I didn't play this back in the day, I played Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, which I think, runs on the same engine (Genie Engine). They have a huge selection of factions and campagins. even though this game is pretty old, it's feels funner than some newer games.  Long story short, if you like SWGBG, get this."
best game ever everyone buy this ♥♥♥♥ 
"Brings back old feels of my childhood, even if you didnt play this a wee laddie it will still give you some good feels and fun!"
"Still a very fun game, the graphics still look nice."
"As it first came out a fantastic game, but now with HD and a population count of 500 :D"
It was the my first game. And im still love this ♥♥♥♥in game. I was saw steam sale and bought this game thx valve :')
"Been playing this game since I was eight years old. Eight years later, I still play it. Buy it, it is probably the best real time strategy game of all time. 11/10"
"I picked this up when it was on special, just waiting for it to go on sale again so my friends pick it up.  Classic game , Awesome times."
"This game is addictive, no matter how old it is, it can still keep you coming back to play :) it's one of my all time favourites"
Throw back and just as good! Love this game.
Played this as a kid. To this day it is still amazing.
Very good game !
this game is incredible one of very few that is still very fun even if it is so old.  been playing since i was a little kid love this game  10/10
BACK TO BASICS :)
A classic. Grew up playing this.
This is one of my all time favorite games. So many things to do in this game... and destroy. Great campaign(s) too.
Great update to the game. Brings back all the old elements with a new look
Aztec A.I. builds only monks and converts everything you hold dear.  I love AOE2
"Even better than i remember it, this is prabably due to them still releasing patches 15 YEARS after releasing it."

"This game was good but not great. Although, that was probably because I had bought They Breathe before this. They Breathe is the best game since canned bread and for all you guys who like horror games out there, it is for you. I cannot list a single negative attribute to this amazing action adventure drama trilogy game. As you battle your way through moose slug creatures underwater, while rescuing your turtle brethren, your mind will forever be in that lake. The intense realism also adds to the dramtic effect of the flawless stroyline, which I have yet to make sense of. But, yeah, anyhow Age of Empires is okay, I guess."
"The first game I fell in love with, and it will stay with me untill the end."
YES! I recommend this game to anyone who wants to have some fun with some good old RTS!
"This game is immortal.  I remember this game came out when I was a kid and I would watch my father play. Now nearly 15 years later, it's still going strong with a great community. This game keeps gaining more followers thanks to steam making the multiplayer much easier to get into.  The gameplay is excellent, there are probably 2 dozen or so factions and all play very uniquely. Each faction has clear strengths and bonuses that you can take advantage of to gain an edge over your opponents. There are also team bonuses for each faction so your allies can gain certain military and economy boosts just for picking a certain faction.  There is a pretty clear rock paper scissors aspect to the combat. Cavalry are good against archers, archers are good against infantry, and spearmen(infantry) are good against cavalry. This is not always the case though. Some infantry units actually are very resistant to archers such as the Huscarl, Some archers get a bonus versus cavalry (geonose crossbow). You have to be very smart about what kind of army build to bring against your opponents. Almost always you will use a combination of 3-4 different units to cover all weaknesses. Additionally, you will likely change your army composition as the games progresses to better counter your opponent who is also adapting. This makes for very great gameplay that never gets old.  The graphics are aged by most standards, but are timeless for us veterans. There are a variety of different cultures each with their own building designs. There are also so many different randomly generated maps and specialty maps where you are always having to scout around to see what resources are available. Due to the nature of this being a strategy game, the graphics are actually pretty good I think.  On a standard game you will find yourself in the Dark Age with a lone town center, 3 villagers, and a scout. As you gather the 4 resources: food, wood, gold, and stone you can research many different technologies and even adavance into the Feudal, Castle, and Imperial Ages. Different units, buildings, and technologies will be unlocked as you progress through the ages including giant mighty castles that train faction unique units. By the end of the game you have likely constructed around 100 buildings with hundreds of villagers and soldiers working their hardest to defeat your enemies.  This is a must have for all strategy game enthusiasts. People will still be playing this game in a decade for sure. It is timeless and addicting."
"Really fun game, my friend introduced it to me a couple years ago. I had it on the disc so I'm just now buying it on steam.  10/10 would buy again for $3.99.  "
"The HD version is cheap and fun, the original AI a little bit buggy and predictible. It's way better to play this game online with some friends.   The price is way damn cheap, I spend less than 3 bucks for this game  WO LO LO!! WO LO LO !!!! WO LO LO!!! 10/10"
its a top game mate
"sweet sweet memories, bring back Galatic Battlegrounds"
it´s one of the best games of all time also it helps you with history subject
"For me, this game was my childhood, and alongside StarCraft these two are my all-time favourites. Unlike StarCraft, however, I've mostly ignored AoE2's campaign mode but played copious amounts of its multiplayer (only agianst AI). AoE 2 is one of those games where choosing your difficulty really changes the feel of the game. Do you like building your little town and building up one big army of your best? Stick to the original AI. Do you want to feel like death at ending legions is around every corner? Select the new AI and prepare to regeret it.  AoE2 is very much a material-gather game, as a lot of RTSs are, but instead of Minerals and Vespene Gas you'll be hunting down Food, Wood, Gold and Stone as you push through the ages from wooden shacks to stone castles. There's a delicate balance between making enough Villagers for resource income, saving up enough for the next Age, and making sure you can defend your town from attackers. Games typically take me two hours, but I usually take my time and have 5+ AI in teams of two.  What can I possibly say that will make you want to buy this? Well, the art is beautiful and detailed for its time, and the HD updates only improve on this. There are a multitude of tactical options for you to take, be it via Seige, Melee, Ranged or even Sea. Building your little towns and walls is as much fun as the fighting, if not more depending on your play-style. In my option this is the most well-rounded Medieval-based RTS available, with SO many races for you to choose from, each with their own little quirks, art and unique units, I really would recommend it to everyone interested in the genre!  (My gameplay time here doesn't reflect how much I've played the original CD copy)"
"For me this game was a repurchase, as i already owned AoEII when it was 1st released.  Why buy it on steam? it's a time saver, now i don't have to search the internet for patches and mods anymore to make it run on windows 7 and up. The graphics have only been improved to look good at higher resolutions then the initial 1024 by 768 for which it was released. The steam workshop plug in breathes new life into the game when you get bored with the basic version and add-on. You are always up to date for a multiplayer game, so you no longer have to worry about incompatibility between versions. The only thing i haven't been able to test is multiplayer with mods, it used to work fine if all parties had the same mods, but i haven't encountered them yet as i prefer to play single player games (i don't like to quit mid multiplayer game)  For those have never played it, if you love RTS games and history, do not hessitate to purchase this game, especialy when its below €10,--  The only game ever to realy compete with AoE was Empire Earth 1 + 2, which i hope steam will also add to their assortment of games in the future."
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with an HD remake filled to the brim with content. With eight campaigns, a robust multiplayer, Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price of admission."
"Everytime I click on something, a villager says 'Toaster Strudel'. Who did this?  10/10"
If youve ever played the age of empires series before 3 than this game is the best of all of them. It's definately worth getting and in my opinion is the best strategy game released.
Wololo
I expected more civilizations in the release of age2 hd but the 'Forgotten expansion' solves the problem.  Making campaigns is difficult but worth it when you can show it to your friends.  I also think that it was a bad idea to not allow total conversion mods on the steam workshop.  It still has the charm of age of empires and the great campaigns.  Skirmishing and multiplayer remains challenging and fun.  Overall age2 hd is one of my favourite games I hope you like it and enjoy playing it.
"I used to play the original age of empires 2 back in the day, and spent quite alot of time on it. It is nice to see an hd remake of this old classic game. One of the best rts I have ever played, would recommend to any rts fan."
"The best and the most fun strategy game I have ever played. I have never met any technical issues, and with the steam workshop you can download mods and maps which makes the game even better! The broken AI from the original is finnaly fixed, the hardest difficulty now is fairly impossible to get beaten. The AI is really smart (IT has its bugs-bads tho). Anyways, it is the best strategy game I have played, I prefer it from Rise of Nations and I recommend to give the 20 Eu to buy it right now."
"This game is fun, especially when playing with a friend... also cant wait for age of mythology"
this game is one of the funiest strategy i ever played
A classic that been resurrected! One of my all-time favourite strategy games - the pioneering game that got me hooked into the genre. Never gets dull. Recommend it if you've been a fan and are looking for some nostalgia :)
REally enjoyed going back in time to play this. Certainly worth a pick up if at a decent discount
"A faithful remake of the original, AoE II HD is a must-play for anyone who has any interest whatsoever in RTS games. The AI has been beefed up so that, instead of just getting 3x/5x the resources you do from each gathering instance at higher difficutlies, they also can micro their monks, build counters, and intelligently design their bases for the most part. A++"
"Awesome instalment of Strategy, my childhood was spent in AOE and AOE2 is just as awesome!"
Still a fun game to play after all these years!! having fun playing with my family!
"What can I say- Roggan? Wololo? Shall I blame my ISP? Ahh memories.   I first played Age of Empires 2 when my brother showed me the demo for the conqueror's expansion pack, and since then I've been hooked by this game for God knows how long, I guess since I was in second grade- like 2002. Anyways, he didn't get Age of Kings until I got a chance to play Age of Empires 1, and damn, even though it wasn't the second I still loved it.   When Age of Empires 2 HD Edition first came to steam I was like 'HELL YES! I'm getting this.' However, I was a little disapointed, because of the lack of HD but it was still worth getting; thus, my childhood memories came back to me, and with the Forgotten Empires now an official AO2 expansion pack( would have been nice if they added cutscenes) I now have the chance to relive childhood memories with the sense that this is a completly different experience from what I encountered back in the winter of 2002.   I can also thank A02 for getting me into PC Gaming; back then, I was a console peasent, and I know that there was great games for consoles back than like Goldeneye 64( which gets an excetion for being an awesome game), but still Consoles lacked the manpower which was built in PC's. And AO2, I can thank this game for converting me from the Yellow Consoles to the Blue PC's."
It's the legendary strategy game! MUST HAVE!
What can i say this is the game i grew up playing most of all with my little bro. and my friends no matter how old this game gets it will allways be the ultimate  rts game and will allways be fun.  10/10
Great game!
"Class A RTS. Buy and play now. Eh, farms and doesnt afraid of anything."
"This was one of the first games I played as a kid, and getting it on steam was better than I expected. The water is cleared up in great quality, the campaigns are everything I expected and more, and the multiplayer is really fun! Be careful if you are playing against a moderate or higher level AI with a 500 population limit. They will take over half the map in 20 minutes and have a crap ton of soilders to throw at you."
"The classic Age of Empires 2 with the expansion pack. Not entirely unchanged, but any changes can be reversed in the AOE workshop. good game :)"
After I have played 1 game I can truly say I enjoyed it! 9/10
"A classic brought to HD. I'm not particularly a fan of RTS games, but ever since I played this game several years ago, I've been longing to play it again, and buying here on steam was worth it. Definitely worth picking up and giving it a try."
I like this game!  It is good. I enjoy it when I win.  I is good.
"Does not matter how much time passes, this game will be awesome forever "
If you have never heard of this game before you haven't lived  BUY IT! 
"Excellent game, true to the original! dat pathfinding tho..."
Such a great re-creation of Age of Empires II. I would highly reccomend this game to any RTS fan! This game stays very true to its beginnings and has had great graphical updates to much of the game especially the water graphics.
I can't believe they are adding to this game after so many years!
"Nice work on this game, I've missed it."
They did a great job bringing this classic back.With the addition of HD graphics this game is very fun to play versus computer and friends alike.I got a 4 pack at a great price a while ago to play with my friends and I absolutely recommend this game.
"This was one of my favorite games a long time ago, and now that I found it again and started playing it reminds me of how much time I had spent on this game. I love the game and even though its pretty old now it is still one of my favorite games."
"Age of empires 2 HD.. Nothing bad to say. Graphics are great. The strategy elements are awesome! And it's difficult in its own special way. I highly recommend this game if you're new to strategy games. It's by far the best to get into and it's really fun and easy to understand. There are a few bad things ofcourse like:  Not being able to select all your soldiers at once. Soldiers not listen to you and go on their own way.  But for the rest, great game.  This game gets a 9/10  Great game!"
monks and ♥♥♥♥
i like to execute all the girl vilagers unles there are work at the food producton
&gt;Best RTS &gt;HD graphics &gt;Great online &gt;Even better price  A Wolo-lot of bang for your buck. Buy this.
"Love This Game! Is it Perfect? No, but close! :o)"
"A good friend of mine requested I get the game, and I did. For an older game it is quite fun to mess around with and it's worth the money."
It's Age of Empires 2. In HD and with workshop support. Need I say more?
"I bought this game when I saw it on Steam, because that was one of my favorite games a few years ago. It also seemed quite nice that the Microsoft doesn't give up the old games, and they see the potential in them. So do I. The content seems a bit little, but hey are working on it to improve! (hopefully)  Overall, I can recommend this game. I had a lot of fun playing it, even 5-6 years back."
Played this game a long time ago when it was only on CD. Really glad they re-released on steam with better resolutions. I've always enjoyed this game and liked it much better than the sequel.  Haven't checked what it's selling for now but it's worth a play if you have the time or the money.
"I have palyed Aoe II for most of my life, it was one of the first games i played. When I found out that they had made an HD edition with an expansion, I jumped to buy iy, now i have grwon to appricate the sheer vastness of opurtunities there are when playing."
"Honestly, the game is pretty dated. I play it with a friend who played it a long while back.  It's a decently fun game. Nowadays it's simply not good enough to suck me in, make me play it alone as someone new to the series. However, I can see completely why people who liked the game when they were younger would want to play it again, because the game is about as good as these older games get, and is probably exactly what those who played AoEII in the past will expect from it.  -----  Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty satisfying. You build up a small kingdom by constructing various buildings to produce different bonuses for your 'empire.' However, the thrill of seeing the little settlers at work eventually turns into the disappointment of having to actually fight people with a cumbersome system that rewards spamming swarms of units instead of actually having any real tactics whatsoever. If I could give the pre-battle and post-battle parts of each game two separate scores, it'd be 7.5/10 and 4/10, but as it is I'll just give the whole thing a  6/10 .  Graphics/Visual Experience: It's an old game, but it's not hard to tell what's going on. When playing, I do feel 'sucked in' to the game's environment. However, units have a tendency to clump up when there are enough of them (and more often than not, there is), which makes things difficult.  7.5/10   Sound: The game doesn't feel cluttered with unnecessary soundbytes or loud music. The music creates a good feeling but I personally found it grating after a while. The experience, however, is not ruined by Spotify running quietly in the background. It's a game that demands attention, so the game's natural ambiance caters to that requirement.  6.5/10   Replayability: Pretty good. Each game has the potential to play out differently from the one before.  8/10   How it Runs: It's an older game so unless you're trying to run it on a TI-83, it'll probably work."
"best RTS on the market even though it is 10+ years old every game is unique &amp; challenging, online experiance is awesome &amp; elo scoring system means that every skill level can play."
"Age of Empires 2 was already my favorite RTS of all time. Excellent balance between civs, outstanding civ selection, outstanding map and game mode variety, good balance between economy management and combat as well and macro vs micro control. Controls are tight and system specs are relatively low. Basically, by virtually any measure of an RTS this game, this game nails it. Of course the graphics are still relatively dated but the color palette and sprites used are still just fine and rather pleasant to look at. Even before this reboot, there was a lot to this game, but now there is tons of new, worthwhile content that complements what was already there. Multiplayer is now easy and worthwhile with matchmaking and an elo system that should put you in the same ballpark as your opponent. Definitely pick up this edition, the Steam Workshop makes mods a snap. My only gripes, and they are minor, multiplayer sometimes lags and there still isn't a 'make your own civ' options for singleplayer/non-ranked multiplayer games despite all the development that has gone into it to date. These things take nothing from what is already here however. This is a classic in the best sense of the term. Score 9.6"
Its a great game
"Amazing Game. Extremely fun and addicting. With 100hr on this game I can easily state with confidence that this is by far the best game I have ever played. It has an amazing variation of different upgrades, troops and buildings but also somehow keeps things fairly simple, (not as complicated as it seems). In the end I strongly recommend this game, been playing this for around 6 years but just got this game on steam about half a year ago."
Great Game. Really fun with a few friends.
"One of the few games that you can play over and over. It never gets boring, even after years it's still fascinating."
perfect game .....thumbs up....:-)
"An Old'n'gold classic game. Good port, Good fun, Lots of people still play online.  "
I love this game and have been playing on and off since release that said the HD verision with the increased resolution and being able to play online with friends again is enough to get my recommendation. If you are into rts games and have never played aoe2 then this is a must buy. 10/10
"It's amazing that a 17 year old video game can still keep me enthralled for hours on end. I remember being shown this game at a friends house when I was a teenager, and I was immediately captivated by the medieval setting. I would spend hours in the Scenario maker designing my own medieval lands and the online games I played with my friends were so fun we would talk about it the day after at school. I couldn't wait to get home and play AOE2, again!  I played AOE3 a bit and AOM quit extensively, the latter being a very good game in it's own right, but there's just something about AOE2 that resonates something deep inside me to this day. I didn't know about the HD remake until last year, and when I found it I had to get the game, again! The graphics still hold up, and with hundreds of community mods in the workshop the game has a lot of appeal to almost anyone out there. I'm impressed with the amount of attention Creative Assembly have poured into the game, most notably the new expansions and added units and civilizations, new maps and map sizes, the game really feels twice as much more than it did in the past.  The only thing that irks me about the game, and has done so since day one, are the vast array of units that every civilization shares. There are a few unique units that each civilization has all to their own, but it's still a little off putting seeing an army of European man-at-arms being recruited from a Japanese barracks or swarming the jungles of the Aztecs and Mayans. But that's what AOE2 has always been about, I suppose. It's a small complaint and doesn't take away at all of the true core gaming experience. And with the aforementioned community mods available, a lot of fine folks have alleviated this problem, a bit.   If you're a huge fan of medieval gaming, you may want to check this one out. If you enjoy real time strategy games, well this is one of the most classic examples of the genre and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you passed AOE2 up.  If you can stomach the price for a 17 year old game, it is worth it, but if you're patient enough to wait for it to go on sale it would truly be a steal. It would be most worthwhile to purchase all of the added expansions as well to get the full AOE2 experience. I waited until the Summer Sale because I wanted to also purchase it for my girlfriend, who I am trying to get into the game and although she really doesn't play any games whatsoever, she can't resist just how damn fun this one is, especially playing online, together.   Online is a whole other story. Personally I haven't dabbled too much into online with people I didn't know, as my skills aren't quite up to par to the general level. But I'm starting to be a little more brave and I really don't mind getting my butt handed to me as it's quite a learning experience and still much fun to be had, as long as it doesn't happen too often!  So long story short, if you haven't heard of this game before, get out from under that rock you've been living under and experience one of the most timeless, funnest, most in depth games ever created. And for those who have played the original before but felt they've grown out of it, well be prepared to spend more countless hours falling in love with it all over again, as I have!"
One of my favorite games of all time!
I built a sheep army. Nuff Said.  Buy this game.
"This is without a doubt the greatest real-time strategy game I have ever played. It's challenging and spontaneous and if I win I feel a grand sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that I did it myself without the game's help. When I lose I don't give up until it's truly over, even if I have to seek refuge in the forest on a far corner of the map with my few remaining villagers and one man-at-arms to defend them, slowly rebuilding my once-great civilization. This game is unbelievably well-balanced - each civilization in the game has its own ups and downs but ultimately it is the player that causes his/her own victory. You can build great fortifications of walls and towers around your city, creating an enormous and impenetrable stronghold. You can chop down an entire forest and manage fifty farms and ten mines, stimulating an economy that will allow you to recover rapidly from countless battles, which will in turn let you slowly weaken your opponents through unrelenting raids. You can act peaceful while amassing a secret army of knights, battering rams, archers, cavalry, and petards (self-destructing bomb guys), then blitzkrieg straight through the middle of somebody's village, destroying houses and mills not because you need to but because you want to, and then when all is said and done tear down every last castle and town center within their walls. You can take an island for yourself and create a perimeter of walls and guard towers along the shore, then defend it with a diverse navy of flamethrower boats and massive warships, occasionally sending a small force of twenty galleons to harass your enemies into submission. You can accumulate enough resources to construct and defend a structure of such greatness that your civilization will eventually be recognized as the ultimate empire, claiming victory by sheer impressiveness. You can have your city study smithing and academics so that despite having the smallest army you may still pose the greatest threat to your enemies. You can BUILD A GREAT WALL. You can practice devout faith in your God, so much so that the soldiers of your enemies will convert and join alongside you in your quest which is truly the most righteous. And if none of that appeals then you can always just say ♥♥♥♥ it and go out with a bang. The possibilities are limitless in this game.   Pros: +you can do virtually whatever you want to succeed +lots of civilizations to choose from with unique technology trees +many difficulty levels for AI if you have no friends +a bunch of story arcs if you want to do something more than just battle (why would you?) +five ways to end a match that I can think of off the top of my head - there are probably more +infinite ways to reach those five ways +custom map maker +you control everything +you can commit genocide and not feel bad about it +great tutorial that nobody ever plays +funny accents in the storylines +many different gamemodes and map styles +wololo  Cons: -in the Crusades storyline you have to play as the Saracens -moving around the map is weird at first -playing against people who are really aggresive in the first 10 minutes (my brother) is really annoying if it happens to you (every single time)  Neutral: =old graphics may bother you if you're a baby who's never played games on a potato before"
My favorite RTS game of all time. This game has passed the test of time for good reason. Gameplay is excellent. Units are well balanced and multiplayer is unparalleled.
"In a sentence , history lessons for gamers with much wololo involved."
"Yeah this game's got some hecktic skids going on for it, really good, really OLD RTS game 10/10 would buy again"
it is a great game 
Very fun to play with friends.. but needs a patch or something to help fix the multiplayer lag
"Korean, steel, most advanced Elite Turtle ships get brought down by arrows. 10/10"
one of the best classics.
"Fantastic Game! It's everything I loved from when I was a kid just in beautiful HD now. The Forgotten relms expansion pack adds more cultures with great new units and unique abilities. The game is well worth the money, great nostalga for us who played the original over 10 years ago, and still an excellent stratagie for young gamers getting into the genre."
Not as good as Age of Empires 1
"I got all my friends to buy this by chanting 'whololo'  Er... wait, did they Whololo me.  10/10 Would Whololo again."
"A superb game that has thoroughly stood up to the test of time. The gameplay remains just as superb as I remember it from my youth, and is equally as enthralling now as it was then.  I would argue that this is no more HD than the original one is - the animations, even the sprites, feel barely changed from their original resolution in the original AOEII.   Its graphics hence look a little dated, but it should run on 99% of computers at a silky smooth framerate, so grab it if you want a slice of gaming history."
I love this game!!!  All its needs is to be available on MAC!
"An all-time favorit of mine. Great gameplay, lots of tactical and strategic combat, well researched historic campaigns, and epic multiplayer fun. Enjoy!"
"15 years now and this game still holds its own and heck it's more fun and competative than most modern day strategy games. I couldn't have imagined that i would be playing it 15 years later as a teenager. Sadly this version lacks the most important part of AoE2, Lan games. It makes up with a decent resolution and some decent online gamemaking but you can still pick up your old copy and play with pals without missing much from this HD edition. For around 5 euros in sales it's a must buy."
This game is amazing. Definitely worth getting it. Brings back a lot of childhood memories!
"Even though the multiplayer still has some malfunctions it's worth playing. Back then I enjoyed countless hours in this game, and I'll continue with it. I'd suggest to make this game cheaper, though, so more players get motivated to buy it. Great game to let time pass by at times."
One of the best games of my childhood.
Great way to bring back the elementary school memories.
A must have game of 2013.
hitting farms and stone gates with swords makes them catch on fire/10
"The 'High definition' in the name is misleading, the game graphis are not updated to HD standards. It just allows you to play the game in any aspect ratio and screen resolution/sizes, a bigger screen shows you more of your land, not in a better resolution.  Apart from that, this game is wat it used to be: addictive with both a lot of fun in the campaigns and online multiplayer games. The AI played opponents are not that intelligent but scripted well enough in the campaigns."
Cant get any better than a classic AoE!
"I bought this game when I saw it on Steam, because that was one of my favorite games a few years ago. It also seemed quite nice that the Microsoft doesn't give up the old games, and they see the potential in them. So do I. The content seems a bit little, but hey are working on it to improve! (hopefully)  Overall, I can recommend this game. I had a lot of fun playing it, even 5-6 years back."
"Easily one of the best RTS games of all time -- right up there with Starcraft. Still tremendously popular and if you get the Forgotten Expansion, you'll love the bit of extra variety it breathes into this old classic.  If you're reading this, you probably alread own the CD version of the game and unless you want to play multiplayer games online, you don't really need the HD version. However, the ease with which you can find games and join lobbies via Steam is well worth the $20 price tag for a game that's older than half my siblings."
sick shizzle
"I played this game when it first came out and it was my hands down favorite game, maybe because it was the only Rated T for Teen game my mother would let me play. Regardless, I was very excited to see that it was going to be available on steam. I bought the early access and with over 240 hours of play time, I would completely recommend this game.   Microsoft has done an excellent job revamping the graphics without losing the original feel of the game. The units, buildings and game mechanics are exactly as I remembered and the ability to play multiplayer once again is a dream come true for me. The interface is about the same and the Lobby Browser System for multiplayer is quite easy to use. The Lobby is always full and there is always a game to be had. Creating a game is just as easy and the kick user from lobby function never really has to be used. The player base is fairly mature, but entirely intolerant of “noobs”. I’d suggest playing through a few of the campaigns before jumping right into multiplayer like I did. The players in the chat can be very unhelpful, prefer to yell at you in all caps rather than provide suggestions. There is a learning curve but by playing a few single player games and 4v4 multiplayer games, it is very easy to be a decent well rounded player. 10/10 would recommend.   I have not played the Forgotten Expansion pack so I have no place to review that.  This game is a no brainer if you liked the original release or if you like RTS/RPG style games. It is a very tempting buy if it gets below $10 and an absolute steal below $5. I’d also recommend buying the 4 pack and getting some friends to play with. That way, you can hone your skills without the ridicule of others.     "
"The best RTS of its generation, what else do you need to know? It's Age of Empires II!  But seriously though, don't expect too much from the 'HD' tag. Graphic wise it's more or less the same with a few improvements and a zoom-out camera. The most annoying thing from the original AoK imo is unit pathfinding, and they still haven't bothered to fix it.  Still, it's Age of Empires II, on Steam!  9/10"
"An excellent throwback to long-time fans with crisp new graphics. The added civilizations add a fun sense of freshness to the original batch. The new campaigns, though fun and entertaining, fail to live up to their predecessors (lack of audio plays a huge part I think). Ultimately, the new content and the cleaner graphics do make this a worthy purchase for long-time fans."
An oldie but a goodie!!! Enough said :-P
"Age of Empires is  the  RTS game!  Once watched my ally use &gt;80 infantry to chase 5 sheep, a monk, and a trade cart around the map for 20 minutes, whilst I sat behind rows of fortified walls and castles farming and converting enemy houses.  9/10 would forget my military again."
"It's Age of Empires II, the greatest game of all time."
The only game that can make 10 hours feel like 2      10/10
Great game that I'm glad to see become easily available to the newer versions of Windows. Well worth the money for nostalgia.
You'll be walking into a fine ♥♥♥ game if you walk into this one
Wololololo..... This games is awesome! 100/10
Very nice classic RTS game with a great community with many streamers and other friendly people who will help you try and get better at the game so that you can have an enjoyable expierence playing the game.
I've been playing since 2006 and it's still a phenomenal game.
"  I do not have a bunch of hours put into this game on steam but i used toplay thisso much with my brother because we had the disc that you had to install and we would only play against bots or on Lan so a friend bought me this game so i can play online. I love this game, its so fun because of the gigantic wars going on. I gotthis game so i could play online and show off my 'skills' (I lost alot) even though i did lose about every single match i still have fun playing it to this day"
"You get countless hours of fun with this ♥♥♥♥♥; my first game ever, and couldn't have been any better. This steam version mantains the feel of the original, if you have friends, get the 4 pack."
"This is one of my favorite RTS games, not because it has the most innovative system or gameplay, but because it is easy to play and pays attention to the details. The fact that each civilization uses it's own language, the architecture fits the location and the scenarios reflect real events. It's perfect for someone who wants to get involved in history, not just something to be read in a book. It sounds absurd, but I learned so much about history by playing this game: Who Saladin was, the history of the Aztecs, how to pronounce Quetzalcoatl (Not how to spell it; I need to look that one up). I've spent literal months of my life playing this game for the last 15 years, and I can't imagine I'll stop now."
"Older it is , better it gets it seems. This game is like the father of the strategy games. People say that this game sucks because it's not hd at all... And i should say 'You should be new in here'. Since this game got an expansion pack, it showed up everyone that this game is still alive . Lots of civilization, terrains, mods and new units... it makes the whole game more interesting and intense ! Things to do in this game never ever ends !"
Solid game. Fun back when it came out and still fun now. Wish more people knew about it.
have played this game years ago and still play it time and time again love this game.
Great game needs more players
"This game is great! I owned the disk version of this and I used to play it all the time on my first computer a long time ago, a remastered HD edition is just what this game needed. The fact that the game is still alive and well after all these years just shows you how this game has stood the test of time. Some of the most fun I've ever had on steam is crushing friends and family alike in local online games in massive scale games. Its great for casual and competitive play alike, however it does have a pretty steep learning curve. If you're unsure check it out on YouTube or something first but if you like the RTS genre, this one is a classic."
9/11 Would Wololo again
"I really like AoE II, I've only ever played 2 and I'll stand by it.  But god damn do I hate the AI 9/10s of the time in a skirmish game, that goes for both AI's included in the base game. Luckily there are AI scripts on the workshop, sadly they can get even more irrational depending on their supported scenarios :s  Still it's a good remake, if you ever played AoE II growing up and had long evenings of playing it, I really doubt you wouldn't have a couple more long one's with this."
"It may be an 'old' game as they say, but still a good way to spend time with friends. :)"
"Ao2 is one of the best games that I ever played. The hours I have on this is wrong, since I played this long before it came on steam. Would buy for the 3rd time."
Legendary game that always has a place in my heart. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Best game I've ever played in my entire god damn life.
the game I fell in love with many years ago inspite of its limitations. imagine my excitement with the HD edition that not only enhanced the gameplay mechanics plus added some new missions in the campaign.   
This was going to be a bad review but then Wololo! happened.
"The original Age of Empires II is was my favourite PC game, without question.  The HD edition fixes all manner of issues that plagued the original on modern systems, replaces the long-discontinued microsoft gaming zone with the steam lobby, and adds workshop support. I can't speak to the latter, having not tried to add any mods yet, but working multiplayer and fixing the graphics glitches are more than enough to breath new life into the game for me.  The HD addition also increases the highest population cap setting in random map games to 500, and the Forgotten DLC adds (among other things) a larger map size.  In summary, this is a good reimplementation of classic game. And if you get it on sale, it won't cost you a fortune."
Ruined my life. 10/10
"The HD release of one of the best RTS games ever released ask for quite a hefty price considering how old the game is and how easy it is to get hold of the original game's copy for fraction of this release's price - however the support for modern OS, workshop integration, stable server provision, new DLCs, bug fixes and optimalizations make this purchase worth it.  And on the topic of AoE2 in general - this game never gets old, retaining all of its playability even after more than 15 years of its original release - definetly try this out and you will not be disapointed."
"Woooah, it's like jumping back in time. I löve Age of Empires!"
I have been playing this game since I was a kid and no matter how much time passes it stays as one of my favorites. I'm glad that they updated it with better graphics and more gameplay options.
"Time consuming, yet very formidible."
"Best game ever! I never get tired of playing this game, for me every match is unique. The only downside is that the multpalyer is sometimes very lagy, fix that and the game is AMAZING!"
"A really solid strategy game. Even if it has countless years under its belt, it still manages to improve over time and has aged very well. It has a great community and a fun multiplayer (although it lags somtimes). Overall a very good game."
Old but gold
"If there's a game that did nearly as well as the 'wololo' of AoE 1, it had to be AoE2. In a rare instance where a successor elevates a well-loved game to the realm of competitive possibilities, AoE2 set the platform for further sequels and while it will never be Starcraft, AoE remains what it is: a forerunner."
"You're still playing this old ♥♥♥ game? Oh, wait, so am I!"
"Nice game, recommended!"
Beautifully created game All time favorite for sure 
Hands down one of the best games ever made. Still enjoyable to this day.
Pure perfection
"I spent far too much hours on this game.This is the remake I was hoping for. Except for some lag when playing multiplayer with a lot of units, I'm not able to say something negative."
1080P AoE2 with no bugs on new systems.
"A MUST HAVE game for all strategy fans, this game never get's boring, and that while the original is over 10 years old by now."
"You know what it is. The old school of old school. AOE2. The bee's knees. Why are you reading this? You know this sh*t is the bomb. You've played it before, and if you haven't you're an alien species from another planet. This game will never die. A classic for the ages."
"One of the best RTS games every made, my personal favourite. Good to have a HD version to easily play online over steam and mods accessable through steam workshop. Amazing Campaigns, and overall perfect game, I'd highly recommend it."
"THIS GAME IS SO AWSOME, THERE ARE NO DOWNSIDES AND THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVA, besides rome total war and rome total war 2"
From how many hours i currently spent on this game all i can say is that this game is very damn good it may lack a wide variety of units but by its judging by its gameplay making it a very good and fun game for all of guys who expect a good graphics LOL its says HD it just Varnished the 2D Version it does not say Age of Empires 2 3D LoL anyway back to the game its very great im new to AoE2 but all i can say this is a great Masterpiece of Ensemble Studios 9/10
"i love this game, after how ever many years its still fun, and what a amazing story line."
"The game of my childhood, I recommend this game 100%"
pure beauty from my childhood
"Even though old, still enjoyable, but has problems with stability when updated to newer versions."
this is truly a magnificent game
"You're still playing this old ♥♥♥ game? Oh, wait, so am I!"
"Nice game, recommended!"
Beautifully created game All time favorite for sure 
Hands down one of the best games ever made. Still enjoyable to this day.
Pure perfection
"I spent far too much hours on this game.This is the remake I was hoping for. Except for some lag when playing multiplayer with a lot of units, I'm not able to say something negative."
Just like the old game! Brings back a lot of memories. There are several good community-made mods to enhance the HD graphics that are very worth adding.
"A classic, indeed. I never get bored with Age of Empires II. Each scenerio is unqiue to the last, and you never know what to expect with the re-programmed AI. Lots of memories fall from this game from when I was younger, and I can proudly say it hasn't lost it's zing."
I grew up with this game and was suprised to find it on steam. They seem to have updated some of it but the most important thing about it is the online play. I never got to play online all those years ago but now it's like a brand new game built off an old favorite.
Best game you've ever played!
My favorite RTS game of all time. This game has passed the test of time for good reason. Gameplay is excellent. Units are well balanced and multiplayer is unparalleled.
"This is without a doubt the greatest real-time strategy game I have ever played. It's challenging and spontaneous and if I win I feel a grand sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that I did it myself without the game's help. When I lose I don't give up until it's truly over, even if I have to seek refuge in the forest on a far corner of the map with my few remaining villagers and one man-at-arms to defend them, slowly rebuilding my once-great civilization. This game is unbelievably well-balanced - each civilization in the game has its own ups and downs but ultimately it is the player that causes his/her own victory. You can build great fortifications of walls and towers around your city, creating an enormous and impenetrable stronghold. You can chop down an entire forest and manage fifty farms and ten mines, stimulating an economy that will allow you to recover rapidly from countless battles, which will in turn let you slowly weaken your opponents through unrelenting raids. You can act peaceful while amassing a secret army of knights, battering rams, archers, cavalry, and petards (self-destructing bomb guys), then blitzkrieg straight through the middle of somebody's village, destroying houses and mills not because you need to but because you want to, and then when all is said and done tear down every last castle and town center within their walls. You can take an island for yourself and create a perimeter of walls and guard towers along the shore, then defend it with a diverse navy of flamethrower boats and massive warships, occasionally sending a small force of twenty galleons to harass your enemies into submission. You can accumulate enough resources to construct and defend a structure of such greatness that your civilization will eventually be recognized as the ultimate empire, claiming victory by sheer impressiveness. You can have your city study smithing and academics so that despite having the smallest army you may still pose the greatest threat to your enemies. You can BUILD A GREAT WALL. You can practice devout faith in your God, so much so that the soldiers of your enemies will convert and join alongside you in your quest which is truly the most righteous. And if none of that appeals then you can always just say ♥♥♥♥ it and go out with a bang. The possibilities are limitless in this game.   Pros: +you can do virtually whatever you want to succeed +lots of civilizations to choose from with unique technology trees +many difficulty levels for AI if you have no friends +a bunch of story arcs if you want to do something more than just battle (why would you?) +five ways to end a match that I can think of off the top of my head - there are probably more +infinite ways to reach those five ways +custom map maker +you control everything +you can commit genocide and not feel bad about it +great tutorial that nobody ever plays +funny accents in the storylines +many different gamemodes and map styles +wololo  Cons: -in the Crusades storyline you have to play as the Saracens -moving around the map is weird at first -playing against people who are really aggresive in the first 10 minutes (my brother) is really annoying if it happens to you (every single time)  Neutral: =old graphics may bother you if you're a baby who's never played games on a potato before"
Great revamp of an outstanding classic though the optimisation needs to be improved.
"This game is the best stragey game I have ever played! Even though this is a 10 year old game, it is AMAZING to play. It is also awesome if you have alot of friends who have this game."
"I was playing the game for about 10 minutes then got raided and destroyed.   I was confused why I was so brutally attacked by militia cavemen dudes, so I went back to check my settings. Apparently while I wasn't looking, I changed the map size to smallest with 8 players and on the hardest difficulty.  10/10 would militia again."
Improved classic. Awesome. Simple as that.
"For better or for worse, this is the only place where one can reasonable still play Age of Kings online. It has much improved compared to when it first was realeased on steam: it is finally playable, and people are actually playing maps other than arabia, and games other than conquest."
"I love this game I played it as a small child, and it still has a lot of replay value as an older teen. It is great and it is easy to pick up, hard to master. I really like this game and I think, as well as many other people, that you should buy it."
The game of my childhood.  Still an active community so go ahead and buy it.
"Enjoyable with a small slice of 'History', and multiplayer is enjoyable."
"It's not that different from the original, just better resolution options. But, you know, how do you improve on perfection."
"During my freshman year of high school, my old history teacher made all of his classes play this game, and we would all play in the computer lab he rented out for us. He even made it work for LAN so each class would play against each other at their period.  It's that good.   "
Love playing this game with my friends. Despite being an old game it is one of the best ones I've ever played if you love real time strategy (RTS) games then this is the game for you. It is a bit pricey I must say but it is worth it.
"The fact that there is an official expansion to a game this old ought to give you an idea of what a timeless classic this truly is. While it may not have the bells and whistles of more recent RTS games, the balance, the mechanics, and the setting all make for one of the best RTS games ever made."
I wish they didn't charge for the people who bought the CD version in the 90's but I guess the dlc could be worth it. Sadly I couldn't find anyone online to play a multiplayer but then again I am a little rusty on my RTS skills since the last time I played age of empires was in 2003. (original version non HD).  Because windows 10 no longer supports the non HD version I had to buy this but like I mentioned above the DLC with new civilizations and campaigns are worth it. I'd also like to mention I bought it during a discount phase at a reasonable price.  I hope I get the chance to play online but then again it's a fine single player game and the AI can provide a challenge if you are new to RTS games.  I'd recommend you wait for a discounted price before purchasing this title since it is a game developed in the late 90's and you could as well fine more modern RTS with a similar price tag.
"I get a very Stronghold: Crusader vibe when I think of this game. However, I think this game is way easier to pick up and learn. Managing your 'economy' is much easier in this game as well. Once you get the hang of it, those maches you play that last an hour and a half, only feel like ten minutes. Once you understand it, this game gets addicting. Worth the money Definitely"
Old school Age of Empires 2 with extra content and smarter AI! Love it! A technical masterpiece
"I used to play this game on disc ages ago and I am thrilled to see it back again on Steam!  Great game - tactics, strategy, violence and a bit of luck! Great pre-set challenges or if you'd rather surprise yourself try a random map game! I love that because it's on Steam you can play multiplayer with friends or strangers! Definitely adds a new dimension playing a human not a CPU. You can also create your own maps if you're feeling creative. I really think this game has something for everyone!  Definitely recommend!"
I played this as a child and I play it again today... And it is still AMAZING!
"this game is so f-ing buggy how the hell r u supposed to play it? not even half as good as the origional, nice try though, good (half-♥♥♥♥♥) effort!! and i'd like my money back!!"
Now this is a game that stands the test of time
The Age of Empires collection is one of my favorite. Age of Empires II is a nostalgic medieval game that can retain your attention for hours. I highly recommend this game.
For me it's one the best games ever. I love it.
"A remake of a great classic - I've played Age of Empires II almost since it came out.  The new graphics and settings are very handy - you can now play with a population limit of up to 500.  The main reason I bought this game, though, is for the Steam Integration. With that, it is now easy to set up multiplayer games with friends all over the world."
 Rating this game 9 of 10!
Great revival of a classic game!
"  I do not have a bunch of hours put into this game on steam but i used toplay thisso much with my brother because we had the disc that you had to install and we would only play against bots or on Lan so a friend bought me this game so i can play online.

One of the all-time greats! Been playing it since the original Age of Empires and still love it!

This is a really fun game for anyone who wants a good game
Hey it's preety good
REALLY fun game I recommend this to EVERYONE. Fun to play with FRIENDS ! 9.9/10
"Its an old game, theres not really much to know. Its an RTS with Melee, Range, Mounted and Siege. In general, they have their own strengths, with buffs based on which race you are playing. Thats in general, but in practice you'll find that Ranged units will just kite the hell out of EVERY single unit, even if its ranged. There are grand walls and castles you can build! But they get outranged by siege which they couldnt hurt anyway because of ridiculously high pierce armour.   If you like RTSs, this is one. Fun with Friends."
Overall just like the old game. Thumbs up. :)
Great strategy game to play with friends!
Solid game. Fun back when it came out and still fun now. Wish more people knew about it.
have played this game years ago and still play it time and time again love this game.
Great game needs more players

Now this is a game that stands the test of time
The Age of Empires collection is one of my favorite. Age of Empires II is a nostalgic medieval game that can retain your attention for hours. I highly recommend this game.
awsome game
"Great game. Like the classic AoE that I played when it still worked on Windows. Just don't buy it for full price; it goes on a %80 sale all the time. Also, if it is on sale get the Forgotten expansion for an extra $2.  PROS: Like the orginal in many ways. Works on newer versions of Windows (I have Windows 10). New techs and units that come with the expansion are fun to play. New AI is much harder. Much easier to play mutli player (except for saving, see below) CONS: haven't figured out how to save mutli-player games yet, which is a bummer since me and my friends can't play for long stretches of time normally. "
Outstanding game. The father of modern strategy games (alongside Warcraft and Starcraft)
From how many hours i currently spent on this game all i can say is that this game is very damn good it may lack a wide variety of units but by its judging by its gameplay making it a very good and fun game for all of guys who expect a good graphics LOL its says HD it just Varnished the 2D Version it does not say Age of Empires 2 3D LoL anyway back to the game its very great im new to AoE2 but all i can say this is a great Masterpiece of Ensemble Studios 9/10
You can't play this on Win XP GJ Microsoft 10/10 move would XP again xdddddddddddd I got win 10 guys XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD no one cares
"This game is good. Hell, even this review   might   be good?"
"Oldies but goldies! Great RTS game, great multiplayer and single player experience. Get some of your friends and have fun together."
finally we can play it again!
"One of the best strategy games. Good gameplay with great balance between economy and warfare. Recommended both to those who like building a large empire and those who like besieging an enemy one. It provides a large variety of units, game options and game types, including historical campaigns. Each civilization has its own pros and cons based on history, allowing you to develop many strategies considering the enemy forces and yours. With an easy to use map editor, where you can create and play your own scenario. Not outstanding but good graphics. Easy to learn the basics but requires practice to get used to it."
-starts game -builds epic army -gets completely destroyed -one villager lives -builds empire again -wrecks everyone  10/10 would get rekt again
"This game is very good, it makes me so happy that i go home everyday ,coat myself in butter and pretend im snail, eating leaves and ooching around the floor"
what does this game have? Petards=ISIS Monks that carries relic that bigger then them Hand cannoneer=Mlg No Scope Onager that kill your teammate too Finnaly WOLOLO
had a boat that was sailing on land  10/10 would break physics again
Pretty good...
"Love it. I played the crap out of this game as a child. Very happy that it's on Steam. For anyone who want's to start an RTS, highly recommend this. 10/10"
This game is amazing. Definitely worth getting it. Brings back a lot of childhood memories!
"I have never really played RTS games but I think I found a true gem at the first try. Even though this game is nearly two decades old, it's still going strong. With its great game mechanics, excellent storytelling and tons of different options to customise the experience it is the origin and trendsetter of all modern RTS games. For example the graphics  don't necessarily need to be so good in game like this - You can still spend many enjoyable and intense  hours playing this game. AOE 2 is worth every penny!"
Best childhood game
"Very fun game. I used to play it at my cousins house in San Diego, California many years ago. Its the pinnacle of real-time strategy, and deserves to be in the museum of greatest games of all time."
Best game of all time :D
"I grew up playing this game, and it is (after hundreds of hours of game play, mostly not on steam) one of my favorite games to this day. It's both fun to do alone and fun to do with friends."
"First match I played got me so into the game that i totally forgot about the time and finshed the match 3 hours later.   Tutorial is useless, ask your friends for explainations.  But other wise, an amazing game. "
"One of my favorite games that i have ever played. After around seven years of not playing this game and coming back to it, its still fun as hell. IF your looking for a strategy game then you have come to the right place. The best strategy game ever made, in my opinion. The DLC is worth it too, if your looking into buying the DLC also.TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS MASTERPIECE."
A game that defined our childhood. Nuff' said.   Still badass !
One of my favourite games. Played it when I was a lot younger and still like playing it now.
Great Game! Fun to play with your friends. As fun as it was back in the day.
it's the same old game it's not HD but worth the play
"Considering that the orignal games graphics were clunky and bland, this game is defiantly a great visual remake of the old one and it also has the great mechanics of the oringal"
"A classic bought back up to standard. Netcode can be buggy at times, but mostly solid regardless."
great game :D worth the 18$ :D
My favorite RTS game of all time. This game has passed the test of time for good reason. Gameplay is excellent. Units are well balanced and multiplayer is unparalleled.
This game is good y'hear?!
Best game you've ever played!
"It is so worth buying the HD remake, after I played several hours of it as a child. It still gets support, and with the steam workshop supported, it is guaranteed that it will be supported a long time from now on.   There is only one negative thing about it: Multiplayer slightly feels, like it was powered by Internet Explorer. When I play the original on Voobly, for example, that problem doesn´t exist. All in all it´s a 9/10 for me."
This game is amazing! I had played it back when I had played it back when I was a child. It brings me back good memories. anyways right now the game is 85% off and is $3.29. It is worth it.   I rate this game a 9/10
Buy It!
"I grew up with this game, and am very happy to see it on Steam!  It may be kinda dated compared to other games, but this game is still a very fun strategy game, and I love it to bits!"
"I would definitely recommend this if you've played this since childhood. I really love the game, and I really like the improvement made to this game. To be honest, this and all of its DLC's are worth it if you wanna play new campaigns and play as new different civilisations. Really fun, 10 outta 10."
"Very nice game, although I only got to play it once because Steam wouldn't let me open it. Something about ' You must have Steam running to open the application ' when I CLEARLY did!!! Anyway, great graphics, but if you don't like them, you can always download the graphics mods on the workshop.  Sometimes it can be a tad bit confusing though. And it can REALLY get laggy when you have a load of units in one place.  Overall: 8/10."
I am a Noob with the online version and find it difficult to compete against others.  Enjoy the game playing the PC so just need to get into it more and do some research without cheats to enahnce the experience.
You Know.
I grew up with this game and was suprised to find it on steam. They seem to have updated some of it but the most important thing about it is the online play. I never got to play online all those years ago but now it's like a brand new game built off an old favorite.
I learned the phrase 'thy vor blow my ♥♥♥♥ thy' from a raging noob. money well spent.
A nice game of my childhood and i still playing it :D
9/11 Would Wololo again
This is one of the greatest games in the pc gaming world. This game is a timeless classic and I highly recommend this game.
Love this game!
Still one of the best games in the world!!! But we need bigger fan base. Cmon buy it and lets play
legendary game.

"AoE series are very good games, but AoE2 was one of my favorite games when i was a kid. Having the chance to play an HD version of it is completely amazing but also there are new civilizations and unique units you can play with therefore the new content gives you tons of fun."
"This game is great! I owned the disk version of this and I used to play it all the time on my first computer a long time ago, a remastered HD edition is just what this game needed. The fact that the game is still alive and well after all these years just shows you how this game has stood the test of time. Some of the most fun I've ever had on steam is crushing friends and family alike in local online games in massive scale games. Its great for casual and competitive play alike, however it does have a pretty steep learning curve. If you're unsure check it out on YouTube or something first but if you like the RTS genre, this one is a classic."
I love this game and have been playing on and off since release that said the HD verision with the increased resolution and being able to play online with friends again is enough to get my recommendation. If you are into rts games and have never played aoe2 then this is a must buy. 10/10
You can't play this on Win XP GJ Microsoft 10/10 move would XP again xdddddddddddd I got win 10 guys XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD no one cares
"This game is good. Hell, even this review   might   be good?"
"The original Age of Empires II is was my favourite PC game, without question.  The HD edition fixes all manner of issues that plagued the original on modern systems, replaces the long-discontinued microsoft gaming zone with the steam lobby, and adds workshop support. I can't speak to the latter, having not tried to add any mods yet, but working multiplayer and fixing the graphics glitches are more than enough to breath new life into the game for me.  The HD addition also increases the highest population cap setting in random map games to 500, and the Forgotten DLC adds (among other things) a larger map size.  In summary, this is a good reimplementation of classic game. And if you get it on sale, it won't cost you a fortune."
Ruined my life. 10/10
"I have no idea how many hours I have played Age of Empires II and the Conqueror's expansion. I've bought the game multiple times from losing the disks in different moves. Then I went and hadn't played for several years and happened to be looking on Steam and saw there were 2 new expansions and it was remastered in HD. I knew I had to get it instantly.  The graphics are a nice updated on such an old game. And while I haven't gotten as much gameplay on Steam yet, it's been a blast. It brings back a lot of great memories as well.  If you've never played but enjoy RTS games, come and get this and get the game that defined the genre. (Yes, Age of Empires came first, but AoE II's improvements over AoE are what set it apart in my mind.)"
"amazing game, lovedd playing it when i was young but now i have it again and i'm reking it"
"I am preparing for the almighty chinese take over; Cool RTS mechanics, Rad water, Hate the single player."
"a great update to already amazing game! I beyond pleased with the updates made to this game, online server's, mod support, fluid animations and achievements. Definetly worth the price of admission. I can't recomend Age of Empires 2 enough!"
A blast from the past was worth it in the summer sale 2016
awsome fun strategic game 
This game is so much fun.
The best age of empires EVER.
"So old, yet still great to play. The new Ai is challenging as if you were playing starcraft. A real Classic i hope. 10/10 will only put women on farm again."
had a boat that was sailing on land  10/10 would break physics again
Best childhood game
"Where to begin, I've played Aoe2 since it came out when I was like 10 (can't exactly remember) although my steam says I've played for 31 hours, it's probably more like 3,100, perhaps more. I had slowley forgotten it througout my years following high school, (never cared much for aoe3), one day I stumbled upon it on steam, and instantly purchased it, it's a gem that'll never fade, I still feel like a kid without a care in the world when I play it."
"It is so worth buying the HD remake, after I played several hours of it as a child. It still gets support, and with the steam workshop supported, it is guaranteed that it will be supported a long time from now on.   There is only one negative thing about it: Multiplayer slightly feels, like it was powered by Internet Explorer. When I play the original on Voobly, for example, that problem doesn´t exist. All in all it´s a 9/10 for me."
"In a sentence , history lessons for gamers with much wololo involved."
You know you want to...
Good game sahn get it or quit ya know wut im sayin'
I got attacked in the first 5 minutes but repeled it with a army of villagers
It is fun taking over the world!
Muh Childhood is back
Such an old game and still many peoples favorite. number 1 RTS in my books
Turns me on 10/10
"Great game, it's just like I remember it, tons of fun 10/10"
With the updates my game is running very well. I love the multiplayer option.
Oh the memories..
Great Game! But my opinion its the price is to high e buy it when the game are 50% price off or 75%  
If you don't like this classic RTS there is something wrong with you :&lt;
Another classic.
reminiscence of my childhood 10/10  'monk ! I need a monk !' - spammed 134 times / per match
I never know what the villagers are saying. 11/10.
Classic. As good as you remember.
You Should Play This Game Because its Fantastic many many hours of FUN!
"Screw you metacritic, how dare you give this game a 68."
"Like regular Age of Empires 2 Conquerors BUT! Not full of toxic grass, network connection issues and laughable maximum textures/resolutions. Now with 2x the fun and strapped to an overexcitable marmot!"
This game is so much fun.
How can you not like Age of Empires as a PC gamer??  11/10
awsome fun strategic game 
As good as it always been ;)
"Alot of fun!  The classic AoE 2 experience from your childhood but it works on modern systems. New campaigns are decent as well, worth the money if on sale."
"8 Years ago my mum was friends with this lady who had a son like 4 years older than me, and he had a computer full of games, one of the games was Age Of Empire II. I'd sit all day just watching him play it and It was one of the best games I had ever seen. I loved it, it was so detailed and realistic. Eventually my dad got fed up of the woman living with us kinda feeding off of us so he kicked her and the kid out.  Years went by and I tried to remember the games name, to see if I could see it anywhere...no luck.  A few days ago This popped up and I looked at some pics and I realised this was the game, this was the game I'd been looking for for years.  I didn't even stop to think I got it instantly.  This is one of the BEST strategy games to ever be made."
Great game.   Use monks they're good.
&gt;Opens game &gt;Plays toturial &gt;Looks for a multiplayer game &gt;100 hours spent looking for a game &gt;Finds game &gt;gets rushed in fudel &gt; uninstalls 
I play this all the time really fun game you dhould get it!
A blast from the past was worth it in the summer sale 2016
Just as gat dang fun as it was back in the day!
great fun when you play with friends    tough my friends kind of suck atm always playing 2v1 and still winning  r8 it 9/11
Childhood boner  
There's really nothing to say other than the best strategy and childhood game till this day. I've been playing this game since year 2000 when I was only 5 and I have lots of good memories with it. :')
Probably The Single Worst Ga...  WOLOLO  Best Game Ever
"Exactly as it was when you used to have those LAN parties with friends, except that the resolution now looks better. Also great that it has online multiplayer through steam. Brings back fond memories and its an improvement with new added content."
"I've been playing games like this ever since I was around 7 years old, including the older Age of Empires games, Warcraft 3, Starcraft.  Really fun game. I prefer the old building-on-fire effect but the rest of the updates they did with it are nice."
Mongols ate my babies
Very Good game ;=)
"So old, yet still great to play. The new Ai is challenging as if you were playing starcraft. A real Classic i hope. 10/10 will only put women on farm again."
"I've played this game since i was a kid, graphics are hideous especially for an 'HD' edition, but it's worth it for the gameplay alone, I'm personally awful at the game but it's pretty fun getting to the castle age and then getting rekt by some random enemy player"
I spent too many hours on this game when I should have been studying at university ... Still got the shortcuts in my hands :-)
"The definitive version of one of the best strategy games ever made. Compatible with modern PCs, scalable to widescreen monitors, yet still maintaining the multiplayer and mod compatibility of the original AoE 2."
"I got all my friends to buy this by chanting 'whololo'  Er... wait, did they Whololo me.  10/10 Would Whololo again."
"One of best strategic games for multiplayer ever made, plain and simple. Recommended!"
"Favourite RTS brought back and in HD!, minimal lag, great for lanning, and noobs can spam castles and trade carts ~ while villagers fetch sheep."
Not as good as Age of Empires 1
When I was a kid this was my all time favorite game. I brought me hours upon hours of fun. I couldn't believe how they brought this game back to life and even added a few new campaigns and civilizations. They really did an amazing job. It was alot of fun to play a timeless classic. This was by far microsofts best game in my opinion. The new campaigns weren't perfect but they were alot of fun. I def reccomend to play this game whether you've played it before years ago or for the first time.
"As a teenager, I sunk hours upon hours into the original AoE2 and the Conquerors expansion- it was one of those all-consuming, defining games. When I revisited it later, I was dismayed that it didn't run well under Windows 7.  This HD remake is perfect, it makes the game play on modern machines, has functioning online play with the power of the Steam community behind it, and is just generally a definitive way to paly this absolutely classic game. Highly, highly recommended."
"Played this when I was little, somehow learned to play this game using the hotkeys and made 'X amount of allies vs X amount of Enemies maps.'  Amazing Game, This game may be lacking in most aspects in comparison to todays standards but however still stands, (IMO) , as a timeless shining gem among RTS series.  -All aspects of the game stay true to the disc version. (Unit Pathing,Combat,Mechanics)  Added: -Online Multiplayer thats actually Decent! -DLC -Optimization (Graphics) -Workshop!  -Most cons can be directed toward the limitations of the game during its time. ie: Units getting stuck.. (that's all I could think of..)//   It's not as flashy as other games, but it has its own unique charm, Large Battles and sieges feel real, and require careful planning/execution. A game where you can easily fool around and experiment in if you'd like to! Example; Cavalry Only, Quote the Rohirrim,Die to spears. Historic accuracy everyone!  The Campaigns show some of the real important battles/events during the time period in which they took place. Some campaigns teach new players how things work while others challenge more experienced ones.   I wouldn't be discouraged by price as it usually goes on sale for 75%+ at every sale.  All in all this was a fun game to play as a kid and I still enjoy playing it. However as a final warning,  *This can be very time consuming.*"
"Its a great fun game, though the dlc should just be free updates. Way to greedy, for a game this old. I still like this game though. So many things can be improved."
"Age of Empires was the first game i ever played on PC. If you like games about building communities and taking down other armies, then you will love this!!"
"If you played this game years ago , it'll bring back memoris. Unfortunately it's still got every one of the bugs that you remember as well. When you have an 8 player game, someone always drops. When someone drops the game often glitches and won't continue. Also the players haven't changed either. People still quit as soon as they get attacked.   ~A  Ok changing r eview THe devs DID fix some of the bugs I havent gotten an out of sync in awhile So its getting a good review now :D THere are still problems with the player base but oh well thats all steam games THere's also AOE2lobbycom if you want a better lobby browser"
Good game brings back some good memories.
"  This game is by far the best RTS game of all time. Dispite it's release in 1999, this game has continued to stay alive due to its enless amount of stratagies and game modes. My only issue is that online will sometime have short 3 secound freezes every few minutes and will crawl to a drudge if you are playing with 7 other people and every one has a maxed out army. Overall 10/10 best RTS to exist."
"A classic, do I need to write more?  10/10,"
"A superb game that has thoroughly stood up to the test of time. The gameplay remains just as superb as I remember it from my youth, and is equally as enthralling now as it was then.  I would argue that this is no more HD than the original one is - the animations, even the sprites, feel barely changed from their original resolution in the original AOEII.   Its graphics hence look a little dated, but it should run on 99% of computers at a silky smooth framerate, so grab it if you want a slice of gaming history."
I love this game!!!  All its needs is to be available on MAC!
 10/10 would rush again
very good rts game
It's age of empires. Two thumbs way up.
"In a sentence , history lessons for gamers with much wololo involved."
"Where to begin, I've played Aoe2 since it came out when I was like 10 (can't exactly remember) although my steam says I've played for 31 hours, it's probably more like 3,100, perhaps more.

It's my childhood game and the just the nostalgia is enough for this to be worth it.
amazing playing and having your missus suck you off.
i really enjoyed this game
Best RTS ever.  Still played by thousand of players 15 years after the release. The bad point is that it's very addictive. Try it and you'll never want to play another RTS.
One of my favorite games of all time!
"It's amazing that a 17 year old video game can still keep me enthralled for hours on end. I remember being shown this game at a friends house when I was a teenager, and I was immediately captivated by the medieval setting. I would spend hours in the Scenario maker designing my own medieval lands and the online games I played with my friends were so fun we would talk about it the day after at school. I couldn't wait to get home and play AOE2, again!  I played AOE3 a bit and AOM quit extensively, the latter being a very good game in it's own right, but there's just something about AOE2 that resonates something deep inside me to this day. I didn't know about the HD remake until last year, and when I found it I had to get the game, again! The graphics still hold up, and with hundreds of community mods in the workshop the game has a lot of appeal to almost anyone out there. I'm impressed with the amount of attention Creative Assembly have poured into the game, most notably the new expansions and added units and civilizations, new maps and map sizes, the game really feels twice as much more than it did in the past.  The only thing that irks me about the game, and has done so since day one, are the vast array of units that every civilization shares. There are a few unique units that each civilization has all to their own, but it's still a little off putting seeing an army of European man-at-arms being recruited from a Japanese barracks or swarming the jungles of the Aztecs and Mayans. But that's what AOE2 has always been about, I suppose. It's a small complaint and doesn't take away at all of the true core gaming experience. And with the aforementioned community mods available, a lot of fine folks have alleviated this problem, a bit.   If you're a huge fan of medieval gaming, you may want to check this one out. If you enjoy real time strategy games, well this is one of the most classic examples of the genre and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you passed AOE2 up.  If you can stomach the price for a 17 year old game, it is worth it, but if you're patient enough to wait for it to go on sale it would truly be a steal. It would be most worthwhile to purchase all of the added expansions as well to get the full AOE2 experience. I waited until the Summer Sale because I wanted to also purchase it for my girlfriend, who I am trying to get into the game and although she really doesn't play any games whatsoever, she can't resist just how damn fun this one is, especially playing online, together.   Online is a whole other story. Personally I haven't dabbled too much into online with people I didn't know, as my skills aren't quite up to par to the general level. But I'm starting to be a little more brave and I really don't mind getting my butt handed to me as it's quite a learning experience and still much fun to be had, as long as it doesn't happen too often!  So long story short, if you haven't heard of this game before, get out from under that rock you've been living under and experience one of the most timeless, funnest, most in depth games ever created. And for those who have played the original before but felt they've grown out of it, well be prepared to spend more countless hours falling in love with it all over again, as I have!"
"Very fun game, I enjoyed it for years when I was little and I had long since lost it, so I was super happy to see it come out in HD. The graphics literally made me want to cry out with joy. This game is the perfect mix of nostalgia that I remeber with new added game play."
Got it for the Win 7 support and Multiplayer. It delivered. Wololo b****es
"I played from 10:30 Pm to 3 AM without even realising 2 hours went by, omfg so good now I need to go sleep lel 9/10  -1 cos ill be so f%#*&amp;! tommorow"
"The original AOE II was and still one of my favorite games ever. The only problem was the lag at high population levels. I was hopeful that this iteration would solve that problem, but it didnt. This game is completely unplayable. Dont waste your money."
So glad aoe is back :) I've played all of them before and they're always so fun! and in HD now :o !! how epically wonderful it looks
best oldshool game
"I have been playing Age of Empires II since it\'s first incarnation. I have loved every moment of it.  This game is a fantasy strategy game based on real civilizations in our history. Any culture from the Vikings to the Egyptians, the Mongols to the British. There are many cultures to choose from with their subtle differences.  With the game you get the campaign where you pit your skills against the AI going through different, ‘important’ wars in history. The AI is competitive to the point that it can, if you don’t use your strategies properly, be frustrating. That however isn’t a bad thing. The campaigns won’t leave you disappointed.  The game has multiplayer where you can challenge yourself against other players or the AI which you can set to different difficulties and or team with the AI or other players to win the game. The multiplayer maps are varied and also can support large war games for many cultures.  This game was good when it was released back in the late 90’s and now with it’s HD update it’s even better.  Buy it! Play it! "
This game tickles my special naughty place. 12/10 m8 - IGN
Another classic.
"Best ever (for me) real-time strategy game and it still is among the top of its category, even though its over a decade that has been released. Pioneer of a category !!!"
"Best RTS ive ever played, learning 'how to play' takes 20 minutes, after that its all your own strategy. Great intro to this style of game."
Great classic game- but why can't you do offline multiplayer without steam being connected?
It is fun taking over the world!
"The best rts there ever was, and ever will be."
My favorite RTS of all time! This version is even better than the original! Love the new 500 max population cap especially! The new forgotten campaign is a must-buy as well. So glad to have it retooled and available to play with friends over Steam!
"i remember that i play the original Age of Empires II, and it was very fun and entertaining to play and with the remastered version of Age of Empires II, it was, very amazing, because it was the same game, but better, a little bit better with the graphics, better resolution. im impressed."
"Great game.  Cool to play online with friends or strangers, single player only got better.  I would rate this as a Go out and get it now!"
yesss death match ftw
Muh Childhood is back
Such an old game and still many peoples favorite. number 1 RTS in my books
Turns me on 10/10
Converted a trebuchet to Christianity and it fell apart.  11/10 would pillage again.
"Im playing this game since 2003 and it never gets old, a classic and one of the best RTS games of all time. the HD version needs some fixing but its still really good overall and with the expansions ( campaing sucks but techs and civs are cool ) you expand the game to make it more fun and lets not forget the main reason why i got this game when i have the CD version THE MODS. i downloaded the Donald Trump Taunt pack and everytime i play defense and must build a wall i just type a number and ' WE MUST BUILD A WOLLLLL' GodEmperorTrump/10"
Best (insert any noun here) ever!
Been playing this game pretty much since I've played PC games. Intend to keep playing it.
"As epic as it was years ago, the new HD reboot did not disappoint. Age Of Empires remains, to this day, one of the best real-time strategies on the market, rivalling games such as Star Craft and Supreme Commander. I'd recommend this to any gamer out there, casual or hardcore.  - 9/10"
I played it when i was 7 and i play it now. Same feels &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
"I say one of the best Real time Strategy game ever made in gaming history. In the top 10 list all time, this is in the number 3-4 spot. Very nostalgic game, the classic game is now recaptured in HD with higher resolutions and able to run on windows 7 or higher. This is a very extraordinary Medieval/Renaissance RTS game. Building a city and army by gather resources like FOOD,GOLD,STONE, and WOOD and crush your opponents with an huge medieval army! Age of Empires 2 is the best in the AOE series. It's good how they kept the vintage looks and gameplay of the classic Age of Empires.  Score: 9.5/10"
Do i really need to explain why recommend this game ?
"Collect Berries, Chop wood, Mine Gold, Build and Upgrade, And fight, Repeat. A really awesome RTS. One of Microsofts good games.  7/10"
please play
Update: The review below was only for two days. It's been working fine ever since then. Great game.   Bought the game yesterday. Been able to join ONE multiplayer game out of maybe 20-30. For the rest of the games it just gets stuck at 'Joining multiplayer game...'. Don't buy this game until this issue is fixed.
"AoE II: HD is what a HD remake should be. If you loved AoC, this release gives the classic experience as you remember... with mod support! And online matchmaking! Love it, 10/10."
old but cool

Fun and great game!
Played all the time as a kid. I am glad its on steam now!
Classic strategy game that never gets old. I had played this years back when it was just new and i loved it then and i still do. 
Oh dear........ The AI monk preaches to my wooden battering rams and they have a change of heart and convert to catholicism and turn red...... 8/8 its gr8
"This is my childhood, and im glad that they made it in HD. For me to love this game once more. So if you got 20 bucks and don't know what to be I highly recommend this game."
"Great game for all age groups. You can play with friends or play with bots and still have the same amount of fun. Each class has different selections to build their army from, and has different strengths and weaknesses. You can also adjust the map settings to suit your preferences."
Outstanding game. You must get this otherwise you're missing out.
Great Game.
"This is such a great game. The strategic planning and resource gathering might be slower than some people might be used to in other games like Starcraft, but the HD edition has stunning graphics and incredible replay value. There are so many different civilizations, each with their own special abilities, units, and technologies, and many different maps with different settings, it is definitely worth the money."
"This game is worth buying because it's Age of Empires II, and it's in HD. That, and the Steam Workshop has some amazing stuff like the new textures and music files.  However, it took the developers more than one year to get rid of all the bugs. And yet, some are still there. The achievements, for example, are entirely broken. And so is the Steam Workshop: sometimes I have to re-verify the integrity of the game files because something has gone wrong.  But, other than this, the game is very enjoyable. It's a classic that must be played from every RTS fan out there. If you haven't gotten it yet, now it's the right time."
I got attacked in the first 5 minutes but repeled it with a army of villagers
"This is one of the greatest classical RTS games, first released in 1999. Still being supported and new content being added on a regularly. Game plays like the old era RTS games (note graphics are updated thought), if you don't use the forgotten. Plays like todays RTS if you do use the forgotten. Highly recommended to anyone who loves RTS. Still very popular, and top 50 played Steam games played daily… Play both the old and new eras and you decide which decade is better. Let me know, I believe the old is still holding its own today. "
"Awesome, still playing."
An awesome classic remastered in HD a must buy
"I don't like this game, waste of money. It's the worst game ever ma *wololoooooo* ... OMG THIS GAME IS AWESOME!! 100/100"
11 11 11 11 11
I've played 13 hours games just to lose to friends in a 10 minutes battle.  I regret nothing. Great Game.
At launch it was very buggy and lacked a lot of features. Today it's pretty good and totally worth it if you just want to hop in and play some AoE2 matches every once in a while without having to set up third party stuff.
"So, how do you turn this on?"
"The game is relatively good given its Age of Empires 2. Forgotten Empires adds some cool stuff and a lot of cool new campaigns. The community on the other hand is a mixed barrel; I will personally say I did not have a good time given the inherent elitism this game has brewed over the course of many years in its game communities and the lack of variety in maps that people play;   (and do note that this is not a problem of a lack of maps in the selection list, this is the community im speaking about)   especially on this release of this version of the game; I've gotten sick of teamgames on Black Forest pretty fast.    People either refer to the same old maps and those who don't are normally very good players in terms of skill level, which can be intimidating for anyone who is rusty and returning to the game or completely new. The ELO system also tends to encourage this elitism and can (and I don't blame them because lower ranked players in a game can severely drop elo scores) end up in people getting the boot and not finding good games.   1 vs 1's have also largely died out. The only people who really play lots of them tend to be more experienced players high in their performance, so you will not find a variety of skill levels typically.  Scenario maps exist and you will find a few people hosting the odd game of castle blood and some of the old favourites, but the mapping community is nothing really new when it comes to day to day play. But then again this game has been out for over 15-16 years so go figure.   Overall the game content is good, but while online play exists and there is a modest amount of games about, they are mostly unvaried and to be frank filled with toxic attitudes.  Buy it for the new campaigns and civilization content; if you're looking to rehash your glory days from the zone or find a nice community to play with don't bother."
"A true Classic RTS. It is quite hard, but AI is not overly smart you just have to be prepared against constant attacks. Want a real challenge win a match with 7 AI players allied against you on maptype:plains"
"In my opinion, one of the bests if not the best strategy game ever build. I think that the HD remaster could be better but is faithfull to the original version."
You Should Play This Game Because its Fantastic many many hours of FUN!
Perhaps the best real-time strategy game ever made.
"BEST GAME EVER!!!  The multiplayer is FANTASTIC. You can usually find anyone your skill level to play with. I've seen both 1400- ranks and 2000+ ranks.  They regularly come out with patches to fix known problems in multiplayer.  If you have never played single player, it's highly underrated as well. I got a solid 20 hours of gameplay alone from doing all the single player campaigns."
"Fantastic game but it has some massive frame rate issues on really good pc's. Its a fairly common issue as quite a few friends and people on forums have it, too. Eventually frame rates drop. Still a fantastic game and worth a buy."
really fun and engaging game with a lot of depth and this is an old game. I could spend hours playing and not regret it.
"This game is greatanormous!  Even for a older game, the gameplay is wonderful and you get a new exprience any time you play :)"
"Great remake, makes playing multiplayed seamless :) Nomore hours of figuring out ips and firewalls"
This game is timeless. 10/10
"Screw you metacritic, how dare you give this game a 68."
"Since time immemorial I have been playing the Age of Empires series. It's one of those games I grew up with, and I got witness its rise and fall first hand. Here, the series peaks with Age of Empires II. The games design is near flawless and is one of those truly timeless strategy games. The Steam version includes the original Age of Kings and its expansion pack, The Conquerers. It also adds Steamworks support for mulitplayer games, Workshop support, and a new expansion, The Forgotten.  If you somehow do not own the original game, now is your chance to get it at a decent price. The new expansion is also rather decent. If you already own the original game you should buy this and The Forgotten during a sale."
"If you've already played Age of Empires II, then you already know this game. It's exactly the same as the original, only with improved (or 'HD') graphics.  If you have never played Age of Empires II, I would recommend it if you enjoy RTS games and feel like trying one of the classics. The single player campaigns are long and challenging, and multiplayer is lots of fun. I always enjoyed teaming with several friends against an equal number of computer players, and it's nice that the computer opponents can pretty much be set anywhere from 'nearly impossible to lose against' to 'nearly impossible to beat' and anywhere in between.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles and amazing graphics of the latest RTS games, but it still is a classic game (and should certainly have a MUCH higher Metacritic score...68 is just not right). Recommended to any and all RTS fans."
"Really good game, surprised it has got such a low metascore. Yes its only the original game made to run at today's resolutions, but that does make a big difference to the experience- nothing is streched anymore (I have the original AOE ii and its painful to play on my 1080p screen). Its only £15 too so it is not exactly AAA game price, and I'd say its worth it with steam integration. The forgotten expansion add another elements too. I Recommended it but if you have a older style aspect ratio screen and you still have the original AOEii lying around then I wouldn't bother."
Awesome to play everyone should try it
"This game is a timeless classic real-time strategy war game that keeps you on your toes while you expand, progress and conquer and kick serious butt. Super fun in 1999, super fun today."
"I'm 69 years old.I've played this type of game for 6 years now, but I like this game the most."
still love it after all these years
"AoE II: HD is a re-release and minor graphical update of a circa 2000 RTS, with 18 civilisations to choose from, focuses on the 'dark ages' to the start of the renaissance era. Each civilisation has 1 or 2 unique units and technologies as well as a varied tech tree (all derived from a standardised tree, though). For single player campaigns, it features: William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Barbarossa, Saladin, Genghis Khan, El Cid, Montezuma and Attila the Hun. It also has up to 8 player multiplayer with various game modes such as regicide, death match, king of the hill and defend the wonder. This also includes AI skirmish capability for solo play. In addition, there are also many user created scenarios available to play that can be downloaded from the workshop.  Although at first, this may be thought of as a money-grabbing exercise, this breathes new life into a formerly slowly dying community, allows easier multiplayer without a 3rd party service and has fresh workshop content as well as bringing this old game to a new generation of players.  Although graphically dated, it still has great RTS mechanics and if you want to play a classic RTS with good multiplayer play, this is a game you'll want. Also for those who feel nostalgic and want to play AoE II with support for 'HD' resolutions."
"Nice game, very oldskool!! Too bad the multiplayer still doesn't work very smooth"
I've always loved playing age of empired and now I can do it it HD. A fab game well worth investing in!
"At this point I need to keep honest with potentional buyers of this game. Let me be clear: at this point, don't buy the game. Too much crashing games molest our game experience these days. It's almost unplayable and every game you're just waiting till it crashes. The crashes may happen early/mid/late game and the developers have not yet found the cause. Till this problem has not been fixed do not buy it!  Also note: this game has a real high step-in level. The majority of the players here learned this game in around 2000, like myself. I remember playing this with my dad when I was 5 yrs old. It's nostalgic and that is what makes it still played by many. However, you can find noob lobbies where the avarage level is pretty bad. But when you do not know the ''way'' of playing you won't be having great fun. I recommend you to read information and how-to guides to get the most out of this game. If you train your skills in this game (micro &amp; macro) you'll be having a great time since it is a timeless game. Every game is different and it doesn't require much space on your PC so you can have it anywhere installed.  I have played this game over 1000+ hours and it never gets boring. But I also recommend you to play this with online friends. To complete the fun, use communication through microphone.  If you want to learn it fast google for the aoe2 forums &amp; wiki's. Also read the guides &amp; watch the streams on twitch (those pro games casted by membrillo are really fun to watch).  Pro's: + Great nostalgic game + Perfectly balanced civs + Never ending fun + Every decent PC can handle it + Enough ppl that want to play it online + Good community (mostly) + Workshop items (custom maps &amp; scenarios) Cons: - Recently bad updates &amp; crashes (but I am sure they get fixed someday) - Some people can't handle this game (I have no idea how), they manage to lag cause of bad internet or have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC which can't handle the game (how the hell can't your pc handle this game?).  - Those people that lag can ruin a complete game and then you'll have a bad experience. I recommend you to play with mostly people living in nearby countries (for example: I try to play with Europeans only) - You can't blacklist players (Trolls &amp; smurfs for eg.) "
This game is really fun and even more so with mods. All that I need from this game now is people to play it with. (Only Get it On Sale)
This would have to be my alltime favorite game. Its one of those games that never gets old. You can play it for hours some days then don't play it for a year and know that the next time you try it you will be hooked again. Age of Kings was my fav expansion and I love playing with the Turks - who doesn't like a little gun power in the Castle Age :-) Its a great game to play single player with the missions and/or a comp stomp or with your friends. Never gets boring! I was so happy to see them continue to update the game with new expansions.
I remember this game from my childhood. I loved working on the economy and then destroying everyone in succession. Buy this game if you like real time stratagy games that are easy to get to grip with.
Video game farming has never been so fun.  Wololololo/10
do it and get many dlc
"This game is fun if you have time to blow. I think its the best playing with your friends. Unless you are looking for competitive play, I say you should just play this with your friends. You basically learn to play 26 different civilizations and build up from the dark ages into the imperial ages where gunpowder first comes into play. There are many different maps and many different combanations of gameplay. If you are looking for a great time killer with tons of enjoyment, then you should play this. If you really want to, they have a map editor where you can well make a map and play this game in a very unbalanced matter that you planned out. BUY IT, ENJOY IT, AND ALWAYS PLAY IT :p "
"It's Age of Empires FFS, what are you waiting for? The world's greatest WOLOLO simulator is now on Steam."
"Awesome game, I recommend you buy this (especially the 4 pack) because it is better with Friends, this game is a great remake of the first version of it, again I highly reccomend this game, if you don't like it, I won't hate you for it, it is your opinion anyways."
"Amazing, timeless RTS classic!"
Multiplayer is almost completely broken. Games frequently fail to start. When they do they're usually laggy. Players drop often even after the game starts.
Best classic game of all time!
10/10 would wololo and choppa again
"I used to play it in Win 98, my very first computer game. Old but Gold!"
Classic game.. still good.. just wish there were higher skilled players that still enjoyed competitive play
Although the price is a bit much! Playing a great game which once again has a great online community is what makes it worth it over the 'High Definition' graphics.
Never would of consiterd this game... untill I tryed it
"I never played this game until the HD release was available, so I can't really compare the two, but I can say that this is a wonderfully entertaining and highly addictive strategy game! I've only had it for a few days but it is really simple to get the hang of (thanks to the fun and helpful tutorials), not really frustrating as the AI are quite independant and you don't really have to micromanage every ounce of activity they do. Go and make a few villagers build a lumbermill and they will chop down forests aferwards. The whole building up your empire is satisfying in its own right. Most of my time is spent doing this rather than going into battle. The few battles I've participated in so far have been fun though. I've also heard about a lot of issues with multiplayer, and so far I've only played online with my fiance sitting in the same room with NO problems whatsoever.  Very few negative points so far, I can't even think of any right now. Highly recommended! 9/10"
"Game was awesome in 1999 Game still awesome in 2014 One of the best RTS games in my opinion, even modern games can't top the fun I had back then and yesterday morning spamming '30' in the chat.  You Only Convert Once  Wololo  11/10  "
"I used to play this game for days with my friends years ago. Now it's back with a vengeance. I can't see any difference in the graphics, but you can see more and increase the unit cap further. They must have thrown efficiency out the window when making this because it slowed to an unplayable crawl on my 5 year old laptop even with a unit cap of 200, but it runs like a dream on my good computer. All in all, not a significant improvement over the original game, but totally worth the price to play on modern computers, since the original game hasn't worked since XP. The new expansion pack also looks interesting, and I'm seriously considering getting it.  8/10"
It's fun to sit down with some friends and play a round.
"Pretty good RTS game, no real balance issue whatsoever as far as I can tell, very good randomnly generated maps that MOST of the time don't give any noticeable advantage to anyone. However, I definitely would have expected more of an HD version. The graphics haven't changed that much at all. Having said that, the game supports steam workshop and there are plenty of community-made upgrades to graphics and they added new content as DLC which adds some depth to the rather old original title as well as featuring an online option (the old version also did but they stopped supporting it a very long time ago) On the other hand I think the game does lack some variety due to the fact that there isn't an awful lot of differences between all the different playable empires but this is only my opinion, one might argue that there actually is variety because of the unique units and upgrades of each empires and they wouldn't really be wrong in that regard. There is an arguably big learning curve but RTS players will probably notice that it isn't as big of a deal as other more complicated games of the same genre.  Overall pretty solid at what it does, would definitely recommand to people interested in a new RTS or fans of the original AOE2 that feel a sudden wave of nostalgia."
"So it's an old game, but it's one I still consider a classic nontheless. The AI is a bit wonky, and you have a few things that don't make sense (Aztecs using two handed swords and plate mail) but nobody ever said it was perfect, it's just fun. Build up a civ, keep an economy going, kill your enemy. Pretty decent strategy game all things considered."
This is a great game filled with nostalgia. Age of Empires II is just as good now as it was when it was released.
if you enjoy making ♥♥♥♥ marks on your seat from excessive sitting sessions this game is for you.
"played this game when i was five, still have 5 disk of this game and so i bought it on steam. One of my favorite games of all times!!! definitely a great pick up to play with or against your friends."
Love to see this old game come back to life with some new features. i beliave their should be some work done with multiplaying hosting games and things just with lags and servers and stuff to reduce glitching and dropping of other people.
It's a classic.
"Age of Empires is undoubtedly best game in history of mankind, thats why I am so dissapointed that I suck at it and get beaten up by AI. Well, considering the fact that chess world champion got beaten up in chess by AI as early as 1997 I shouldn't be so upset, guess I'll try again..  .. *30minutes later*   Somehow AI converted my catapults to Islam!  Can't even imagine what would happen if Islamic State would convert our nuclear warheads to Islam.  Guess warfare is not for me, I'll just enjoy exploring map with my sheep."
best game 10/10 never felt so good winning against bots
collect the most rc sheep and bring them to your base unharmed to win the game   sheep/10
Empires rise! Empires fall!  But you remain.  Now in HD !   10/10 nostalgia!
Great game. It makes you think and it is a great strategy game.
"This game is a relic of the old glory days of RTS games. Even though it's outdated in all aspects, it still delivers great enjoyment. Moreover the game brings back memories of childhood. The only down side is that the game and its DLC are too overpriced. But all in all, it's a must get, especially if you had played the original version."
3 of Britons Longbowman Armies and your done for the game. 10/10 wood please
"One of the best RTS games ever. Now, let's just get it ported to Linux so we can play it on Steam machines!"
I love it! Classic AOE2 in HD and fixed the downside of MSN online (which nobody played) by using steam servers. Great to play and make maps with your friends and just good all around. 10/10
"1 OF THE BEST CLASSIC RTS GAMES! IT'S THE SAME AS AGE OF EMPIRES II, IT JUST HAS BETTER GRAPHICS!"
"10/10 loaded up once, but now doesnt run  wolololo tho amirite?"
"Best RTS of all time, if you love strategy games, buy it!"
Game crashed when I tried to build a house in the tutorial  Ten adda ten truly a masterpiece of a HD remake
"Age of Empires is a great game, as you can either play as the same civilization as a friend, as allies, or as enemies. You can create your own maps, to make yourself as OP as possible, and you can even alter the map so that you can control the field. In other words, you can either win fair or win fast."
buy this game and thats all i have to say
"Age of Empires II HD delivers what it promises, and stays at that.  +10 points for delivering a game that fulfills what the trailer offers. +30 points for the music +15 points for the gameplay +30 points for context (story/comedy/characters)  85 points that don´t mean anything but still you gotta check up this game if you´re into the RTS genre.  The only drawback of this game is that macromanagement (relying on the I.A for orders like follow and protect, even attack on sight) will be very frustrating on some circumstances."
"AoE II: HD is what a HD remake should be. If you loved AoC, this release gives the classic experience as you remember... with mod support! And online matchmaking! Love it, 10/10."
I passed my history exam because i played the story mode
I don't really like this- WOLOLO I love this game!!
I've play this game when it came out a long time ago on PC and im still playing to this day.
"don`t look at the metascore and think this game is bad, because it`s actully a really great game!"
"Firstly, the metascore for this game (For those who care) is misleading. The game as you remember it is quite well intact, and good as ever it was. However, the transition to Steam and 'HD' is very underwhelming. It offers very little that makes it worth its price tag should you already own it (And cetain 'Expansions' from elsewhere) and what is does offer is often disappointing. The HD, while nice, is almost unoticeable from the original. The online play, which I would venture many desire from this, is unimpresive and fickle to work with. Steam Workshop so far does not seem to add much to the game either, aside to make minute changes, the return a lot of the smaller HD changes to their previous form. Strangely, AoE suffers from problems that you would think extinct in this age. There are issues with it no properly accessing multople CPU cores, causing clientside lag, and issues with connectivity causing Desyncs and connection lag.   In summary, the game itself is about as fine as it ever has been, and its expansion is enjoyable, but unless you suffer compatibility issues you can't be bothered to or otherwise lack the capacity to figure out (Like myself) you would be better off with the original. If you are simply looking for a way to bring AoE to the Steam community and play with friends then yes it does that and I recommend it for you."
"It's an old classic which has been reintroduced for multiplayer capabilities over steam. It has not changed any gameplay mechanics (for the most part), nor has the graphics been modernized. It remains as the nostalgic - king of the ages, Age of Kings, game.  I have not really experienced the Single Player aspect, but I suspect that gameplay would flow as smoothly, if not smoother, than multiplayer.  For multiplayer, I have only played with friends, and the pings can be somewhat ridiculous - instead of the typical ~50ms, we sometimes connect to each other with ~300ms. However this is managable and you barely notice it once the game begins.  The only downside is multiplayer with AI. The AI can create major lag issues, causing periodic pauses, ruining the climax of a game. Players end up going out of sync with one another, and cussing ensues.   Overall, with a few bugs to fix up as time goes by, this is the typical Age of Empires II, which should take no time in readjusting to if you've played it pre-steam.  Rating - 9/10  "
"WOLOLO  The game is good if you have a few hours to kill (e.g. long flights or just laying in bed), but bad if you have a time schedule to stick to. 10/10 would play again"
I think this is the best strategy old school game since 1999. If you want take a break this is the game!   It's a must have if you like strategy games.
"'Wololoooo!' Thats is what you will get! Remember AOE II when it came out? Well, this is the absolute same awesome game! Only difference is: It's widescreen!  So come one, come ye all, get in a pvp and then blame it on your ISP!  HOUZAAA!!!!"
This game is th3 53x
Cool game. The gameplay is nice and smooth and indeed better quality than the original. Multiplayer is a bit bad though. Steam should be hosting servers.
"Its awesome, also i want the achievement"

It's okay I guess.
I got rekt by online players - 10/10
"This is going to take me Aegis. Robin Hood,Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Lumberjack, Rock on, Rock on,Rock on,Cheese Steak Jimmy's. Now i can start the game, but how do you turn this on?"
The game where u can beat any empire with a big ♥♥♥ with just a monk that collects relics. INSTA GG  10/10 would go Monk only again
"Best game I have ever played.  I put just about 32 hours on it in the first 2 days of buying it. I haven't seen the sun in weeks and my friends think I'm dead. My body has adapted to where I can receive energy from the lightbulbs in my room, almost like photosynthesis. I have received approximately 4 hemorrhoids in the last week because the only time I leave my seat is when I reset my router. I can't sleep at night anymore because everytime I shut my eyes I hear my town center's bell ringing in my head. But other than that this is a great game. 10/10"
"A very fun strategy game, especially when you have tons of friends to play with :D"
"Made everything function better and more shiny, all without ruining the original at all."
"When I'm losing I like to spam endless layers of walls so that it takes the enemy 4 hours to break through so they quit instead and I win. one time I walled my own ally's town centre in and they couldn't play so they resigned and everyone else resigned too so I won.  It's a semi-decent game, 10/10"
"I am a cosnole gamer and I play as many pc games as possible. Age of empires is one of them.I always wanted to play this game!  It's a really smart game.You have to think which will be your next move .Doing something wrong could be a diasaster. There are not many games like age of empires and that's why I believe every gamer should play this one! 8,5/10"
OMG! These graphics are amazeballs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
+1
You can win history by building a building.  10/10
Best RTS I've ever played. I would definitely like getting into the newer RTS's but they simply don't compete in my eyes to the classic version of AOE II.
Wololo
"This convertion of AoE is something that we were waiting for a couple of years (since 2007 more or less). Although it's very appreciated that they included Workshop on it, this 'HD' version leaves much to be desired, mostly because it doesn't add a lot of content to the game, it is just limited to certain features, like the bigger resolutions, somewhat improved water and the fact that you can play online without having to use Hamachi or similar software. I will give it a 5.9/10, because it falls a bit short of a passing score for me. At least the community has grown and we're seeing a lot of new content being added everyday, so if we add that to the equation we have a 6.50/10 game."
"This game is nostalgia for a good price. The music is a little different, but the feeling is still there. With the Steam achievements to go with it, Age of Empires II is a lot more entertaining than it used to be. I highly recommend it for those who played it when it first came out thirteen years ago."
All i can say is that you have to play this game it is so epic...  Everything is good if you do not know nothing about this game it is simple...  this game have campaign that you need to advance to finish the game and have a standard game...  storyline is good and epic. Standard game... You play against computer or other players and try to win the game.  this game you start with a building called by Town Center that you can generate people and start to building stuff...  you can build armies and put down the other teams to conquer the map!  amazing that is all i can tell!
  Age of Empires II HD review
"its hard for me to stop playing this, ive seen a lot of strategy games, but this series has to take the cake! 9.5/10 in my book"
"If you are here and just got into PC world, I suggest you get this game right now. This game is the memory of the past that will herald your experience in the future."
"I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game growing up , and I jumped at the chance to get it so I can play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it now. Definitely worth the daily deal price, and I'm pretty excited to see what the DLC has to offer, as well as the community maps/campaigns. Mega replayability for random maps and campaigns, super easy to develop your own play style, and god, the graphics and music nostalgia..."
"Re-worked, Online Multiplayer, 1080p+, tons of fun, childhood reborn. Must get!"
"Growing up as a kid with Windows 98 computer and no internet, I played this game for days at a time. Does this HD Steam Version hold up? Immensely Do I recommend it? Absolutely  Pick it up sometime on a sale and try it yourself."
Great game!!!
"The walls are amazing, the only reason I play is to make trump proud with my wall. #Latinosfortrump"
I created a monk army and I converted the enemy's elephants to christianity. 11/10 would wolololo again.
"Dear Britons,   We have a shortage of gold, but plenty of wood. This means that we don't have enough women to go around.   As such, we are hereby forced to come over and steal your gold, and then use our wood on your women.   Sorry, The Mongols"
"Seriously?  Literally had this game for less than 24 hours. Was working just fine about 3 hours ago opened it now and it doesn't work... Would still recommend it just because it's probably one of the best games from it's genre, but can someone who's able to help me contact me via my steam account? Just message me. Sorry I had to post it here couldn't find any forums."
"For those having problems with multiplayer. Try not to save while in the middle of a multiplayer game. It sometimes causes the game to desync. Also, it seems impossible to load a multiplayer save file."
I rate this game 10/10. Best strategy game ever.
"Its a great classic, voice acting for the campaign is great too, 3 could be better but its personal preference and taste."
There will never be a better game than this. It's fun to play as a beginner and then it just grows. Best RTS ever made. The only negative thing is that new players online start with 1600 ELO (ranking) and that is very high so prepare to lose and lower your elo if you are a new player. This game will never die.
Its a classic yo.
"A great game  Literally everything could be improved in AoE2, but then again the game is extremely old and I don't have any expectations of that.  Sad to see that there are no Age Of Empires games released to mimic the classic feel of the original trilogy."
build some ♥♥♥♥
Geat game fun to play thats all just a great game
"Fat king on foot outspeeds cavalry. Villagers attack with knives, despite hunting with bows. Aztecs vs. Huns in Texas. Light cavalry costs food only, even to make its sword and armour. Buildings and siege weapons have religous persuasions and thus can be converted. Most buildings clearly made out of stone but cost wood.  8/8 m8, would recommend.  How do you turn this on?"
This game is a great war simulator the graphics are okay but look a bit stale and are not upto todays standards but what do you expect from a game that came out in 2001. The HD version dosent change the graphics at all but you dont judge a game on its graphics. Its a good game for its time and im glad its been released on steam.
"One of the best and most in-depth strategy games I've ever played. Graphics are not modern-day but the style is beautiful and fits the game well. I love to get together and start a game with friends to battle to the death; every second keeps you on your toes. For every measure you take, there is a counter-measure to it so knowing what your enemy has is a HUGE part of the game, making scouting important. One feature not in the game is making bridges over small land gaps, which I thought would be a feature because of in-game screenshots, but this game has constant updates which might add that sooner or later. My Rating 9/11, Would play again"
"Yeah I'm Addicted, But damn this game is fun. Fan of History? BUY! Fan of RTS BUY (Best on the market)   Pros - Up to 30+ Hours of Campaign (Matters how good you are) - Active community  - New AI  - New DLC The Forgotten including Nations like the Magyars, Slavs, Indians and Italians - Easily makeable Mods and scenarios (Anythings possible) - New Graphics (Hint HD) - Nostalgia trip - Great Pathing - Wololo - ADDICTING!  Cons - Outdated Graphics (90s) - People will kick your casual ♥♥♥ in Multiplayer  10/10"
"So it's an old game, but it's one I still consider a classic nontheless. The AI is a bit wonky, and you have a few things that don't make sense (Aztecs using two handed swords and plate mail) but nobody ever said it was perfect, it's just fun. Build up a civ, keep an economy going, kill your enemy. Pretty decent strategy game all things considered."
Outstanding game. The father of modern strategy games (alongside Warcraft and Starcraft)
All in all this is probably one of thee most fun games i have ever played. For an old school RTS game this is very very well done game. 12/10 would play again !
A very good strategy game. If you like strategy and(a lot of) pressure I'd suggest buying it.
awsome game
I was moist the whole time
"This game is very good, it makes me so happy that i go home everyday ,coat myself in butter and pretend im snail, eating leaves and ooching around the floor"
what does this game have? Petards=ISIS Monks that carries relic that bigger then them Hand cannoneer=Mlg No Scope Onager that kill your teammate too Finnaly WOLOLO
I'm not good at this game unless I play on my Win 2k machine.
-starts game -builds epic army -gets completely destroyed -one villager lives -builds empire again -wrecks everyone  10/10 would get rekt again
"A must have for players who love strategy games. If not, you atleast have to give it a try."
"This is incredibly fun, even for its age. I definitely reccomend this game."
The African Kingdoms expansion brings a new life to AOE II. Highly Recommended Purchase.
"Oldies but goldies! Great RTS game, great multiplayer and single player experience. Get some of your friends and have fun together."
"Eventhough it was released more than a decade ago, Age of Empires 2 (Or AOE 2 for short) is the best RTS you can buy on Steam today. It is the father of all RTS you see today. Its better than its successor Age of Empires 3. If you are a fan of RTS or Strategy in general, give this a try. You will not regret it.  Some pros and cons:  Pros: -Many Great Civs. All balanced and all can counter each other -Campaigns based on real Genrals/Emperors -Smooth Combat -Many types of combat units. It offers a huge diversity of playstyle -Active modding community -Multiplayer with friends/random people online  Cons: -Graphics might be outdated for some. But for me its not -Nothing Else!  Overall: Just buy it and get set for atleast 1000-2000 hrs. Or even more! I had this game as a cd before is steam release. And spent 1000+Hrs onn it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do"
One of the greatest game of all times
"Good old AoE 2, but it's working on widescreen without doubtful patches. Graphics is quite better and it's with expansions. I think everybody, who loved playing it, would buy it and appreciate it."
"great game, poor servers ping thou, which for this game is the most important. till they sort this out id rate it 4/10"
"Fun game, especially with friends but it sucks that it always crashes when our games last around an hour or two (At least from our experiences)."
"Great game, Classic RTS at it's finest. Good for non serious players, and hardcore one's alike. Not sure if the dlc is entirely worth it, but I love the series, and was happy for an addition to my favourite(even with the issues). The game does have a Shared Civ option which I like(similar to Team Melee from SC). Worth the 5-10$ its asking on the steam sale, easily."
"This game really brings back memories from back in the days. It really stands up to the tests of time, and mocks it right in the face.  I haven't played the Steam version much yet, but I do have a lot of time consumed on the original version from the past. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to play a strategy game that has more than just 2-3 factions :D"
Just buy it. It's not just the nostalgia! It is a good game. 
"Age of Empires II... I have been playing this game for 10 years. And still, it gives me thrill, excitemenet and enjoyment like my first play. The game is still well balanced. I think almost all my peers knows this game. I will totaly recommend this game. If you're still thinking to buy this game or not though you love strategical games; why are you still hesitating! Take up arms, create some villagers and build your first castle!  Note: Why metacritic gave this game 68/100 point? Isn't it a little low?"
"tl;dr 8/10; this is as good as the original, but DLC is really what makes it, though it's a bit overpriced, so get it on sale.  A classic RTS resurrected, this is a good buy. I say good in order to avoid 'excellent', because to be honest with the standard the game is as the title says: an HD version of AoE2.  Because of that, it's got the same features as the original game just in HD. The HD is good, but is best seen on things like water and fire. Units are all the same, no changes here. Pluses though are the inclusion of the Workshop and hosting the servers on Steam, as I know it's hard to find matches for the original version. The inclusion of achievments as well is a plus for those into that thing, as well as trading cards.  The Forgotten is really where this version shines though. The inclusion of new campaigns and civilizations are great, as well as the new techs in the Castle Age. They went a bit wild with the renaming of units and making some new ones (like a seemingly pointless AoE1 Broad Swordsman and 'Nordic' and 'Eastern' Swordsmen), but I digress. Campaigns have no narmy VAs sadly but are fun nonetheless with okay storyelling.  The Encylcopedia was expanded for The Forgotten civs. Sadly this meant that the standard HD edition's encyclopedia is messed up. You can interchange between both the Forgotten and HD edition instantly though. However a problem occurs with how faction changes and patches don't carry over between the two, though this only really affects Campaigns (if you have Forgotten you can just play the same civs in MP with the changes). So low pop limits, old tech trees, and stuff still occur in the original campaigns. Another problem I have is the price tag of $29.99. It's a bit too much for a re-release in my opinion, since you can pick up the original version (including Conquerors) for at most $10 somewhere else. The Forgotten DLC is $14.99 as well so my suggestion is just get both on sale if you're going to get it at all.  The game's great as the original though and the Forgotten is fun. I still recommend this game to anyone who wants to play this great game once more. I know I play it regularly, and I have more reason to with this on Steam."
"Why does one still play a game from 2000? Nostalgia. Spending the summer of 2001 playing this game in LAN competition in the TCA computer lab imprinted a memory that is difficult to extirpate. If you played it before, buy it on sell. I bought this game so many times in my life that I should be awarded life long access from Microsoft to all its incarnations."
I don't know why people are not recommending this. This HD release is a blast.  I haven't been able to play my Conqueror's disk in about 6 years due to incompatibility and crash issues. This release solves all of that. I'm more than happy to shell our $20 for a re-release of a game that actually runs on modern computers.
This game takes me back to the good old days and is really fun to play. Although i've had trouble with controling AI this game is forever my favorite.  8/10
I'm good at it
best game on earth mate shoutout to bethesda and all of you guys tryin to make good games. but youll never be able to beat my aoe! 
Really good map designing and technology system with all the civalizations in this game. Really love the multiplayer aspect of the game as well.  I just wish I was better at this game.....
NIce reboot of a classic.
please play this game with us
"10,000 battles? Don't expect to get all the achievements."
"A game from my childhood that holds a special place in my heart, and it still stands up today! Wolololololo. Want to convert your enemy to your own? You can do it. Want to crush your opponents with a horde of elephants. Yep. If you get stuck you can always spawn a demon car."
7/10
"I definitely recommend this game! Great fun to play, especially with friends. Unique style and very nice to play with a lot of friends, so the whole game becomes a team-play based one! Worth buying on sale."
"I used to play this when I was younger, I loved it then and I still love it now!"
"Fantastic overhaul of a time tried and good game. Not a ton of 'new' here other than the mind-crushingly hard Computer opponents (which are fantastic btw).  The game itself is the same core experience you've known and loved for years, with a great new graphics update and of course online steam support and ranked ladders. Glad I purchased.  10/10."
"Reasons to buy this game: - You can convert a trebuchet - Stone walls catch fire if you hit them with swords - 10 camels fit in a boat, 11 people don't - 1 sheep equals 100 steaks - 30 people can chop up a sheep simultaneously - You can walk on water, but only if it's a little green 11/11, would wololo again"
"It is one of the best strategy games that ever existed . Is not expensive and you can have so much fun playing it with friends and other people . It also teach you about history , the history of many empires and things like this ."
"class,brings back memories :)"
This has been one of my favorite games for a long time. Game is just as good as it was 10 years ago.
It's a great remastered classic with improved graphics and the entertainment of the original series. Even though its an old game it's still lots of fun to play and better with friends.
Over 10 years old and still amazing
"Great game if you played it in your childhood and are looking for nostalgia or even if you've never played before but be careful if you buy it. There are still several issues that are slowly, very slowly getting fixed via patches that are considerably spaced out.   Edit 5/12/14: I've had this game since the day it came out, and in the past year and a month, the developers have made significant improvements to this game. One such being an actual attack move command, and various other things such as bug fixes. They released an expansion to the game, as well as many free campaigns. One of the best things about this game is the Steam Workshop which adds many useful mods or user-made campaigns and scenarios. I would still recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale. There have been many sales in which AoEHD2 is $5, and with the expansion is $7.50 or somewhere around that price. Definitely worth waiting until this Summer for the sales, rather than spending $30-35 dollars in my opinion."
"16 years later and still one of the best games I've ever played. Excellent for anyone that enjoys strategy. The scenario editor also allows for incredibly interesting player made maps. Game seems to crash occasionally at the start of matches, however it almost never has issues during a match unless it's client-side lag. Great price too when it's on sale. 9/10 would recommend"
"Great game to play with friends, solo campain ain't too bad ether.  All the civilisations have their ups and downs too making them all fairly balanced.  There are some minor issues in multiplayer regarding connections but other than that its fun.  10/10 would Wololo again :P"
"AoE2 has aged like choice wine, as have the decisions of its developers.  It really is HD, sort of. Textures are improved, AI has received a do-over and the game mechanics have undergone a few tweaks. Technologies have been fine-tuned (free cartography) unique units are worth purchasing (elite eagle warriors) and team bonuses have a quieter influence on gameplay. As a veteran player, you might have remembered there was that one stupid civ that nobody or anybody could play, but I'd invite you to test your theory once more.  Quick fix that took me almost an hour to resolve: If you're stuck on the new hotkey setup that comes with The Forgotten, switch back to Conquerors (up top on the main menu), navigate to hotkey settings and restore the defaults. This lets you play the game with the traditional key bindings. Newer players might want to learn with Forgotten setup, which feels slightly more intuitive than what I'm used to.  If you're also looking to play the Forgotten, I can't recommend a better resource than Resonance22's videos. Check him out on YouTube.  TL;DR: 50 years from now, you'll find me in Shady Oaks retirement home with my laptop. Bring some lemonade."
This is the best game I've played so far.
"Walk in, see this, wat do?  Play Teuton. Kill enemies. ♥♥♥♥ was cash."
My dad used to play this game when I was in high school. It looked cool so I sneaked in and played. It turned out to be more educational than my history classes as I learnt about Joan of Arc and others. It was also better than my english classes since that's where I got a good though outdated vocabulary. I never understood what Wololo is supposed to mean though. Especially when monks try to convert each other.  'Wololo You wololo me? I wololo you. Wololo  Wololo wololo wololo...'  My brain is fried. 10/10 Would recommend.
"Age of Empires is a great game, as you can either play as the same civilization as a friend, as allies, or as enemies. You can create your own maps, to make yourself as OP as possible, and you can even alter the map so that you can control the field. In other words, you can either win fair or win fast."
buy this game and thats all i have to say
"Age of Empires II HD delivers what it promises, and stays at that.  +10 points for delivering a game that fulfills what the trailer offers. +30 points for the music +15 points for the gameplay +30 points for context (story/comedy/characters)  85 points that don´t mean anything but still you gotta check up this game if you´re into the RTS genre.  The only drawback of this game is that macromanagement (relying on the I.A for orders like follow and protect, even attack on sight) will be very frustrating on some circumstances."
I passed my history exam because i played the story mode
"Age of Empires 2 HD is simply put just great. For all the people who have been playing this game when it was just released in 1999 this is a real nostalgic bomb. The game works as smooth as it always has been which feels really good. The graphics however in this HD version aren't that different from the original ones. As a matter of fact , I didn't see any changes at all.   But due to the workshop tool on the game you can download mods really quick. Mods suchs as graphic enhancements and new units and buildings. If you get those mods the game will look much much better.  Still really fun to play. I recommend the game for a price 15 euro or below."
"&lt;3 this game, only it costs some time to finish a level but that is okay"
"Classic game remade brilliantly, I would play this with anyone."
"This game has made me laugh, cry and masturbate, sometimes all at the same time. 10/10 would recommend."
Its gud I love it
I love love LOVE this game!! Haha id tap this game if it was a real life female! step 3: ????? Step 4:romance and profit!??
"Best RTS I've ever played, hands down."
Age of empires II HD looks very similar to Age of empires II. The gameplay is the same. I really liked Age of empires II too. there are some minor tweaks to Age of Empires II HD like a higher population limit. There is just one downside. There is no lan option. I really like playing lan with friends.
Wonderful game.
"Best game I have ever played.  I put just about 32 hours on it in the first 2 days of buying it. I haven't seen the sun in weeks and my friends think I'm dead. My body has adapted to where I can receive energy from the lightbulbs in my room, almost like photosynthesis. I have received approximately 4 hemorrhoids in the last week because the only time I leave my seat is when I reset my router. I can't sleep at night anymore because everytime I shut my eyes I hear my town center's bell ringing in my head. But other than that this is a great game. 10/10"
"Made a monk army, and changed the world"
"One of the games that has aged the best, ever. Despite being so old, this game still remains as good as ever. HD edition just adds more awesomeness to an already amazing game. Newer updates have made the game very stable on steam and have decently patched up the age old problems of lag and bad multiplayer experience, leading to a very smooth online experience for this game. With a really large online community for this game, it's not short on players at all.  I highly recommend this game for being such a classic and deep game that has endless replay value, and such a wide variety of playing styles and game modes that it simply never runs out. 10/10. "
"An amazing remake to the original series. However, the major changes are to the game's engine, the graphics, and the soundtrack. And let me just say, all of the listed above are improved vastly. AI is a bit more intelligent and animations are great. One of my personal favorite parts is the soundtrack! More often than not my friends and I would be humming the tune playing for all of us in synch which was a great addition and remains one of my all time favorite game soundtracks. The graphical touch ups are phenomenal as well. Fires, explosions, and projectiles all look great in comparison to the original AoEII. Everything else is pretty much the same with the game, but now includes Steam Workshop and more modding capabilities.   AoEII HD Edition is like rediscovering your old bicycle, riding it, and finding the ride is just as smoothe as you remember it."
I've always loved playing age of empired and now I can do it it HD. A fab game well worth investing in!
"At this point I need to keep honest with potentional buyers of this game. Let me be clear: at this point, don't buy the game. Too much crashing games molest our game experience these days. It's almost unplayable and every game you're just waiting till it crashes. The crashes may happen early/mid/late game and the developers have not yet found the cause. Till this problem has not been fixed do not buy it!  Also note: this game has a real high step-in level. The majority of the players here learned this game in around 2000, like myself. I remember playing this with my dad when I was 5 yrs old. It's nostalgic and that is what makes it still played by many. However, you can find noob lobbies where the avarage level is pretty bad. But when you do not know the ''way'' of playing you won't be having great fun. I recommend you to read information and how-to guides to get the most out of this game. If you train your skills in this game (micro &amp; macro) you'll be having a great time since it is a timeless game. Every game is different and it doesn't require much space on your PC so you can have it anywhere installed.  I have played this game over 1000+ hours and it never gets boring. But I also recommend you to play this with online friends. To complete the fun, use communication through microphone.  If you want to learn it fast google for the aoe2 forums &amp; wiki's. Also read the guides &amp; watch the streams on twitch (those pro games casted by membrillo are really fun to watch).  Pro's: + Great nostalgic game + Perfectly balanced civs + Never ending fun + Every decent PC can handle it + Enough ppl that want to play it online + Good community (mostly) + Workshop items (custom maps &amp; scenarios) Cons: - Recently bad updates &amp; crashes (but I am sure they get fixed someday) - Some people can't handle this game (I have no idea how), they manage to lag cause of bad internet or have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC which can't handle the game (how the hell can't your pc handle this game?).  - Those people that lag can ruin a complete game and then you'll have a bad experience. I recommend you to play with mostly people living in nearby countries (for example: I try to play with Europeans only) - You can't blacklist players (Trolls &amp; smurfs for eg.) "
Best classic game of all time!
10/10 would wololo and choppa again
"I used to play it in Win 98, my very first computer game. Old but Gold!"
Classic game.. still good.. just wish there were higher skilled players that still enjoyed competitive play
Although the price is a bit much! Playing a great game which once again has a great online community is what makes it worth it over the 'High Definition' graphics.
"Got not enough words to decribe how great this game is. Even though it is old, it could be released today and sold out tommorow"
You know you want to...
Good game sahn get it or quit ya know wut im sayin'
"It's an old classic which has been reintroduced for multiplayer capabilities over steam. It has not changed any gameplay mechanics (for the most part), nor has the graphics been modernized. It remains as the nostalgic - king of the ages, Age of Kings, game.  I have not really experienced the Single Player aspect, but I suspect that gameplay would flow as smoothly, if not smoother, than multiplayer.  For multiplayer, I have only played with friends, and the pings can be somewhat ridiculous - instead of the typical ~50ms, we sometimes connect to each other with ~300ms. However this is managable and you barely notice it once the game begins.  The only downside is multiplayer with AI. The AI can create major lag issues, causing periodic pauses, ruining the climax of a game. Players end up going out of sync with one another, and cussing ensues.   Overall, with a few bugs to fix up as time goes by, this is the typical Age of Empires II, which should take no time in readjusting to if you've played it pre-steam.  Rating - 9/10  "
"Amazing, timeless RTS classic!"
It's fun to sit down with some friends and play a round.
"This is a revamp of Age of Empires II, one of my favourite games of all time. As a fan of the series, I am extremely happy with what they have done to the game. It includes new civilisations, and along with that comes new campaigns and units.   Everything about the game has had general tweaking, and the graphics have become significantly smoother. The new AI is another thing which has undergone some changes. They are now much more like a real human opponent, with several tactics I noticed such as guarding trebuchets and unpacking them as you approached.  The multiplayer is now easier to access than ever, and I have experienced very few problems with it so far. No more using Voobly!  But in conclusion as to whether to buy this game or not, I strongly reccomend it to anyone who grew up loving this game, and for newcomers who are interested in medieval strategy games, give it a go.  EDIT: Ignore the negative reviews, they are from when the game originally launched, it is much better now. I have not experienced any bugs or problems with the game since I purchased it in December 2015."

Its a awesome game but the multiplayer was a disappointment because I am from India and not many play this here and its a poorly been reworked and its not worth 20 bucks   So if u get it within 5$ then its a good game. The new campaign could have been better and its nice that not much is changed from the original game  If u love RTS then this game is the best
Do i really need to explain why recommend this game ?
"Collect Berries, Chop wood, Mine Gold, Build and Upgrade, And fight, Repeat. A really awesome RTS. One of Microsofts good games.  7/10"
This is the best game I've played so far.
"Walk in, see this, wat do?  Play Teuton. Kill enemies. ♥♥♥♥ was cash."
Killed a guy with a 6 metre spear.  11/10
"Grew up with this game, so of course I love this game!"
"More optimized than Age of Empires 3, 10/10"
"Well This game deserves to be a 9/10. Why? Lets go over with the basics: Age of Empires II was at a score of 92% while the Conquerors expansion is about 88% in total reviews. This game includes the actual Ages of Kings as well as the Conquerors. The gameplay in fact is the same as having those two games (nothing new except for the 500 population cap, widescreen support, Steam Workshop, Steam servers and leaderboard). The water, fire, cliffs, trees and effects have changed in order to make the game more HD. Single player is still the same but for the multiplayer, it was fixed before (last time, the players were out of sync). Well, this game deserves a gold."
Childhood Simulator 10/10
"Have only played the game for 2.6 hours but I already love it!  I recently purchased the game to play with a few friends at the price of $7.47. Little did I know the next day the game was on sale for $3.29... So I opened up a steam ticket in the morning before I made breakfast and before I was done eating the ticket had been approved even though I had played over 2 hours! Nice to see that the steam refund service works well.   Gameplay wise it's amazing, the game may seem old and outdated to those like me who have never played it before the HD version but to those who have played it before they say it is awesome. The amount of content and micro managing that needs to be done is enourmouse and always keeps you doing somthing. There are many different countries who you can play as and many differnt maps you can play on. Not to mention that there is steam workshop support which makes it so you can download custom maps and characters.  Although I haven't managed to play the game much so far I'm really enjoying what it has to offer and all the future fun I will have in solo and multiplayer with friends!  "
challenging but fun
"With new dedicated multiplayer, expanded resolution, built-in Twitch support, and ongoing support community, this game is a must-have for real-time strategy fans. One of the finest titles of the Age of Empires series has been given the support it needs to enhance the game for long-time fans, as well as introduce new players to the series. With most of the initial bumps smoothened, Hidden Path and Skybox have done a great job in bringing this game back for the modern gaming community.  The Forgotten Expansion is a must-have too. Incredible scenarios, new civs, and continuous support from the mod's development team has made The Forgotten one of the finest add-ons to any game I've played.  My only mark against it is the lack of functionality of its Workshop. While AoE2 HD has a diverse Workshop community, getting mods to appear in-game is a lot more difficult than it should be. Often, the 'subscribe' button doesn't seem to initiate a download, and many times mods simply aren't loaded. It's a shame, since this is pretty much the only major flaw in an otherwise great reboot."
Played as a child and stil no end in sight. Truly a classic in the RTS genre.  - Gets stil updates and online gaming works fine.
"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH !   - How Do You Turn This On ?  .... .... ....  ok... ... ...   - Marco ?  - Polo ?   - is Lumberjack in the house ?   - How about Robin Hood ?   - Where is the people I can Rock On   - Did some one bring some Cheese or Steak , from Jimmy's ?   - Hope onbody forgot the code of Aegis !   - I hope I R Winner then...   RATE: It's over 9000!!!!!!!  - in an ai match, type in group chat ( check boxing all ai) 100 , then enter..... see what happens......   Its going to be fun !!!!  "
"A true dream game for me would be if the design of AOEs I and II could be given a modest AOE3-style visual upgrade, but wihtout screwing everything up like they did in AOE 3. Yeah, the animations for AOEII haven't aged well, which means it's not QUITE as much fun to play as, say, Age of Mythology, but it's nice to spend time with an old friend I used to hang out with. A lot! And the HD upgrade certainly doesn't hurt!"
Spent 20 mins attacking a turorial mission castle. 10/10
This game is preeeettttyyy good. It reminds me of Age of Empires and Age of Empires II.  The hololo is also strong in this one.
"Works on Windows 10, does crash sometimes during cutscenes or trying to join a lobby for multiplayer but overall very solid game from the past."
ALL HAIL KING OF THE LOOSERS!! 'Gets rushed by massive army' AAAAH
it's like if clash of clans if clash of clans wasn't ♥♥♥♥
"I have discovered this game about 10 years ago and I have played it once in a while when I had the time for it.   I have rediscovered and invested more time in it last autumn and despite the fact that so many years passed since I've discovered it I am still playing it with the same curiosity and passion as if it would be for the very first time. It never gets old and I never get tired or bored with it. :)  I am happy that they made this HD update, it was more then necessary.   For all those who love medieval times, knights, castles and history this game is a must have and a must play!"
"Still one of the best strategy games in history. I really appreciate the balance between tactical fighting and watching your economy. I've been playing this game since I was young, thus being thankful it was brought up to date making it so much easier to play with your friends! It's actually unbelievable how many people still play this. :D Personally I can't review 'The Forgotten Empires' and 'The African Kingdoms' since I haven't played them this much yet but I'm curious.  One last thing: Even though I realise you cannot take the campaigns as historically accurate, it's still awesome learning about people you've never heard of in years of history classes."

"Other than multiplayer having some serious issue with lag, it is still just as good as it was originally"
A wonderful game if I've ever seen one. This game is an old isometric style and is probably the best strategy game I've ever played.
This is the best game I've played so far.

please play
Update: The review below was only for two days. It's been working fine ever since then. Great game.   Bought the game yesterday. Been able to join ONE multiplayer game out of maybe 20-30. For the rest of the games it just gets stuck at 'Joining multiplayer game...'. Don't buy this game until this issue is fixed.
"Im playing this game since 2003 and it never gets old, a classic and one of the best RTS games of all time. the HD version needs some fixing but its still really good overall and with the expansions ( campaing sucks but techs and civs are cool ) you expand the game to make it more fun and lets not forget the main reason why i got this game when i have the CD version THE MODS. i downloaded the Donald Trump Taunt pack and everytime i play defense and must build a wall i just type a number and ' WE MUST BUILD A WOLLLLL' GodEmperorTrump/10"

"I've played coutnless hours of this game before I bought it on steam, and nonetheless to say it's got everything, large scale combat, wonders, you can become an economic powerhouse to help your allies or to demolish your foes. I give this game 10/10, will continue to play forever."
I don't really like this- WOLOLO I love this game!!
Game crashed when I tried to build a house in the tutorial  Ten adda ten truly a masterpiece of a HD remake
I've play this game when it came out a long time ago on PC and im still playing to this day.
"The best 30 and 11 spamming simulator  Yeah but seriously, it's the game from childhood made to work on new computers. It's just good, nothing else to say"
It's nice to play with your friends and have massive battles... well untill the game crashes due to the enourmous number of soldiers in the battlefield of course.
"AoE II: HD is what a HD remake should be. If you loved AoC, this release gives the classic experience as you remember... with mod support! And online matchmaking! Love it, 10/10."
Killed a guy with a 6 metre spear.  11/10
Been playing this game pretty much since I've played PC games. Intend to keep playing it.
"As epic as it was years ago, the new HD reboot did not disappoint. Age Of Empires remains, to this day, one of the best real-time strategies on the market, rivalling games such as Star Craft and Supreme Commander. I'd recommend this to any gamer out there, casual or hardcore.  - 9/10"
One of the best RTS games of all time
Farmville 2 is a great First person shooter for beginners. There's a lot to do. The campaign is great and there are a lot of customisations for all your needs
"Amazing strategy game. Easy to learn, hard to master.   Still not convinced? OK, then... WOLOLO   You're now convinced."
"A peerless RTS straight out of 1999, probably the most played game of my childhood who's intricate balance and strategies still stand the test of time with a an active and modestly large community 16 years on. The HD Edition brings steam integration and additional content such as 'Forgotten Empires' to a game that has truely stood the test of time. "
"I've been a fan of this game since forever, so here it goes."
"This game is simply amazing, can get fairly boring alone but if you play with some friends..."
Great fun to play with friends
The first pc game I ever played was Age of Empires one. I loved that game. AOEII was also an amazing release years ago and was my favorite game for a long time. Having it re-released in HD is icing on the cake for a gamer like me! This series has always meant a lot to me.
"The King of Real Time Strategy games. AoE II is, and always will be, the best RTS game of all time."
"If u love crushing your friends, u will fall in love with AOE II."
"Worth the purchase even if you have the origional; increased preformance, easier multiplayer, new expansion is amazing"
"If you enjoyed the original, purchase this game. Its worth the refined graphics that maintain there retro look. The online multiplayer is also incredibly convenient and simple. This is the specific age of empires gamers seem to fall back to and its for good reason. The campain is sorta tough though so practice makes perfect!   P.S. If you are new to the game, dont be intimidated by the learning curve. Five matches, and you will be storming the keeps like a pro."
Played it as a kid so glad its been remastered and a new expansion has been added.
"Turn off some of the 3D settings unless you really care about how your static water looks and this game will play the same as when it was brand new (back in the day). Awesome game, still a classic!"
"Despite the slew of strategy games that I've played in the past ten years, there is no game that I have returned to with a greater passion than Age of Empires II. Its arcadey gameplay style does not detract from the epicness as you advance from the Dark Ages to the early Renaissance. Watching your population grow, armies expand, and cities grow is as exciting as commanding armies in large one-on-one fights. Sounds and visuals may be dated, but still entertaining. The availability of Mods and minigames designed by other fans makes the game worth so much more than $20.  If there's one complaint, it's that not enough people want to play the Forgotten Expansion online, which is a shame as the expansion improves the gameplay with more civilizations, maps, and game modes. I highly recommend that history and strategy game fans pick up the full Age of Empires II HD + Forgotten Expansion during a Steam Sale when the price drops to around $10. Oh great lord, I'll see you on the next battlefield!"
"BEST EVER. Used to play as a kid and now I own it again, greaty multiplayer action"
It was good then and it's good now.
"This is by far my favorite RTS game for many reasons. A defeat is not treated as a failure, but more as a lesson. It will make you build your economy dexterously and assemble your army ealier in the match next time. The graphics are applealing to the eye, even in the 1999 version. A perfect balence of colors and lighting make the game what it is. Each civilization is unique by having their own units and upgrades. They are all balenced, so you can not defeat another player by rushing your civilization's only special units. Also, thanks to the HD version, multiplayer is back without having to use a 3rd party client (ex. Vlooby). A perfect and entertaining game to play at an LAN party, or hell, anywhere.            Too bad AoE 3 was ♥♥♥♥ing trash."
This game is good
Great game
It s k.
"War, war and more war... still a better love story than twilight. 10/10 - addicted, +100000000 hours worth. just buy it, it's brilliant :)"
is rly gud
"Guys, all HD means is that it is capable of playing at 1080p, not that they implemented D3D11 tesselation and dynamic lighting into the darn thing. The HD in AOEIIHD is not a misnomer. Map scrolling is silky smooth, optional population cap increase to 500, all in all a faithful recreation of a classic game to help it look and run its best on modern systems. Make sure to turn off whatever silly specular mapped ocean texture they implemented and to download a mod to restore the original graphics for things like the resource icons and farms if you want the game to look exactly as you remember it. 8/10 because the multiplayer ping is still only as low as its weakest link. Also, $20 is a ripoff, patience will reward you with it going on sale for $5 every so often."
I played way too much of this game :/
it's good
"I sucked when it came out, and I still suck to this day, but it's always fun to kill some Mongols with Vipers."
Tons of fun with friends. Retaining the similar gameplay aspects triggers nostalgia and the graphical update is just right to make this version playable in this day and age.
best game I have played in a long time
"It's a meme with friends, and I haven't played it alone, so yep, it's a meme, so it's worth it."
"When it comes to RTS games, this is the first title that comes into mind. One of the best RTS games ever made, with a huge variety of tactics to choose from, civilisations that have different play styles, a great challage for micro and macro management freaks and also still fresh thanks to the steam workshop. Recommended to all RTS fans."
this game is off the chain!!  but like seriously. If u like vampires and dragons well then this is the game u r looking for
"Best RTS ever. Great campaign, good balancement, awesome setting, lots of fun"
great game:)))
A Classic RTS upgraded to run on modern systems.
"Very nice game really worth the money, especially when i bought it for 3 euro on steam summer sale, and im suprised i didnt get this earlier because its totally worth the full price 20€ and ive always been a fan of Age of Empires series :)"
Always had fun playing this game during school.
So many years passed but this game still best Age Of Empires ROCKS!!!!
"Hmm where to start?This game is a classic,it reminds of my childhood.This game should have been on Steam ages ago. You can play campaigns based on real historical people which is awesome.The game is basically addictive cause you can employ many tactics on pretty good A.l. For strategy lovers this game is a must buy.And now with steam workshop and modding community it is even better.And music is awesome.In short buy this game if you have interest in RTS games."
"What can I say, I've have played this game for most of my life and got excited for the HD version. I didnt pre order it and regret it because the re booted multiplayer and less dead pixed grass and sea is something that alows me to re-have the fun I had when I was a kid. It is the reviving of the dying RTS games and promits those who havn't got around to this game play it. The game mastered all that was asked of it in its day and still has, the only issue I have with it is the price its currently at (not the christmas sale price but the standered), its a little high and I recomend to get it at $15 or so. On the bright side it even has the Conquerors DLC with it so I didn't miss out any of my previous experience with this game. It only took me 5 minutes to fall in love with its HDness. Hopefully you like the game as much as i have."
"A game I keep in my top 3 no matter how many new games come out, a complete classic"
Remember this game... wow it brings back some good old memories. why not give it a bash im sure we could have some fun with it again
Wololo
11/10 Awesome when the Spanish super villagers completey obliterate the entire map.
"A satisfying and large Age of Empires game. I especially enjoy the level editor where you can create your own terrain, battles, and scenarios. It's definitely worth the money and a necessity for any age of empires fan,"
One of all time favorite games. The HD version just makes it look that much nicer. It might be me but I think they increased the AI also. Moderate is more like Hard from the past versions.
"In 1999, on this dinosaur of a computer, I played Age of Empires 2 for the first time.  Back then, I was four years old and not the best player, but enjoyed real time strategy games the most. I would do things like make the female villagers get berries, lambs, and farm, and make the males woodcut, get gold, stone, and occasionally mix them up if I thought some of them were getting lonely. Now I realise how much of a waste of time that was, but it's still funny to look back on, and some say there were hidden buffs with those villagers' genders, so maybe I wasn't all wrong.  There's a lot of little nuances that are impressive that many modern games do not take into account. Things like having a defensive boost at the top of a hill, or recreating a civilization from a stockpile of 50 spare food (Ha!), or setting a house on fire with a sword (Ha ha!). It's easier to appreciate now that I'm better at video games, and slightly more masochistic. The campaign level design on the base game alone, which includes Age of Kings and the Conquerors expansion, will give you over a hundred hours of playtime.   The developers give this game a lot of love, and are a nice salute to Ensemble's masterpiece. For instance, in the HD edition, there is better AI that was developed with the Forgotten expansion. The hard AI now actually acts smarter, instead of cheating by getting more resources. So, you can also effectively crush the AI's economy now through raiding and such which was questionable before.  The workshop is also nice. I enjoy the texture mods to make the scenery more beautiful and the fire more realistic. Also more blood, and corpses staying longer. More taunts. Player-made campaigns. A lot of competative players like the '♥♥♥♥♥wood' mod to make the trees tiny.  Overall, I've been impressed with the HD edition, and nominated it for the 'Test Of Time' award. What other game on steam still has an underestimated active playerbase of over 5,000 people daily for a game from the 90s? Writing this at 10:10am, there is 7,142 people ingame, and it's peaked to 11,616 in the past 30 days. If you like strategy games, this will be a game you come back to again and again.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *Reader wants to thumb down review* Wololo! *Reader wants to thumb up review*  (Please show some love!  If you do thumb down my review, please give me a reason why in the comments. Critiques are helpful. Thank you!)"
this game is good.
"Been playing AOE I and II since I was young. I never get sick of the game, there are constant challenges and improvements to be make in your skills. All of this added content is a huge bonus!"
"I remember playing this on my brother's Windows 98 PC many many years ago, I had more hours in this game than I have in Rocket League now. As a veteran of the original I can testify that The HD Steam version does the original more than justice, everything thing is there and I had a nostalgia trip for hours when I first got this. If you're a fan of classic RTS, resource management sims, GET THIS GAME. The workshop support and continued release of expansions adds even more to this amazing classic title."
"AoE II is the best rts games I have played to date. Easy to learn, difficult to become great.  Pros: Variety of game modes which keep the game fresh Campaigns  Difficulty adjustments AI that can be amazing or horrible Online multiplayer  Cons: Online multiplayer again: not entirely sure it isn't just my connection, but I sometimes don't get to finish games, which can be realllllly frusterating. Yet, this comes and goes, and works perfectly about 80% of the time.  Hell: AI monk armies.  This is one my all time favorite games and for 3-5 dollars just add it to your inventory now.  8.5/10 would fight my own converted army again."
"Age of empires 2 is a game everyone should play at least once in their lifetime. This is how we did it in the early 2000's boys, and it's still just as good today as it was back then. LAN Party!"
"Probably one of my favorite games and my friends got this for me on a whim. The game takes a lot of practice, but the battles are nontheless satisfying. I usually don't realize that I've delved an hour or two into a really big game.   This is the kind of game you and your friends may play for fun together, but end up getting really competitive."
stands the test of time.
"This was the first game I remember playing, with this I learnt a lot. I was around 4 when I first played it, so I learnt not only about history but also, for example, a lot of vocabulary, among many other things (the basics os strategy, economy, etc.). It got me into gaming. I have the original Gold Edition with the Conquerors expansion (the physical CD) but I bought this so that I could play online. I'm glad to know there's still a big community of gamers playing it. This game is a legend."
Wolololo simulator  10/10  Would wololo again :D
"Been playing AOE I and II since I was young. I never get sick of the game, there are constant challenges and improvements to be make in your skills. All of this added content is a huge bonus!"
this game is good.
Good old times and a total classic for such a cheap price. Worth it.
"A fabulous game that matches everything that was great about the original that I remember. The only problems I'd say would be the occasional glitch or slow processing, but I honestly would recommend this to any player, new or old."
If you are looking in the comments for a reason to buy this game you've already been thinking about it too long.
START THE GAME ALREADY
"The first time I had played this game must have been at the turn of the millenium, and damn was it impressive back then and damn is it still today. One of history's greatest games."
Superb game. I can spend endless hours and it never get's boring.
"Love the game, been playing since vanilla pc and ps2 versions, was so happy for remastered version.   Suggest buying, ive gotten over 350+ hours already and plan for more :)"
Love it. This game will never get old its the best RTS of all time. Glad to see it up and running on modern computers after all this time.
Still one of the best RTS games of all time. Dev's keep updating and adding new content which is awesome for a game this old. Defintely worth a buy!
- Sees AoE II on sale - Buys it - Launches map editor - builds myself a gigantic fortress - builds 400 paladins - makes opponents bases small - full of nothing but villagers - launches the massacre - grins - 10/10 would commit genocide again  (lol to be serious though I used to play this little known game back when it was young and it kicks even more buttocks now due to HD/workshop/2 new expansions!! highly recommend!!!)
"One of the best medievel games to follow up AoE l It is one of my all time favorite games, I played as a child in early 2008 and my god I loved it. With all the new additions and such I feel AoE 2 is improving everyday with a wonderful community and such the only problems I really see is the bugs that sometimes accompany the game after long periods of time not playing it. 10/10"
A classic. One of the few games that I'll always come back and play.   First time I played it was maybe when I was 10. I still remember feeling pretty smart for knowing some history other kids didn't.
"Ah, The nostalgia. Several hours being drowned and immersed in AoE II without a care in the world. &lt;3"
"The original was the second game i ever had, in 2005, i barely spoke any english. to see that this game had a dutch translation was a pain to my heart... may we all learn English by playing Age of Empires 2"
"And endless classic, thanks for making it available for current screens and systems. Difficulty and strategy tweaks feel difficult at first but needed."
"Childhood games,  The one game that you'd throw into your old windows 98 waiting for it to boot up. Wishing for a Lan party to play with your friends but there wasn't. you'd spend thousands of hours perfecting the campaign and playing against large numbers of bots. how do you turn this on how do you turn this on how do you turn this on how do you turn this on how do you turn this on furious the monkey boy furious the monkey boy furious the monkey boy furious the monkey boy furious the monkey boy  After all those years you can only remember the most frightening memory of the game:   WOOOLOLOOOLOLOLOL WOOLOLOLOLOL WOOOOLOLOLOLOL"
Still the best RTS out there!
"The BEST strategy game ever, Ive been playing this game since I was child and still spent hours playing it"
Take some notes from here pls:  CLASSIC. END.
One of the best games ever made on pc
'wololo' changing colors since 1997
I did this for the badge - Pre good game i guess 10/10
Very good game! Lives up to the old one! The hotkey changes alone are worth it.
"Buy it for my childhood, over SIX years addicted to it. GREATEST RTS game ever. And the world editor - my programming guide. GG."
Has shooting cars.   8/10
"All this game ever needed was some modern polish, and that's what we got."
"This game might not have the graphics, but it makes up for it with the gameplay.   B.T.W Help showing Valve how much we want Half-Life 2: episode 2 sequel by voting it as 'Game That Deserves A Sequel' in Steam Awards."
"i really enjoy playing this game, its full of strategy and a lot of fun to play. i reccommend this game to my friends for sure! also the are a lot of community items like maps gamemodes and even more, even when you think you saw everthing in this game there will come more and it will always suprise you again. 9,5/10 the graphics are a litle old but that doesnt mean this game is bad at all its almost perfect!"
Still as great and maybe even better than the AoE2 we all knew and loved when we grew up
Its to Westerners what Starcraft is to Koreans.
Wololo
I have played this game since i was a little buby midget. I have always enjoyed it and now the hd edition is out i highly recommend it for any strategy game finatics and anyone who would like to join the strategy community. Thank you for reading :-D
Do i really need to explain why recommend this game ?
"Collect Berries, Chop wood, Mine Gold, Build and Upgrade, And fight, Repeat. A really awesome RTS. One of Microsofts good games.  7/10"
"A good remake. Somewhat buggy and missing some options like changing the resolution (and I had to dig deep through arcane forum posts and mildly mess with the game files to get it to even start on 2 different PCs), but a faithful remake, and the multiplayer is way easier to get going than Zone / ip connect / even voobly. The new AI is pretty tough, and the balance tweaks are nice.  If you haven't played the game before, it's an RTS classic. No strategy is dominant, at non-competitive levels of play it's totally viable to make up crazy strategies as you go. A good variety of units, techs, and buildings, but not too much to be overwhelming. The early game can be fairly actions-per-second heavy but once you get going, the groove of maintaining your action rate and balancing your macro and micro is very satisfying."
Classic and best RTS game in HD.....nostalgia.
"Played this game since I was a child. This is the best game of the series by far for the following reasons:  1) Medieval setting (Opinion) 2) More competitive and larger playerbase 3) Less unique but more variety of civs 4) Overall better mechanics and smoother gameplay, as long as graphics don't bother you.  This is a must have for those who like RTS games. "
The best strategy game of all time. I will play this the rest of my life.
everything i have ever wanted all in one game
Awesome game back then even better today with all the updates and support is recieves.
"I am strictly bad at this game. Literally lose every game I play. That doesn't stop from playing it. It actually makes me wanna play it more. I hope that one day I'll win, but until then I'll just keep playing."
"I used to play this game as a kid, and me now finding it on steam, was one of the most awesome experiences ever, Me battling other kingdoms on my way to the top, Fantastic. Great buy if your looking for a strategy game"
This Game Is A Masterpiece
Shout out to Steam Support for replying to my help comment in a couple hours and fixed this amazing game when I couldnt get it to work
Best RTS on Steam.
"While (minus the expansions) only a graphical update of the orignal game, it still has not lost its appeal, and the expansions only add to that. I would recommend this to anyone who never played the original, or if you are looking to still play online with friends."
"only an hour playing and I'm already in love, It's like the classic AoE ... but better"
Old but Gold
"Super simple, Super fun, Super everything. I played this before the HD remake and MAN was it fun."
Works great on Windows 10 and a must-have classic for those Age of Empires fans. Also tons of new content to explore.
This is a very good classic game that can run well on pretty much any machine. Especially on sale it's a steal.  8/10
The first pc game I ever played was Age of Empires one. I loved that game. AOEII was also an amazing release years ago and was my favorite game for a long time. Having it re-released in HD is icing on the cake for a gamer like me! This series has always meant a lot to me.

"Having played this game when i was young, i was pleasantly suprised it was on steam AND even has new dlc. So i bought it on sale (i recommend this since its pretty expensive with the dlc). So now i explored the community wich still exists and is active on youtube and here. Even tough i have not played ranked since i think i am too bas at the game to win it (maybe because i watch top class players on youtube) i still recommend this game (thats why i have 90 hours in it). When i first bought it it had some desync and disconnect issues (some of them still exist) but some are fixed.   Pros: -Active community -Cool custom maps -Age of empires -Working online without downloading 3rd party software -Nostalgia -New dlc and more coming -The series bred a nice meme -How do you turn this on -Hard to master (almost impossible) -Alot i mean ALOT of strats (persian dousche, drush and more)  Cons: -connection/sync isnt always that good  -Alot of lag -Games take a long time "
"The King of Real Time Strategy games. AoE II is, and always will be, the best RTS game of all time."
"My childhood, remade and getting new expansions a decade on. Who'd have thought? Far too much of a classic to not win the Test of Time award, to be honest. Especially when there's improvements and additions being added, too!"
Really like this game :)
"Ever since this game was out, it was my favorite. Now I can say for sure that it still is :)"
"What an amazing game that has truly stood the test of time in the gaming world. Nothing will ever rival the perfect execution of the Age of Empires franchise. HD reboot through steam looks amazing on new machines and runs very smoothly, very enjoyable. Multiplayer ability is also a huge plus, used to be difficult to make LAN connections work back in the day - now we can play all over the world! A perfect game is one that remains fresh and engaging to players everywhere but can be improved with graphics upgrades, multi-player features and more."
Can't beat the classics
My all time favourite game!
Best strategy game of all time
It's ok.
A classic. One of the best.
"Because this game came out in 1999, I can truly say:  WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE!?  This game is amazing!! Don't be afraid that after 17 years this game no longer has updates or players, because it does! The most recent update was YESTERDAY as of now."

I approve of this game.
One of the classic RTS games.
Best Classic Game Of All Time!
Try and make a better RTS. I dare you.
I may not have a million hours on this game but I have played Age of Empires one and two since I was a child. Nothing beats the classic feel of this RTS. More game modes and maps than ever. This game is hands down a classic that will always will remain on speed dial in my library.  Only one down side of this version is that there is no LAN support.  I still rate this game 10/10.
"Honestly, I've had so many great experiences with this game. I love the strategy involved with micro managing your economy, army, and trade. It's just very detailed I guess."
Excellent RTS! Many thanks for this!
One of my favourites... I've played this game for years I'm really stoked I get the chance to play it remastered. A real classic in my view
I've played this game since i was 6 and I still love it &lt;3. I Especially like playing it with my friends. It's a great game where u can play together or against each other. It's just a game made for ppl like me ;)
This is a great game! I played the original version but the HD edition is so much better! I haven't played this version quite as many hours as the original but I'm sure it will soon catch up!
The greatest game ever!
"If you want a game with big explosions and cutting edge graphics, this is not a game for you. Age of Empires II is a huge nostalgia trip where sheep scout the world, arrows set fire to buildings, and monks can convert elephants to Christianity. The gameplay is quick and easy to get into, but extremely difficult to master. 10/10, would waste childhood on this game again."
This is the game I grew up on. The HD remake takes it and makes it playable in the new age. Bravo to the new developers for bringing back this classic!
"I think it speaks to how good this game is that not only has it had a wildly popular remaster, there is still proffessional level content being made for a game this old. Y'all should play it"
Best game through time!
"I used to play this game as a kid, and me now finding it on steam, was one of the most awesome experiences ever, Me battling other kingdoms on my way to the top, Fantastic. Great buy if your looking for a strategy game"

Just an awesome trip to memory lane...
Still one of the best games ever.
Great game!
very fun and addictive 10/10
Best age of empires game
"Still trying to figure out why its been 19 years and they havnt made a game better than AOE2. The profit margin would be through the roof. Other than bomberman on turbogrfx, nothing compares. Been playing since the demo of AOE1. Favorite game of all time, never gets boring and beyond a classic.  PLEASE MAKE AN AOE4 THATS MORE LIKE 2 THAN 3!"
"The game that perfected the RTS genre is back! It is astounding how well this game fares when you compare it to its current competitors, and with the new steamworks-based online multiplayer replacing the dead and gone microsoft games lobby, the multiplayer is just as alive today as it was back in 99. The extra expansions also improve upon the games with new and exciting civs, new castle and university technologies for all civs, and a more balanced (read: not only based on early galley rushes) navy. The steam workshop support is also a nice feature, allowing for simple texture and sound alteration.   If you enjoy the RTS genre, get this game. It is and has been a mainstay of the genre for almost 20 years, and like many of the other masterwork RTS games it's easy to pick up, but oh so hard to master."
One of the best games i have ever played! Brings back so much memories! &lt;3
"Great RTS classic! Still play it today, and definetly one of my all-time favorites. The graphics can still be considered good, and the gameplay is excelent. I also bought the two expansion packs.  Definetly recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games. Love the taunts, love the gameplay, love the little details, everything at this game is good. There MIGHT be problems with multiplayer, but if you manage to overlook those, it's a great and fun game  NOTE: I have played this before i bought it on Steam too, so those hours you can see on my profile don't represent all of the time I played this game for."
"I have played the Age of Empires games my ENTIRE LIFE. This IP has brought me more hours of gameplay then even The Sims. Age of Empires II: HD is THE best version of the game ever released. I still find myself coming back to this game at least every month. The new expansions are great, too. If you like RTS, then you will love AoE II: HD."
"I don't think there is a better contender than this game for the Test of Time award. I mean, how could there be? This game has literally ruled the RTS genre for as long as it has been available. The countless hours spent on this during college is a constant source of conversation amongst friends and will continue to be in the years to come."
"Reminds me of my childhood, i wish people still played this game religiously like they did before 2004."
  One of my fav RTS childhood games
Greatest game of all time
"Great game, was able to make my girlfriend cry by destroying her village and letting one builder survive. When she had started to make a new village i came in like a wreckingball and destroyed her village once again and wrote 'all your base are belong to me', did this like five times before she had a mental breakdown. 10/10."
"Its the perfect mix of old style game with new content strategies and mods. New AI for solo players like me and even a competitive scene for someone who enjoys it.  It is a remake, but it enhances a lot of parts of the gameplay. If you were a fan of the game years before, this version will for sure make you feel warmth inside."
It's amazing!! I have always loved the Age Of Empires games and 2 was by far my favorite and the fact that they added new expansions makes me love it all the more.. Plus now i can play online with my friends which is awesome!!!
When somoene writes a negative review of age of empires 2 on steam (because it's red).  Wolololo. Reviews becomes positive (because positive reviews are blue).    01/01  Wolololo  10/10!
"If you could only own ONE real-time stradegy game, I would recommend Age of Empires 2 (With Warcraft 3 coming in second). This game retains everything that made the original release good, but touches it up with enhanced graphics and smarter AI (in the original, they had a habit of getting themselves stuck on each other, but this game all but resolves that issue)."
"Great fun to play around with, with all your mates. An instant and eternal classic RTS."
Age of Empires 2 is an awesome game. It looks the same as i remember it when i played it the first time. That's all to say
One of the best games ever made.
Sure I recommend this game mainly because my friend loves it and its the only game we canreally play together ofc I suck at it the pathing is horrible the units confuse and just building a base is a task among itself however its still quite enjoyable fighting endless streams of men not to mention the extreme satisfaction when you blow up a base just mmm this is one of those older games that I believe stood the test of time with some minor tweaks in that ai pathing it would be way better XD
"Very fun game and it can be really competitive if u want to. I recommend this game, it is a masterpiece even it is really old"
"Awesome, will sometimes play online with friends, HUGE fan of the Age of empires series, and this is thee best one yet 10/10"
Great remaster. works well.   If you loved AoE 2 grab this.
"Still amazing 17 years later, and STILL getting supported. If you love RTS games check this one out!"
reliving my childhood as never been more fun
"I remember playing this game when I was even younger with my next door neighbours on their old Toshiba laptop.....oh those were the days of not knowing hwo good PC Gamign would get. Anyways the game is great, a prime example I love to use when describing the 'strategy' section to my friends. The game succeeds in almost all places, including but not limited to: animations, variety, content and overall fun. Now that this game is on Steam, don't hesitate! if you have any interest in the strategy genre you will love this game.  Gameplay You will spend most of your game hours organising your village/kingdom/town/empire (the word varies from culture to culture damnit!) This usually involves sending your settlers to build things or sending your troops off to war. What I really love about the gameplay is when you get into battle, you can control troops to utilise rush tactics as well as flanking. You will put many hours in the game just testing out strategies on AI just to see what happens. The game is that fun and honestly I don't think they could have done a better job considering the time period for when this game was originally released.   Performance This is one of the few things I dislike about this game, performance. Now because it is an extremely old game, I must obviously recognise that they didn't use 60 FPS back then and that the technology then wasn't capable of pushing the types of textures and frames per second I route for. However, when you call your game a 'HD Edition' yoru customers will assume it is a scaled up version, thsi includes texture quality being improved (significantly) and frame rate being modenised to a solid 60. AOE 2 does not do that, instead of actually taking the time to change the game at all, they converted it onto a file and shipped it off to steam to make a further profit. This is not the route they should have taken, I don't care if your game was originally released in the 90's because if you re-release that product as a 'remaster' or a 'HD Edition' then you MUST and NEED TO update the game to include better FPS and better Texture Quality, those should be requirments.   Conclusion if you were a big fan of this game when it released, you will still like it now.....mainly because nothing has been changed to improve the game. With that being said, I still really enjoy the game despite its technical issues as it allows good, juicy nostalgia to flow through me once again. Hurray!  -JoshuaUpham"
One of the best RTS games I have ever played. Perfect 10/10
One of the greatest RTS's ever. Could use civ specific skins but otherwise gg.
"One of the best RTS games I have ever played. Halo Wars is a close second. I played this game after I got it for my birthday back in 2001. I love this game and I will play it with my brothers and friends if I ever have the chance. Only problem is that you cannot reload a multiplayer save. Forget ever being able to come back to a game, it will never load.  Also, the DLCs after fifteen years? GG"
5/5 A timeless classic. Remains one of the best RTS games ever in my mind.
"A classic game, brought back to life. I will forever love this game, and no longer from purely nostalgia. Holds up to todays standards, and is still incredibly fun to play with friends. IT IS STILL BEING UPDATED AND RECIEVING DLC!!!! How great is that!   Have had a bit of networking issues with the game, and the movement of units is kinda janky. These are drops in a thunderstorm of positive things.   OVERALL: I give this game an extremely solid 8/10 and commend Microsoft(?) for bringing it back to life."
"Still the best strategy game out there. Enjoy all the conquests, messing around on singleplayer and the multiplayer is great too."
"One of the best games out there as you can see by my hours played. But maybe I just really like this genre. Really fun with friends, try out some of the weirder game maps you might love them."
The gold standard of RTS's
One of the best RTS ever created. There is not much to say apart from that.
This game will keep you up for hours and you wouldnt even notice. I once forgot to sleep and morning arrived.
"One of the best known classic Strat. games of all time. Was fun playing threw the Campaign again. And it also teaches history. John of Arc, El'Sid and alot more was very informative."
A great little strategy classic. I still have occasional fun playing co-op with a friend against PC opponents.
Still as fun as the first day I played it over a decade ago (the original that is)
&gt;Play 6 player FFA with friends &gt;Get roflstomped by mass cavalery because you arent so good &gt;Notice that only thing remeaning for you are 2 cannon galeons and some war galleys &gt;Proceed with being a ♥♥♥♥ to everyone from water &gt;Lose friends because of me being an ♥♥♥♥ for next 15 minutes.  10/10 would repeat again.
"This is my favorite RTS of all time, even today it still hold a lot of nostolgia to when i was younger and would play LAN parties with friends whenever we visited. It is awesome to see that new content is still being added (albeit slow) and it makes it worth buying on steam, even though i still have the origional CD-ROM expansions.  A great classic and worth buying/trying out."
Game of my childhood! 10/10
Playing bongo music by clicking on house i member
Best game tbh fam
Great game
Only one word :  Wololoooo
"A game as good as it ever has been. The expansions have a lot of highs and lows, and in my opinion are a bit overpriced for what they are, but I love that they exist at all. The new AI is a lot of fun to play against, which is great because I'm not good enough to play online!  Other than that, this is a classic game optimized for todays hardware and monitor resolutions. I've never had any performance issues, though I don't play a lot online, usually just co-op against the AI with a buddy."
"A beautiful remaster which adds some gameplay upgrades, including most wanted attack 'on point' function, definitely for AoE fans. Hope AoE I will receive similar treatment in the future."
"A very memorable game, that will never be forgotten in the hearts of many."
"in truth this is one of my favorite games i ever played. i logged more than a thousand hours in this when i first had it before steam. in truth i am a fanboy that sucks at playing against real people but still love to try to hold my own, sometimes you can make magic happen or you can just end up playing an extra thirty in to an hour in an slowly yet ever growing defeat. still i love this game and i am glad it still has a strong community to play with"
"AoE II is that kind of game that never gets old, you played when you were a kid, you played as a teen and now you play it as an adult. So, easily to say, its one of the best games around to this day."
"Oh man, Age of Empires 2 has to be my alltime favaorite statagy game. Altough there are great startegy games around I feel like this is the best of them, largely cause of the balanceing. Age of empires is an unique game cause all troops and buildings have counter units and u relly need the expansions to feel it as they add more civilizations and u get surtain troops earlier witch helps the 'all troops have an counter' idea behind the game.  For me the worst thing is this game requiresa lot of time to master. Started playing when I was quite young so I didn't understand it at first but got the basics of the game down. When HD came out I bought the HD version of this game and then I started learning more on how this game works, learning the new startegys and how to get better at the game. It will take time to learn the game but it honestly is worth it. There's not much toxicty in the game and alot of the experienced players actually are willing ot help u get better(not all).  I strongly reccomend this game to everyone who wants a good balanced startegy game."
Playing this game since 2006. Beautiful :D
This game should win the test of time because I have heard this game since I was little and now that I have it still being an awesome game
"Nice to play the game after so many years. Not that mutch has changed, but enough to keep the game intersting."
Fun and good community
"Ever Wonder why AoE is always on discussion? Simply, because you can play it for hours and never give up a game until it is finished. Call it 'addictive' or 'insane fun'. Age of Empires is an excellent way to ease the mind or create a furious amount of stress until you meet the real competition.  For those who have never played AoE or spent time away, etc., here is what you have missed...  Online multiplayer can be highly aggressive (sometimes you last 10 minutes to 10 hours). Civilization choice can become your best conquest or ultimate defeat. Campaigns, are fairly thought out to play against AI   *Expertise comes from Age of Empires II, Age of Kings, Conquerer's Expansion, The Forrgotten Kingdoms*  This game has been a great investment strategy... -'Never give your opponent mercy, or you might as well leave the battle'. -   "
"This game is pretty bad i would give it... *WOLOLO* ...this game is really good love to play it with friends, and it's a game from my childhood. Graphics are good gamplay is unique and exciting i would give this a 9/10. Would love to get updates with even more civs etc."
"A timeless classic of a game, let down by shoddy developers trying to milk the game for all it's worth.   Check out  www.aoczone.net  and  www.voobly.com  for competitive AoE 2 tournaments and news!"
Old but Gold
"One of the greatest games of all time, never fails to entertain me"
"ENG:  The best strategy game on Steam in the whole, the best gameplay and attractiveness, as well as the scope. Better game than the CIV! Referral!  FIN:  Paras strategia peli, koko Steamissa, paras pelattavuus ja kiinnostavuus sekä laajuus. Parempi peli kuin CIV! Suositteluni!"
"10/10  AoE II is one of few games that can remind you the good old days. Proper nostalgia.   This game has everything you ask for a strategic game. It's not 'create units instantly and start an attack asap'. In order to achieve your goals you need to think fast and act faster. You'll not have an army without proper economic power. I was a child when the game first came out. I used to play with me close friend. When I went to his house, his mother wouldn't let us to play video games. We were hiding the installer of demo and trying to play it without getting caught. When we were older, we cheated in game. Instant soldiers, immenent battles. We thought this battles could lead us to victory but no. We were just fooling ourselves.  Without cheats and playing it with rules is not easy. Start with one civilization and stick to it untill you know them well. In time your brain will think more things. Knowing your units' weakness will help you well. That is what will lead to your victory. Also knowing math will help."
This is one of the best old school games. Created with finess and class. Another game like this need to be made.
highly recommend.
"Great to play this classic again, remember back in the days all my classmates played it as well when we came home from school. Great memories!"
"This is one of the Greatest strategy games I've played. I own several others, and I can definately say that this one beats most others. With a wide variety of ways to beat the enemy, and hours of gameplay, one never runs out of things to do. The game has very good replay value, and even without the multiplayer the AI is pretty good... No match when you have them on easy, but as you move the difficulty of the AI you can get a real challenge. I would recommend this game to any gamer, that likes a game that isn't just action must also think."
Just like i remember it. The good ol days back in the early 2000s. Beautiful.
Played 4 hours against an A.I. when i finally had him he gave up. 5/7 would fight 4 hours against an A.I until it gives up again.

I love this game since i was a kide ♥
"Timless classic that is still fun through the ages. Also nice that they are still updating it, including releasing new DLC."
he'll yeah. . . True Game For All The True Gamers Out There
Why not?
I missed to play this game ! and now I can play it in windows 10 !!! I can't stop playing this game !
Still one of the all-time greatest RTS games. A true classic in every way.
This is one of the best old school games. Created with finess and class. Another game like this need to be made.
"nice strategy game, pretty micro intensive"
highly recommend.
"Great to play this classic again, remember back in the days all my classmates played it as well when we came home from school. Great memories!"
A game from 1999 and still has over 10000 players daily Enough said
very fun when you dont play with spencer green (when lagging). you shouldnt get the game ever as wyatt has it
THE old time classic ! First time i played it was before even steam was out! Oh the childhood memories...
"Honestly the best rts ever made, the gameplay at first seems very repetitive, but there are an endless amount of ways to win. The teutorial is honestly amazing and literally everyone should play this game."
Wololo
Great to see this game still being played in this day and age. Also nice to see that there are devlopers still devoted to keeping the game in shape. Hope AOE stays strong and lives the test of time.
"I have played the Age of Empires since 1997, i think i can play this series in the next 10 years! I no only played the game in the MSN game zone with my 56k dial-up internet a long time ago, but also in the steam with broadband now ."
One of the greatest old school RTSs. Much respect.
A great little strategy classic. I still have occasional fun playing co-op with a friend against PC opponents.
"Old feelings relive. Although it's graphics are still way worse then AoE 3, or even AoE 1 in my opinion, the game itself is great. There is loads of things to choose from, from civilization to map to difficulty, all to satisfy your needs and get you to play a nice game on your level. The workshop addition and new DLC's make the game even better, but after 200+hours I still suck :(  8/10 :D"
"Great game, brings back a lot of memories from the old MSN Zone days. Only real negative is the game no longer supports local LAN matches."
very fun when you dont play with spencer green (when lagging). you shouldnt get the game ever as wyatt has it
I dont have many steam hours logged and honestly even if my hours on the original version were tracked I probably still dont have many. However this is quite possibly my favorite game. I grew up playing the original version of this and the rest of the series. They are what got me started in gaming and this is the best installment of the trilogy.
"Age of Empires 2 is one of those classic games that both old and new players alike can be gripped by the magical world, in a metaphorical sense, which comprises of ancient civilisations and countless converting monks.   Having played this game excessively in my childhood, it was a distinct pleasure to be able to purchase it for a mere £2.99 (though if i had known it was on steam i would have payed full price no doubt!) which is an absolute bargain of a price. There are many RTS games out there, some simple, some complex, but none have the same majesty of Age of Empires 2; Age of mythology was a good game, as was AOE 3, but none are just so simple, yet so complex as AOE2 that they can warrant the same price tag in today’s standards.  Regarding actual gameplay, it can be said that the graphics look a tad dated, but personally i think it plays to the games strengths, the idle animations are rather quaint, and the sounds as well as the ambiance is all very satisfying; this truly is one game where an hour feels like five minutes, and 'one more game' becomes the 'one more turn' curse which has afflicted civilisation in the past!  Definitely worth a buy if you; like history; have a penchant for RTS; just want a good game!  Wolololo!! "
Once made a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of custom taunts for me an my friends.  Sent a petard rush at a computer civ spamming Jihadist screaming Allahu Akbar as a taunt.  Each game is two hours well spent.
I used to play The original game when I was younger so I thaught I would give this ago.  Im dreadful but that doesnt matter
10/10 would wololo again
"Enjoying the game, quite fun actualy    untill my shitfriend comes and assrape me.  9/10"
Just buy it.
"If you like the original AOEII, then you will definitely like this. It has all the goodness of the original plus a little more. There is not much else to say, if you have played the original you likely know what is good about this game. If you have not, then you may not want to bother.  The 'HD' part of this is not really all that accurate. It seems the graphics all not all that enchanced, not in any way that really matters. Though, it is still nice to see some better graphics.  "
I remembered playing this game growing up and then I found it on Steam and its the exact same as I rememered. Hours of entertainment.
"This is a great game, Ive been playing it since it originally came out but only recently got on steam and purchased it. Brings back fond memories of a simpler time when I could lan the day away with my brothers. If you like rts' this is the way to go, its one of the greats in the genre alongside the command and conquer series(pre red alert 3)"
"I''ve played this game since 2001, and over my 15 history with the game I have never regretted playing it or had an unhappy time playing it (ignoring the sore losers you get online, but thats every game). If you are into stragety games at all, I urge you to give this game a whirl, and if your a bit tired with RTS like SCII, then this game will reignite that interest for RTS games."
They shouldnt have spent the time ♥♥♥♥ing up the hotkeys and instead spent the time fixing whatever the hell is wrong with the AI and the multiplayer connection. Then they should have spent 500 bucks on a dedicated server that they could just leave in a closet to run the online mp.   TLDR: Lazy cash grab totally worked.   I now have bought this game three times in my life.   4/5 Stars would rebuy trash again apparently.
"It goes without saying that Age of Empires 2 is one of the greatest RTS games ever made. Timeless gameplay and graphics, the highly polished AoE2 offered endless hours of fun, whether you were online, offline, or working through it's extremely long campaigns.  Age of Empires II HD is a remake which, essentially, just gives the game a higher resolution and different looking cliffs. It's actually pretty crap - the resolution is great, but the cliffs are ugly as sin. They had also updated the appearance of farms, but wisely removed that particular embroidery when they realised that their new models looked disgusting. Moreover, they have taken the [pointless] step of replacing the 'slab of meat' food icon with a corn icon, but this only applies to the resource bar in the top left corner - villagers gathering berries still have a meat icon counter in their little info panels, and berrie bushes, animals and farms all still feature the meat icons in their information panels. Not only are the meat slab icons still present, they appear to have been hastily adapted to the new resolution, as their pixels clash with those of the information panel.  This is all pretty indicative of what's wrong with this game - incredibly skin-deep alterations that must have only taken a few days of work. All of that said, though, you should still get this game, because it retains the gameplay of the greatest RTS game I've ever played, and it comes with the campaign packs for both AoE2: Age of Kings and it's expansion, the superior 'Conquorers Expansion'."
Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!  This is a Real time strategy game.    Interface/Menu/Settings
"A good game great that it has been remastred but there is one problem I think with the architecture, The Byzantines did not build like turks and saracens so why are they in the muslim architecture group"
A visual update on a classic! This is definitely one of my favorite games to just kill time with.
"Came to it from age of mythology. Was really looking for something like stardew, rimworld, dont starve, etc. I'm a new gamer. I don't remember the classics, this is my first real computer, and my husband got me off my old n64 and outdated xbox, and got me into these games, then we moved backwards, and oh I like it so much more."
The best of the best! Great for the whole family!
"I enjoyed this game very thoroughly as a kid and I love it just as much as an adult. My step brother used to play this game for hours on end at night and into the morning, and I knw precisely why: Content.   You could play AoE forever and never get bored. It's the best, it's amazing, YOU SHOULD BUY IT TODAY. DO IT. I'M BILLY MAYS, BUY MY PRODUCT."
"Still feels like the old game while adding new civs. Considering there are new expansions once in a while and good online matchfinding, worth every penny."
Wololo
Still awesome after all these years.
"i dont know whats the problem but after your recent updates my game does not launch. it gives no messages and just does not launch, i click on the game icon it says launching aoe2 and then poof it doesn't launches, i do it hundreds of time but it does not launch, PLEASE help me figure this out cuz i love the game and i dont wanna get a refund just yet."
Converting to the dark side simulator 2016  Now in HD.
"This game is truely amazing. Even after having this game for years without steam, I still play it to this day.   - AMAZING GAME"
"Enjoying the game, quite fun actualy    untill my shitfriend comes and assrape me.  9/10"
"I remember back in 2006 when I was only about 5-6 years old, and I first sat on my dads lap as he played this game. I remember in game, I played a standard 1v1 game, blue vs. Red. I had 6 villagers after a short amount of time playing, and 4 of them were women. The game had seemed like so little at the time, but also such an amazing concept. Now, 10 year later, I play the game, and I still have the same joy I did as a young kid. I love this game and I would reccomend it to anyone who would like a real time strategy game, that has a beautiful plot to it, or in this case, many plots. You can go to the point of imagining your own plot like I did when I was younger. I still do it now, but that's besides the point. The game is absolutely beautiful, even in it's simplistic state.   10/10"
First game to come to mind for the test of time award. Still a great game after almost 20 years
"Timeless masterpiece. Gives you the same today as it did 15 years ago: Endless hours of fun.   Build and manage your own empire from scratch. Trace strategies to conquer or destroy your enemies. Play as a historic heroe in the single player campaings.   Pros: - Feel the thrill of triumphing over less advanced civilisations.  - Team with other players to bring mayhem and chaos upon the map. - Rebuild a whole empire with one single villager, 275 wood and 100 stone.  Cons: - Wololo!  :D"
"Nomination for best use of a farm animal. I had to pick something.   Blast from the past. Great game back in the day and still a great time waster today. The game runs fine with no crashes. I heard multiplayer is iffy but ehhh, I mostly play the single player now. The Age of Kings and Conquerors are still fun. The Forgotton expanision is alright, the AI is a littler more beefed up and sometimes spawns extra units which can drag the games on forever and you can tell the Forgotton was written by modders and not professions. Haven't played Africans"
Rome has fallen and the world is up for grabs!  Gets my test of time award.
This should get the 'test of time' award. Even today it is enjoyable to play :)
"This is my first RTS game. The most satisfying part of this game is when my lumberjacks platoon exterminate the forests in the entire map, one by one...chop chop chop!  The negative is, framerate drop occur frequently just like the other reviewers say. I set aside that problem for nostalgic reasons =)  This game should win the The 'Test of Time' Award!"
Just like when i was a child
Still as fun as the first day I played it over a decade ago (the original that is)
Still as fun as the first day I played it over a decade ago (the original that is)
"Some games never grow old, Age of Empires 2 is one of them. Alongside Heroes of Might and Magic 3 it's one of my most-played strategy games. I currently own two physical copies, and this version on Steam, and I can't do anything but recommend it."
Playing bongo music by clicking on house i member
Great game
"Best old standby ever. Played it when it first came out. Bought multiple replacement disks. Bought again through Steam (no more disks!), still playing even now. Best way to chill and play with friends from far away. Thank god for the Forgotten dev team for their mod and then the official expansion."
One word: nostalgic!
Is a great game to come back to and play with friends and have fun.
Fantastic game and so glad I can play it again. Do still have the disc its jsut a shame that stopped being compatiable. Only game I will never tire of playing.
I love this game tooo much!!! &lt;3
I love this game tooo much!!! &lt;3
"I grew up playing this game and I've loved it ever since. Easily one of the best RTS games ever made, Multiplayer with friends are as fun as ever."
Best game tbh fam
"Patch 4.8 is looking promising. Get it after patch 4.8 releases from beta and reading feedback. Get it for the campaigns and the shinier graphics. If you want better competitive MP or access to a much larger library of custom scenarios, stick with the original game+Voobly."
Game of my childhood! 10/10
"This game will always be fun, played the original game when it came out and made me had so much fun. Its a great way to get into the RTS dying genre and have a lot of fun playing with historical characters"
"I first bought this game back at the start of 2000. It was the first game I owned, and I bought it because I had loved playing AOE1 when I visited my friends, and it wasn't available at the time.   So I bought this one instead. And I have never looked back! The mechanics are simple enough to be understood and managed by a new player, but complex enough that you can still find ways to enhance your chances of winning even against experienced opponents.  The HD Edition more than lives up to the reputation of the original release, and I love the new civs the two newest expansions have added as well. The campaigns both new and old are still worth playing, and the entire game has stood up surprisingly well over time.  My only concessions are that there are a few annoying glitches with this version; notably with a couple of Achievements (If that matters to you) and nostalgia dictates that I prefer the old cliffs and fire animations. Thankfully, this game also has a very active and vibrant mod community, so the workshop can help you find anything you like to restore the game to a classic, new millenium feel.  Seriously, I can't recommend this game highly enough! If you like strategy games and haven't played this, you are seriously missing out."
"This is my favorite RTS of all time, even today it still hold a lot of nostolgia to when i was younger and would play LAN parties with friends whenever we visited. It is awesome to see that new content is still being added (albeit slow) and it makes it worth buying on steam, even though i still have the origional CD-ROM expansions.  A great classic and worth buying/trying out."
"If you liked AoE II, you will love this. Basically the same stuff but not in 400x600 and with more civilisations and units. Just buy it already."
"gud game, get it, a must-have for every steam user!"
"Still a great game that'll have you rolling down that river of nostalgia. The new expansions are great for anyone interested in competative polay and balancing, but the original still stands strong on its own.  The AI will keep you on your toes for good practice and use all the tactics you hate to fight and give you all but the hardest challenge, for that try hitting the ranked games and trying out your mettle."
I like destroying farms with a sword 10/10
"A very nostalgic game which encompasses both raw entertainment and strategic ability, and is overall a great way to spend some time for any avid RTS player, or with some friends who love to burn down all your villagers."
This game is still as good as it was when it came out. and i did enyoy so musch. :)
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with an HD remake filled to the brim with content. With eight campaigns, a robust multiplayer, Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price of admission."
"Your staple lan party/multiplayer game, you can't go wrong with this one."
"Definitely the best of the three in my opinion. played over 2000 hours non-steam, then i discovered the steam version on one of my friends account as he was playing it. looked good, i bought it, i tried it, i liked it. i played the third one but i will always go back to this.  This, is a classic.  Hence why i nominated.  GR"
It's still same old good game but with better textures and no problems with running on modern pc
"If you liked AoE II, you will love this. Basically the same stuff but not in 400x600 and with more civilisations and units. Just buy it already."

The AI will keep you on your toes for good practice and use all the tactics you hate to fight and give you all but the hardest challenge, for that try hitting the ranked games and trying out your mettle."
I like destroying farms with a sword 10/10
"A very nostalgic game which encompasses both raw entertainment and strategic ability, and is overall a great way to spend some time for any avid RTS player, or with some friends who love to burn down all your villagers."
This game is still as good as it was when it came out. and i did enyoy so musch. :)
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with an HD remake filled to the brim with content. With eight campaigns, a robust multiplayer, Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price of admission."
"Your staple lan party/multiplayer game, you can't go wrong with this one."
"Definitely the best of the three in my opinion. played over 2000 hours non-steam, then i discovered the steam version on one of my friends account as he was playing it. looked good, i bought it, i tried it, i liked it. i played the third one but i will always go back to this.  This, is a classic.  Hence why i nominated.  GR"

"The best rts of its time, and it is still fun! Well worth your money, despite any problems it may have. Bug fixes and new content still being developed!"
:)
Still good after all this time...
Since I was 4.   Still lovin' it &lt;3
Great fun to play with friends
"This game is simply amazing, can get fairly boring alone but if you play with some friends..."
This is a very good classic game that can run well on pretty much any machine. Especially on sale it's a steal.  8/10
"Exciting and stressful, it's a race to get to the paramount age and still have all the resources required to maintain your town centre.. Not to mention the constant distraction of enemies knocking down your walls. A must-have."
Age of Empires II is an testment of real time strategy game design.
"This is a classic I go back to when I want some dominating good strategy fun. I've been quite backlogged in my queue of more recent games, but I occasionally get the urge to play this one still."
greatest game of all time
"After so many years since I last played this (still has the CD-ROM for the Gold Edition), it is good to play it again.  Perhaps the best RTS game in all history."
It's ok.
A classic. One of the best.
"Because this game came out in 1999, I can truly say:  WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE!?  This game is amazing!! Don't be afraid that after 17 years this game no longer has updates or players, because it does! The most recent update was YESTERDAY as of now."
I approve of this game.
One of the classic RTS games.
Best Classic Game Of All Time!
Try and make a better RTS. I dare you.
I may not have a million hours on this game but I have played Age of Empires one and two since I was a child. Nothing beats the classic feel of this RTS. More game modes and maps than ever. This game is hands down a classic that will always will remain on speed dial in my library.  Only one down side of this version is that there is no LAN support.  I still rate this game 10/10.
"Honestly, I've had so many great experiences with this game. I love the strategy involved with micro managing your economy, army, and trade. It's just very detailed I guess."
Excellent RTS! Many thanks for this!
"One of my Childhood games, it is soo much fun when you get a couple of your friends around for a full out war between, CIVs, never going to forget those days, and now it can happen even more."
"Good game, come back and play it with friends from time to time."
"Very solid game, play with your friends, or wallow in your self pity and play by yourself!  10/10 would make the women do all the hard work again."
I've either played this game long enough for me to hate my friends... ...or my friends to hate me. 11/10 better relationship building than Mario Party
"Even after all these years, this game is still amazing!!"
One of the greatest rts games ever created.
.
The only game for the 'Test Of Time' award
"The game of my childhood, the game of my younghood, the game of my adulthood. Roses are red. Wololo Roses are blue"
"Probaly one of the best RTS games ever made. Love to revisit it every now and then, and the creation of the HD version means I can continue to play it over and over again!  Still waiting for Age 4 ;)"
Shout out to Steam Support for replying to my help comment in a couple hours and fixed this amazing game when I couldnt get it to work
Best RTS on Steam.
"While (minus the expansions) only a graphical update of the orignal game, it still has not lost its appeal, and the expansions only add to that. I would recommend this to anyone who never played the original, or if you are looking to still play online with friends."
"only an hour playing and I'm already in love, It's like the classic AoE ... but better"
Old but Gold
"Super simple, Super fun, Super everything. I played this before the HD remake and MAN was it fun."
Works great on Windows 10 and a must-have classic for those Age of Empires fans. Also tons of new content to explore.
Just nominated this for the test of time award.
Just an awesome trip to memory lane...
"Just nominated for the test of time award. I mean, this game is 17 years old ... and it was, it is and it will always be one of my favorites real time strategy games of mine."
It's ok.
Timeless and fun!
Old but Gold.
I nominated this game for a 'Test of Time' award. I remember playing this game as a young lad and im glad that I can comeback to this game now :D. This is worth every singe € in your pocket.
"One of the best RTS game that truly belongs into your old but gold gaming library section uncountable hours of fun  shall it be either singleplayer or multiplayer,  and of course there are tons of mods just waiting to be played the same thing with custom made campaigns,  playing them online is also not a problem, it also has a competitive community ( an online ranking system ) if you are into that many also play it on voobly were you might find some of the old vets still  participating in tournaments .  "
"One of the best platformers of all time, on par with other great names like GTA: San Andreas or Gran Turismo 2."
"I remember being recommended Age of Empires II when I was 10 years old at a local Video Games store.  I still play it today, over 15 years later."
I don't like this game wolololo Buy this game 10/10
"Age Of Empires 2  This game is one of the best games ever, it may seem like i dont have a lot of hours in this game, but i have played this game so much while i was offline that i have lost count.I would always recommend this game to anyone if they asked me for a good game to skip time and that wasnt bad, if i would choose the best RTS game ever, i would have a hard choice between Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires 2....   I´d probably choose Age Of Empires 2 though!"

"This was the first game I remember playing, with this I learnt a lot. I was around 4 when I first played it, so I learnt not only about history but also, for example, a lot of vocabulary, among many other things (the basics os strategy, economy, etc.). It got me into gaming. I have the original Gold Edition with the Conquerors expansion (the physical CD) but I bought this so that I could play online. I'm glad to know there's still a big community of gamers playing it. This game is a legend."
"You might cry, you might get angry, you might be frustrated, you might be happy. This game is a land of different feelings. Its amazing how a game can age so well and still today it has replay value. This is a feature that only a FEW games of this '2010 and up era' has. Once you get on Age of Empires with friends the level of fun goes WAY beyond these AAA games we have today. The game is old school and easy to learn but hard to master. I have 105 hours of gametime at the time of writing this and I am a rookie still. I dont know the best tactic to play the game with. I only know the basics. With this and a huge replay value, you get a game which is worth every single penny. I got this on sale for 5€! I spent 50€ on Grand Theft Auto V and I still enjoy this more! I was really young when I tried the original AOE 2 for the first time, so this might be a game which doesnt attract today's 12-15 year olds.   But anyone who is considering whether to buy this or not for 5€, BUY IT!! You will not regret it one bit.   :wololo:"
Ive played this game since day one and love every bit of it
"An amazingly good game, even now it's competing with the modern games. You've got to think or you'll never outmatch even a normal AI, and the multiplayer is seriously tense with the early stages really affecting the outcome of the match! I always enjoy this game, and wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, it's always installed on my computer just in case my friends and I want a bit of great action nostalgia!"
"good game, but my friends suck at it so its too easy"
&gt;Play 6 player FFA with friends &gt;Get roflstomped by mass cavalery because you arent so good &gt;Notice that only thing remeaning for you are 2 cannon galeons and some war galleys &gt;Proceed with being a ♥♥♥♥ to everyone from water &gt;Lose friends because of me being an ♥♥♥♥ for next 15 minutes.  10/10 would repeat again.
This game has been around since 1999 and it's still better than most rts' on the market
Old but Gold &lt;3
"One of the best RTS games ever made. Fantastic gameplay that's easy to learn and hard to master. Single player campaigns are well done and will take tens of hours in total to complete. Random map and powerful scenario editor (now with Steam workshop support) provide never-ending source of fun. I generally avoid multi-player but even I had some fun playing with friends. We encountered some hiccups at the time of release with 6+ players and population limit set to 500 but I presume that should be fixed by now.  The HD version is updated to work on modern computers and it's continuously supported even 3.5 years after its release on Steam. It runs beautifully on any basically any PC and resolution that I tried. The graphics, music and sounds are all timeless. I also appreciate the additional maps, game modes and plethora of mostly small improvements (e.g. extension of maximum population limit from 200 to 500). And if you don't like some of the changes, you can usually find a mod on workshop that changes it to the original (I personally use mod that replaces the food resource icon with the old one)."
"Best game ever, since my childhood to present, this hasn't failed to entertain me"
"Great fun to play with friends against AI, also great for losing friends by playing against them.  Good replayability too thanks to the wide selection of playable civilizations- each with their own strengths and weaknesses- encouraging exploration of new strategies each game.  Reviewing review for a badge c:"
Wolololo simulator  10/10  Would wololo again :D
"Although I may be biased torwards this game due to playing it throughout my young childhood, this game is definitely up there in the best of all time. It implements some of the strongest fast paced rts mechanics through early, mid, and late game. There is not a single moment to be completely idle, it is filled with non-stop action. The art style might not be for new players being introduced to it today, but I still highly recommend this PC gem of a game."
"In a word, nostalgic. As great a game today as when it came out all those years ago. Remember playing it for hours with my friends and havinng one hell of a time. Age of Empires II is simply amazing. Couldn't notice much HD, but what a hell, it's worth every cent. Best strategy game i've ever played."

"I am awful at this game, but I could still play it forever."
I consider this AoE II to be the worldwide staple of all real time strategy games.
"Always wanted to go back and play this game but the multiplayer syncing issues from the original made it unplayable. With this, not only does the game look pleasing but I can enjoy this gem with buddies online again."
An old game yet still amazing to play.
Timeless classic. Way easier to set up a multiplayer game than the previous version. Highly recommended.
"Played this A0EII since it first came out (still got the original cds for AoE Gold, AoE2 and the expansions).  definitely one of the best RTS to be made that isn't part of the CnC world.   Challenging enough to force you to sometimes resort to cheats out of frustration, but always fun."
"It's been well over 10 years since I first played the original version of this game, and it's still one of the best (if not THE best) RTS I've ever played. Additionally, the HD version is one of better modernization remakes I've seen, with full Steam matchmaking integration."
Awesome game! I loved playing this as a kid and its still fun
Great Game!
"  i can not recommend this game enough, essphally if you have someone to play with. it is SO MUCH FUN. how fun? fun enough that my family bought and wore out three or four or possably five copys on disk before getting it on steam, because we played it THAT MUCH. it is a wonderfully made stratigy game, with many many differing civs to choose from, and is still fun. AI's too easy? get some friends together and FIGHT. it'll be a blast. :)  I know this dosn't look at pro's and con's, but really i feel like the amount of time i've spent playing it speaks louder then i can. too bad i can't add time spent on it before i got steam.."
"A very nostalgic game which encompasses both raw entertainment and strategic ability, and is overall a great way to spend some time for any avid RTS player, or with some friends who love to burn down all your villagers."
"Still a great game that'll have you rolling down that river of nostalgia.

"A classic, reimagined in HD.      Just kidding, I got it because it was higher res and you can see more. Still great though!"
This game is still as good as it was when it came out. and i did enyoy so musch. :)
I like destroying farms with a sword 10/10
It's still same old good game but with better textures and no problems with running on modern pc
Old but Gold &lt;3
A fun Game and Stratigic. Good for Multiplayer games and parties.
"Age of empires 2 is a game everyone should play at least once in their lifetime. This is how we did it in the early 2000's boys, and it's still just as good today as it was back then. LAN Party!"
"Been playing AOE I and II since I was young. I never get sick of the game, there are constant challenges and improvements to be make in your skills. All of this added content is a huge bonus!"
"So where do I start with this review? I think the majority of us older gamers will remember Age of Empires from late 1999 or early 2000. I first played Age of Empires in the late 2002's and early 2003's (curtsy to my cousin who is old enough to be my father for introducing me to this game). I could play this game before I could even read or write, I watched my elder siblings play this game and learnt from them how to do everything.  So as you can tell, this game was one of the first games I ever played and it was the game that really got me into gaming in the first place. I still have my original copy, another copy I picked up for £7 in Morrison's one time in 2008 with the expansion packs.   Let's get properly into the jucy bit of this review. This game is fantastically done but to call it 'HD edition' is misleading as it is hardly high definition, they just scaled up the textures and possibly changed the water textures. I can't thing of any other negatives though. I can loose my self in this game for hours and still not want to leave the screen for one second, the competitiveness of this game between empires is crazy (especially on hardest AI settings). The game also works similar to real life, you all have your resources, some have more of one than another, and you can sell or buy resources (like importing and exporting) and have your own supply. It's also interesting how the AI can launch an attack on you when you haven't even started to gather an army and can just wipe out your empire in less than 20mins into that specific game.  In my expierence if you play islands death match large (8players) the best way to go about an invasion is first of by building up a decent size navy and attack from the seas first and then transport your troops to low concentrated area and then have a battle on land between land based troops.  I wouldn't recomend this game to people who don't enjoy games that require a fair bit of patience though, that being said I think that this has to be the best RTS game I have ever played."
this game is good.
"Wew, buy... GREAT WITH FRIENDS. Strategy game for NERDS. :D WE ARE ALL NERDS."
"this game is one of my childhood favorites, i DEFENETLY recomend it."
"Probably one of my favorite games and my friends got this for me on a whim. The game takes a lot of practice, but the battles are nontheless satisfying. I usually don't realize that I've delved an hour or two into a really big game.   This is the kind of game you and your friends may play for fun together, but end up getting really competitive."
still an amazing game after 17 years ^^
Still holds up after all these years.
I get way to serious with this game
Great to see this game still being played in this day and age. Also nice to see that there are devlopers still devoted to keeping the game in shape. Hope AOE stays strong and lives the test of time.
awesome game and childhood love 10/10
its a classic that's still fun years down the line + its like $10
This is a beautiful remaster of an absolute classic from so many peoples childhoods. How can you go wrong?
"Having first played this game as a child many years ago I was delighted when I heard that it was to be released through Steam. This enabled me to play the game hassle free without messing around with 15 year old discs and relive the joy of taking the mighty Aztecs (or Persians, Teutons, Goths, Byzantines, Vikings etc....) through the ages. Having lacked an internet connection when it was first released (yes, the game is that old!) this rerelease also introduced me to multiplayer for the first time adding many hours of replay value - and that's before mentioning that expansions are still being released for a game that debuted last century! Great game, still the king of RTS after all these years."
"I have an Age of Empires 2, I have a HD version on Steam, Uh! Age of Empires 2 HD on Steam!  I have Multiplayer, I have Mods, Uh! Multiplayer and Mods!  Age of Empires 2 HD on Steam, Multiplayer and Mods, ...Uh! Age of Empires 2 HD on Steam with Multiplayer and Mods.  Age of Empires 2 HD on Steam with Multiplayer and Mods."
After so many years it still remains one of the classic and best strategy games out there.

"Awesome Stratgy game I played since my childhood , And NEW HD wooooooow"
Large learning curve but highly recommend.
"Absolutely awesome game even if u didnt play it as a kid, its so much fun and its really really hard. Time and effort is the only key to getting remotely ♥♥♥♥ing good XD 200 hrs and i still stand no chance against anyone other then my friends"
"Still feels like the old game while adding new civs. Considering there are new expansions once in a while and good online matchfinding, worth every penny."
Still awesome after all these years.
Converting to the dark side simulator 2016  Now in HD.
"i dont know whats the problem but after your recent updates my game does not launch. it gives no messages and just does not launch, i click on the game icon it says launching aoe2 and then poof it doesn't launches, i do it hundreds of time but it does not launch, PLEASE help me figure this out cuz i love the game and i dont wanna get a refund just yet."
"This game is truely amazing. Even after having this game for years without steam, I still play it to this day.   - AMAZING GAME"
"great game, but it really ticks me off that with windows 10, microsoft doesnt left you play the old disc version of this game (and many others) so you have to buy this version, but it is still the same great game i used to play before"
Bought this game few years ago to play with my friends and now we play each holiday One of the best games to play against your friends
best ever game. and that hd water is cool
"Wanted to be an emperor, ended up as a monk. Wololo!"
Is there any downside to this game? .. Hmm ... I think not... (Only stone stealin fukerhedz like Lineh)
"I first played this game back in 2002 when I had my first tower-pc at the age of 12. I have happily owned the HD version from the moment I found it on the steam store page. This game is nominated for the 'Test of Time' Award mainly because of the community and additional gameplay that goes along with it.  The workshop is nothing like I have ever seen before. From people editing a whole civilisation to bring you ROMANS to additional maps and mods like Jurassic Park/Hunger Games mash up. The people are and have always been willing to add their own ingenuity to this game that really keeps people coming back to this game over and over. The maps get smarter, and the players get new and exciting ways to challenge their opponents.  There is a major problem with desyncing when using certain mods, and your friends will all have to have exactly the same mods active as you to immerse yourself in a multiplayer; but who cares! For the most part, it works gloriously, and I can wreck havoc with my Roman Legionnaires or my beloved War Elephants. As computers have grown and evolved, it has really helped with online gameplay, and we can increase the population size using mods to make the game last even longer than previously anticipated in the games first release. If you've got the internet speed, and the processing speed, then you're going to have a glorious time with the 'Unlimited Population' mod. #justsayin'.  This game definitely deserves to win the Test of Time Award, for being a 17 year old game that we all play not just for nostalgia, but because the strategies keep on adapting!"
great game
"I remember playing this on my brother's Windows 98 PC many many years ago, I had more hours in this game than I have in Rocket League now. As a veteran of the original I can testify that The HD Steam version does the original more than justice, everything thing is there and I had a nostalgia trip for hours when I first got this. If you're a fan of classic RTS, resource management sims, GET THIS GAME. The workshop support and continued release of expansions adds even more to this amazing classic title."
This is one of the 'test of time' awards for sure. It is amazing how after all this time this is STILL a good game and definitively a game to come back to. Any RTS-fan should at least have tried this game.
very great game wololo
The memories....
"Game works great, lots of childhood memmories &lt;3"
"very fun and maybe even nostalgic for some!  *update* Had this game for a week now, I am addicted... send help."
"Awesome, will sometimes play online with friends, HUGE fan of the Age of empires series, and this is thee best one yet 10/10"
Great remaster. works well.   If you loved AoE 2 grab this.
"Still amazing 17 years later, and STILL getting supported. If you love RTS games check this one out!"
reliving my childhood as never been more fun
One of the best RTS games I have ever played. Perfect 10/10
"Excellent game, takes me back to when i first played it! HD really adds to the game."
"This game was once released back in the late 90's, while I was a bit too young to really appreciate it when it first came out, I eventually got it as one of those Wal-mart packages for $10 that came with AoE I and II. After playing it for ~100 hours or so while growing up, the pc I was using began to bite the dust while playing the old AoE II (came with conqurors) messing up many things including the textures on the ground. I was saddened for a while...  Until I discovered it was on steam for $20 (got it while it was on sale for $5) and began to enjoy it all over again. I can say that when I first got it (HD rerelease) the AI plus the music overhaul were to be getting used to. I continued to play it a bit more until I had enough to afford the first dlc, then any other new dlc were bought within a week of release.  Gameplay wise, it is a classic. While the online battles are more than challenging, the bot battles are also enjoyable. You gather resources to boost your township up, building buildings and troops to beat any foes. The basic premise of the game is very simple to understand and yet difficult to master. For some games can last mere minutes if they know what they are doing vs Hours. Not only that but most civilizations are unique in their playstyle, not the cookie cutter others might have.  Cons, while it might say HD, the graphics are not the crisp and clean ultra 4k resolution many people have come to expect in many modern games more being a graphical slight upgrade on the textures. Also the AI goes through phases. Before the recent patch/dlc the AI was a little dull but the recent patch really put me on my toes.  The community, as far as I am aware, is very welcoming to any new novices wanting to learn the ins and outs of the game. A great community is what really makes a multiplayer experience stand out. So if you want to expand your knowledge, the community is willing to help out.  This game has withstood the test of time. Comparing the other Age of Empires games, AoE 2 still gets updates nearly 20 years later. VERY few games can have that honor of support for such a long time. A cult classic that still gets updates. 10/10 would experience nostalgia again... BRB going to get more nostalgia!"
"One of the greatest games of all time, never fails to entertain me"
he'll yeah. . . True Game For All The True Gamers Out There
Why not?
I missed to play this game ! and now I can play it in windows 10 !!! I can't stop playing this game !
Still one of the all-time greatest RTS games. A true classic in every way.
This is one of the best old school games. Created with finess and class. Another game like this need to be made.
"nice strategy game, pretty micro intensive"
highly recommend.
"Great to play this classic again, remember back in the days all my classmates played it as well when we came home from school. Great memories!"
Turtle all the way.
As good as it always was
great game
My favourite game. been playing it for as long as my memory allows. it is the best of its kind. but still could be better. autosave or should say lack of is very frustrating... its a game that you immerse yourself into so saving it isnt at the forefront of you conquering mind.and on the expansion or extention packs like the forgotten campaigns there are no voice overlay which is frustrating as some worded sections take forever and some are too quick. annoyingly simple things to be the best game ever.
"Clasic RTS  This is probably one of the best clasic RTS, one of the games that made the builder games what they are today. If your expecting any modern graphics im sorry but your looking in the wrong place.   I would recommend this game for anyone wanting to go back the the original RTS roots or for those who want to see where it all started.   if you are looking at this game there is a good chance you already know what it is. Go get it and swim in nastalga for a bit"
I love that &lt;3
It teaches you strategy and a great way to make your brain work.
"The far south-eastern empire which passed and won the most number of war in the ancien world, the impressing Thailand's and breath-taking Cambodian achitecture, the valiant and deathly warrior of the aborigines so-called Māori ... and are their story too short to write at the history of the world? NO, so where is these dumb things hiding from my AoE II game?  Hope there will soon be a DLC for South-East Asian and Oceanian Civilizations ... after that, worth 10/10"
Love this game! I grew up on Age of empires and really got into PC gaming because of games like this. I was sad when my copy wouldnt work on my newer platform as well as i remembered. So finding the HD version and with extra content. Hell Yeah! Definitely a must own!
"Grew up playing this game, felt incredibly nostalgic buying the HD version... Still a great game, I recommend to everyone!"
"An absolute classic of the Genre, Age of Empires II holds up as a staple of Real-Time Strategy. The factions are all balanced out with historic focuses allowing you to synergize a solid strategy or come up with your own on the fly. Plus with team bonuses you can work with your allies to create the kind of game you want to play. The scenario editor is simple, fun, and great for designing scenarios, campaigns, and even just random battles of war and violence.  Plus you can play as the Vikings, build about sixty Elite Longboats, three Transports, and sixty Elite Berserks with full upgrades, load everybody in the boats, sail over to your enemy, and watch your hoard of regenerating axe-swingers maul their way through the enemy's main camp taking little to no real losses. Unless their playing Japan. Or have massed Onagers. Damn Scots."
epic! buy it
It's aged remarkably well.
Just opening up the game brings back fond memories. Glad that they bought this old bird back to life!
"Same Age of Empires 2 everybody absolutely loves, well I do anyway.."
Very good game  Would recommend to a new steam player
Nostalgia. Introducing your friends for the first time and destroying them is so much fun.
Definitely my favorite when it comes to strategy games. I play AOE since I was 9 years old and I still love. I also learned a lot about history due to Age Of Empires :p
"Excellent game, takes me back to when i first played it! HD really adds to the game."
"I love this game! It is just what I remember when I played the original, with very minor exceptions and additions of course.   My only gripe, one cannot change the screen resolution within the game. It takes default from one's computer monitor resolution. Terribly annoying as I have a 15', 4K screen....so it is merely a matter of changing my resolution before I start the game and problem solved. If don't, my troops are the size of a pinhead, at most, two pinheads. This minor gripe does not affect my review of the game!  "
I love this game so much
Lost my entire city took 40 villagers and built a wonder in the corner of the map and won the game 10/10
"This game deserves an introduction before review. A short story, perhaps? A novel?  Age of Empires II HD One of the dearest games that reside forever, undying, unending, deepest within my heart of hearts. I have played this game since I was a kid, and it struck an untouched chord in my heart that never ceased to hum. The graphics, the sounds, the playstyle, the ease of navigating, the helpful text when hovering over an icon. Everything is its own ingredient in the recipe for perfection. The recipe for Age of Empires II HD (and non-HD for that matter) Nothing takes me back quite like this one does.  Likes: Navigation made to perfection. Toolbars made to perfection. Tips made to perfection. Custom maps and campaigns made to perfection. Sounds made to perfection. Graphics made to perfection. Everything made to perfection. Perfection. This.game.is.perfection!  Dislikes: You have to have a computer in order to play it. It does not run on thin air.  In total: PERFECTION!!!"
"A cataphract, a samurai and a teutonic knight go on speed dating. Who dates who? The cataphract dates the samurai, cause the TK is late."
"Ah AoE II, one of my favourite games during my childhood along with rollercoaster tycoon 2 and starcraft brood war. 10/10 would go back to being a child during that time again."
It's bery gud
Really good support After all these years
"What an epic game... This is a proper RTS, with amazing balance and character. I spent many hours playing the original game when it was released back in 1999. This game is definitely one of the best RTS games that was ever released and is a must if you have even a single strategy bone in your body, or if you are looking for a fun and captivating game. There is a huge added bonus if you are interested in medieval history…"
"This game is great. Unlike most popular RTS games from Blizzard, which emphasizes more on micromanagement or the hero than macro and only requires harvesting two different types of resources, in the Age of Empires series, one has to deal with four types of resources and there are different ways of acquiring them. In Blizzard RTS games one sees combat with their opponent much sooner whereas in Age of Empires I &amp; II, the average timing for the first tier occurs roughly at about 12-13 minutes, 15-16 minutes for the second tier, and roughly around 28-30 minutes for the third. This really depends on whether or not the player rushes or booms.  This series stands out simply because each map type is unique so players are expected to be more alert and adapt to their situation, where Blizzard's games have the exact same map.  In AoE2, there are 13 civilizations, each with it's own unique characteristics, hence build order. To be good at RM or DM, you will need to know, not only the build order for that civlization, but how to counter the strengths and exploit weaknesses against your opponents civilization.  There are limitations to the HD version on steam in that the game lobby is still based on the original concept and the player statistics aren't well recorded. However, one can simply download the compatibility patch to play on  Voobly.com  which offers a more competitive environment and more!"

Nice town...I'll take it.
AOE2 is a timeless classic and should be played by everyone ever
epic! buy it
It's aged remarkably well.
Childhood game...i love it even now!!! Recommend this game
"Aw, this is one of the first PC games I fell in love with! I remember playing this many years ago with my parents and siblings - We all loved it. It really brings back the nice memories, and it is just as enjoyable as it was then!  All in all it's a nice stragedy game and I really recommend it!!"

"  Played this game since I was 12, It was my first Age Of Empire game I ever played. The graphics and everything are still beautiful to me even to this day, I wouldn't change a thing in this game. The other DLCS to this pack are perfection as-well and all the other games from the same company are amazing. This is the kinda game you need on a sunday day while snuggled up in blankets and a tea beside you - The games can last a while in singleplayer or multiplayer. I wouldn't change a thing about this game.  If you aren't happy with the main game, you can always add MODS now to the game to change up, but I wouldn't bother. ♥"
"I used to only be able to build 40 houses, but now I can build 100.  10/10"
Amazing! It still holds up. Totally recommended.
Just like i remember it. The good ol days back in the early 2000s. Beautiful.
I love this game since i was a kide ♥
"I've played Age of Empires back when it didn't have any DLC, nor the HD version. I had the original CD, but since it broke, I bought this version. And I could not be any happier, than what I am right now.  I love Age of Empires and I will continue to support this game, till the end."
Just opening up the game brings back fond memories. Glad that they bought this old bird back to life!
"Same Age of Empires 2 everybody absolutely loves, well I do anyway.."
Very good game  Would recommend to a new steam player
"Friend: What game should I get on the steam sa- Me: Get aoe2hd Friend: Why is it good? Me: ಠ_ಠ Friend: Like what featur- Me: ಠ_ಠ   Seriously fun gameplay and an incredible amount of replayability much, much beyond its price point."
Wololo
You will need more Viligers
"2005. At age 11, the day of my birthday my mom comes home with Age of Empires II. I was so excited I didn't even realize The Conqouers expansion was included ! I lost my mind. It was a treasure that I still have on disk somewhere. AOE II was my childhood. AOE I and even III were amazing. But AOE II was the embodiement of joy any game could give me. It will hold up forever if you ask me. Hours of fun, strategy for days. You will get caught up with the expansions and it will over take your mind. When you catch your self thinking about strats in multiplayer and single player alike, you will love it !"
"Although it may seem I've only played this game a few hours, I've been playin since It was 7 years-old or so. I have countless hours on it, and I can proudly say it is my favourite game EVER. With the new expansions, the FE team has kept the game alive and fresh, when other have decayed, taking it to a new level, with up to 9 new civs and huge new chunks of strategies with all the DLC's. It would be crazy to say this game isn't GREAT. 11/10 would command again any civ ever. Get it as fast as you can. Congrats to the FE team for it's commitment with this legendary game."
Nothing's changed from the last time I had it on CD.  Not like that's a bad thing. Can't wait to get the DLC.
"Developers,  After the most recent update, the multiplayer servers are extremely difficult to play on. Previously, I could play a relatively stable game despite players' bad pings. Now, if there is high latency between two players, even if their pings aren't bad for me, the game stops and desyncs.  Please try to diagnose and fix the problem as soon as possible.  Thanks!"

My favourite game. been playing it for as long as my memory allows. it is the best of its kind. but still could be better. autosave or should say lack of is very frustrating... its a game that you immerse yourself into so saving it isnt at the forefront of you conquering mind.and on the expansion or extention packs like the forgotten campaigns there are no voice overlay which is frustrating as some worded sections take forever and some are too quick. annoyingly simple things to be the best game ever.

Best strategy game
"Still a great game.  Multiplayer is still alive, and still fun."
"The hallmark of RTS gets a spectacular makeover. The size of the units could have been bigger, but the water has been very well remade and the audio seems to flow more superflously. This edition of AOE 2 adds some interesting new elements in the forms of the African Kingdoms and the Asian Dynasties. Many civilizations were playable before, but these two expansion packs complete the whole puzzle of a game that paved the way for the current strategy games as we know them. The instant build cheat makes the game fun to play and the code to gain ten thousand resources of all kinds offers many ways to attack the enemy, while creating an impregnable turtle shell around your castle.  Only the stories are very encyclopedic and the characters are forgettable. The voice-overs are decent, but act as storytellers that will educate you about key historical events without really bringing to life the people involved in the various campaigns."
"It's Age of Empires 2 with fancy eye candy graphics. Everything works as you would expect. They didn't change the main menu theme so uh, yeh it's pretty good."
It hasn't changed one bit over the years. Still the same old school RTS feel that it used to have.   I also haven't changed over the years and I still suck at it.
"Highly over-priced for a game that is heading towards 15 years old. 'HD' doesn't really add anything to the game. One notable thing is the flames on buildings and a few more civilisations; however. Also, it allows Steam workshop so you can download better textures to make it look better.  There are still lots of issues with the game, including the old favourite 'out of sync'. Anyway, I was prepared to pay full price for this, merely so that I could play multiplayer with my friends again after all these years.  Don't expect anything special from the HD version, and honestly I think that AOEIII is much better, but a classic is a classic and for as long as there is a community of gamers playing it, I'll be playing it too."
"Classic game, worth buying and never gets old."
"I've put 2 days of playtime into this game already in little over a month, so I'll put my thoughts out there.   Age of Empires 2 is a magnificent RTS game, my personal favourite. I would reccomend it in a heartbeat however this is of course the steam version, hence I will concerntrate on what the steam version offers, seeing as you could just buy a disc copy off amazon for £5.  First, the multiplayer support. Whilst in its current state it isn't all it could be, it is perfectly fine for matches with friends. No LAN however so this isn't suitible for LAN parties. Before the steam version I'd have never been able to play with most of my firends; now I played numerous matches &amp; had tonnes of fun.  Second, workshop support. This has allowed for some really neat custom maps, scenarios &amp; texture packs. The original game was moddable but this has revived the modding scene for this game, at least for now.  As for the HD part, theres no point in buying it for that. It looks the same for the most part, with some nicer water. To its credit though, it does now support modern screen resolutions which is a big plus. Some people don't like the new textures for farms, cliffs etc, but thanks to steam workshop they can be modded to be like the original or into something new.  There are achievements, records of your playtime &amp; other standard steam accessories. They're nothing special but they don't hinder the game in anyway, and if you like achievements, or knowing how much time you've played the game they are neat functions.  My conclusion: If you're wanting it for LAN gaming, don't bother but otherwise it is very much worth getting."
"The classic Age Of Empires 2, now in HD! Actually the HD simply refers to the fact that it can be run in higher resolutions than before, there's little-to-no graphics improvements. However, if you're like me and believe there is more to gaming than graphics then this is simply an essential purchase, since when it comes to strategy gaming, this has it all. If you really want improved graphics etc. then there are plenty to choose from within the Steam AOE2 community, making just as much an essential purchase for strategy games graphics ♥♥♥♥♥s as it is for strategy game purists..."
It teaches you strategy and a great way to make your brain work.
"The far south-eastern empire which passed and won the most number of war in the ancien world, the impressing Thailand's and breath-taking Cambodian achitecture, the valiant and deathly warrior of the aborigines so-called Māori ... and are their story too short to write at the history of the world? NO, so where is these dumb things hiding from my AoE II game?  Hope there will soon be a DLC for South-East Asian and Oceanian Civilizations ... after that, worth 10/10"
Its as good if not better than the original buy it now
8/8
"Age of empires ll was one of the games that i played the most in my childhood. And now that i have grown up i can't stop playing the HD version. Buy it, i know you will hate the online as much as i do."
My boats got converted to Christianity.  10/10 would Wololo again.
The way hardcore gamers began. Excellent and updated.
Old but gold... Still love it
"AOE II was Initially released in 1999 &amp; has been one of my childhood memory ever since.   It certainly has its fair share of flaws: ridiculous pathing, moonwalk, etc....but that's what shapes its uniqueness;  Thanks to the map editor &amp; steam workshop (mods), you would never run out of content. Custom made scenarios like campagins, Tower Defense, hide &amp; seek, to name just a few. What's more, the fact that it is still receiving new DLCs &amp; balance changes (bear in mind this game is 18 years old) surprises me.  All in all, a must have classic IMO"
"A peice of my childhood, restored.  8.5/10 because I don't care how old the game is, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥."
"Wait ... what? 1998 game? on Steam? is this real? = For you Mr. Reader than never played an 'Age of ...' game, i will give you this REALLY FAIR ADVICE:  NEVER EVER JOIN A GAME THAT SAYS ONLY NOOBS, BECAUSE YOU WILL LEAVE WITH A REALLY HARD ANAL ♥♥♥♥  Wait what? im a noob and i can play against 'noobs' because i will get ♥♥♥♥♥? ... so what i do?  Get some friends to play it with you at your way, try practising with AI and try some Micro Managing scenarios (found at workshop). Once you can fluidly play, you should charge against those 'noobs' and destroy them for being Pu$$ies.  Advice : Might as well want to change your name to Pu$$y De$troyer."
"Best RTS game that I've ever played. A lot of fun and gets even better when you have a little creativity and imagination. Online is fun but you'll get your ♥♥♥ kicked by people that have been playing for over a decade. Campaign is basically useless, train with random map.  Graphics are pretty decent, the remaster helped a lot. Keep in mind that a high resolution is recommended for this, the lower the resolution, the smaller the view area. I just supersample my monitor to 1920x1200 and that helps a lot.  10/10"
Nothing's changed from the last time I had it on CD.  Not like that's a bad thing. Can't wait to get the DLC.

"I recommend this game, a classic remade a masterpiece!  And for the new players, this is the time to try this great game."
You get to build your own cities which is cool I guess.
"Built me a village, slaughtered some goats and then i got ♥♥♥♥♥ up the bum by bowmen. 10/10 would play again."
Played this before Starcraft and was 'the' game to have. It's gameplay is true to the original and having the Steam Workshop makes the expierence even better for those who have played this before. Easy for new players to pick up and super addictive for hours of play.
A classic. Play it.
legendary game now in HD
"ahhh age of empires 2 the game of my childhood. this game is awome! i started to play this game since age of kings it has good multiplayer (at least for me) hd graphics, steam work shop mods! dosent it feel good to get A+ on your history test, you learn all about medilval times, william wallace,etc! ive played this game about 5000 hrs and it deserves all the time,ive played this more than all my other steam games i own! when i first played aoe 2 people called me a noob next 10 hrs they still call me a noob next 50 hrs i call people noobs but when i played the game 150 hrs i stoped the noob thing. if i would give a rating for this game i would give a good 10/10 its a must have 100% you must get! it deserves all my time and money! game on :D!"
this game so interesting.
"My childhood  I think it is impossible to meassure how many hours I've spend playing this game.  When I saw it was going to be on steam I was really happy, finally a chanche to play it again.   And although it has been fun, it never is as fun as it used to be.   But still an amazing game."
Great strategy game with for anyone with a nack for micro management. Tons of replayability.
Behold! The Horde of Genghis Khan approaches!
"Decided to play a European diplo map with friends. Played map very well, and planned to double my other friend who was the Persians. Note to self, war elephants are medieval tanks, and on maps (such as Euro diplo) were gold is VERY abundant, many an elephant can come knocking at your door.  10/10 would get rekt in a 2v1 by soley war elephants."
"I really had to think why I would want to buy this game, because I have the older versions lying around somewhere here, and could fetch them within 1 minute. After a bit of thinking I decided to buy the game and it was one of my best choices, being able to load the game without the disc has made me play this game soo much more. This game was my childhood game, I loved all the Age of Empires game series and it was the only thing I played, and it is great to once again play this game and share it with my friends, I have recommend this game to many of my friends because you can't find a better feeling than playing AoE II HD with your friends!"
metacritic 68/100?  Serious??  WOLOLO  metacritic 101/100
"Roses are red, violets are blue... WOLOLOOO, now roses are too."
though not the most complex or pretty RTS game out there it is definltley one of the best. With the medevil warfair and troop it makes you hunt the balence between economy and military.once you home your skills on the campain time to put them to work online where you will get crushed.... then you relize you are ♥♥♥♥ and have to re learn the game. 9/10
this game allowed me to meet some asian noob named rexy...did i mention he was noob
A timeless classic...
i hate bad teammates
"A real classic, used to play it all the time when I was little. Unfortunatly, the 'HD' version hardly changes anything apart from the water graphics.  Pros: 1. Great gameplay. 2. Made in 1999, yet still beats most other modern alternatives.  Cons: 1. Outdated graphics."
"A timeless game, still as exciting as when I played it when I was younger. Style wise, I'm a fan of the isometric look and I think you'll appreciate the aesthetics of this game. I'll be reviewing the elements of the game separately and then give an overall opinion at the end.   Graphics: As stated, it's an isometric game. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the graphics (admittedly, I am slightly biased towards isometric games and some nostalgia may be clouding my opnion) and I think they stand the test of time. With the HD edition, they have improved the fire and water textures. For me, I don't think they impact very heavily on the game. You may notice the difference, however I don't think they add or detract anything to the game. Graphics are the same as the screenshots really, what you see is what you get.  Sound: Not much to say on this aspect. I like the voice acting in the campaigns, the music is cool and fits the setting and game. Sound effects are okay. I think the voices of your units can be pretty annoying once you've heard them so many times but with an RTS I suspect you'll be too busy strategising and dealing with any harassment. There are sound sliders for sound effects and music in game, toggle them to suit yourself.  Gameplay: I love it personally. Before you start, you can select from a variety of maps, set your population limit (maximum amount of units allowed), select your civilisation as well as your colour and enemie's civilisation), and some map settings. I think you'll love the variety in this game as there is a lot of things to fiddle with. Once you have your settings how you like, theres a lot to take into account but in basic, you have four things you need to worry about: food, wood, gold and stone. These resources make up your economy. You have villagers who essentially do everything: build buildings and gather resources. You'll need to make a lot of these in order to build and maintain your economy. It's very important to have a lot of villagers in this game. If there is any water around, you can build a dock and get boats to fish for you. You start with a few villagers to get yourself going.  Building up your economoy is an important aspect of this game and must be monitored for effiency. It can be quite cumbersome of new players, but there are strategies available to you on youtube and wikis to help you out. I like the aspect of micromanaging and ensuring you have what you need to build up your forces, this may not appeal to others however. But from what you can expect from an RTS, I think it's par for the course.  Scouting is important at the start, you can locate your opponents base as well as search for resources. Make sure your scout is always moving but don't neglect your villagers. Make sure they're always doing something (there is an idle villager button which will automatically target idle villagers so you can make sure they are doing something). There is a stats button as well, this is useful to always have on as you can monitor your opponent's economy to gauge how well they are doing.   On the topic of battles, you will most likely be harrassed early on by infantry trying to kill your villagers. I would recommend this tactic as it can stall your opponent's economy for a bit, giving you a small but significant advantage early on. There is a barracks: for close range infanty, an archery range: long range infantry, a stable: for long and short range cavalry and a siege workshop: for vehicles. These will make up the bulk of your forces. There is also naval (for water maps) and when you advance to the castle age, there is a unique infantry for your selected civilisation.   I like the battles in this game. They're always fun and bloody. Usually fast but it depends on what you have. Unfortunatley, there's some issues with lag when you have a lot of players in the game (really bad, like 1 frames per second) but I've only experienced that on very large maps with maybe 6 or 7 AI. Generally, you'll build units in response to whatever the enemy is building. There is a pretty steep curve between difficulties in this game but don't be dettered, I think sticking with this game and delving into more of the deeper, more involved aspects will stand you in good stead and can be really rewarding once you learn some strategies.   General opinion: There's a lot of stuff I've missed out in this review, probably because I could go on forever. There's surely more in depth reviews than mine that you could take a look at. This game is worth your money. It provides countless of hours of fun. It's aged well and you can get absorbed in the battles. The campaigns are really fun too. I recommend this game to anybody who is a fan of RTS or new players who want to get a feel for what it's like.  Just a small edit as of 24/11/2016 - I don't have much time to play games anymore due to work but I really miss playing this."
The Game Is Epic
"Very good game! I like how the stragey is incorporated into the gaming side of things, it is also very fun to play with friends."
The only reason anyone should be paying this kind of money for this game is that they're too damn lazy and are only ever going to play a game these days if it's in their steam library. I know that's why I wasted 20 squid.
Classic game that I used to drop hours in back in the day.   Used to spend hours clearing a entire map of every resource for kicks then wipe out the other teams(Against the computer of course)  Now it's being updated and the online community is stronger than it was before which makes it even more fun and challenging.
"Great remake, the online is a bit buggy but still really nice."
Reminds me of my childhood. Easy to play and hours of entertainment. 10 out of 10
An improved remake of a classic that is better than the original in every way. My only complaint is that the scenario editor was not upgraded more.
Really enjoying this game.
"This game is a cornerstone of my childhood. a definite buy. If you have the funds go for the expansion pack too, very worth it. Great gameplay, a little retro in graphics, but its a game from the 20th century set in the 10th century so its understandable. Really lasts the proverbial test of time."
"The Little Mod That Could. A Franchise Refurbished, Yet a Missed Opportunity.  The age of empires series is one of fame. After 13 years it can still be purchased (along with its expansion, The Conquerors) at Wal-Mart and Office Depot. This 'new' title is an attempt at sprucing up one of the most beloved games of the franchise. It is amazingly rare to see an old property being brought back to life and updated, especially by a parent company that is only looking forward to the next big buck, and are willing to drop any title not making 500% profit (AOE Online was scrapped after a year in the wild, and much needed updates to many games still hang in limbo at EA). Only the bigwigs know what made them bring this one back, but we are glad to see some dust wiped off of our past every once in a while. Developer 'Hidden Path' was contracted to shine up the series fav and bring it into the new age of gaming, they fixed important things and they didn't fiddle around where it wasn't needed, but they missed a couple of points that would have made it into a new age RTS diamond.  First of all, I must thank hidden path for finally raising the unit cap, but why only 500? While it is a good 2.5x higher than before, our machines are 250x more powerful than the Pentium II 200mhz it was originally designed for. I can only guess that much of the core engine remains as it was, and 500 was the highest they could go without breaking it. Even though the cap has been raised, you can still only select 20 units at a time. Was it something that was overlooked? not likely. Here is another notch in the theory of a stretched engine. They just couldn't do more without overhauling the back end.  While we are on the graphics, The reason it has HD in the title is the ability to hit 1920x1080, (and beyond for multi monitor rigs) whereas the original topped out at 1024x768. I agree with the general consensus in that the overhauled building and unit models are amazing, but once again the elderly engine comes through showing us no shadows, no zoom, and no visual effect updates. These are an almost standard feature of today's even bargain bin games that they missed completely. Does it detract from gameplay? Not really. Could they have spent a little more time bringing the graphics engine into this decade without effecting gameplay? yes.  The multiplayer. What can I say here? Game Zone worked (kinda) back in the day, but thankfully we have learned from those early days and have integrated the game wholly into Steam's online network with only a few launch bugs and some early lag issues (to be continued). What this means is a front row ticket to a beautifully seamless multiplayer before-game matching experience, but completely removes the LAN option that, like me, so many young geeks had permanently set up in their basements just for this. Inclusion with the Workshop will make mod and map finding a breeze, and I believe the good outweighs the bad here, but somehow there is still a bad taste somewhere in my mind from losing our offline multiplayer. (single play is still allowed offline).  The music score has been redone, but I can still pound the number keys for WOLOLOOO and 'I Need Wood'. No complaints there.  All-in-all it was well worth the $12 preorder, and it is the authentic Age Of Kings/Conquerors experience, but the lack of improvements to the gameplay, and the surface improvement to the graphics makes this game feel more like a decent mod than a blockbuster.  (For further fiddling- the mod 'Forgotten Empires' does everything this HD remake does, plus adds hours of single player campaigns, and a good dozen fixes)"
"Classic RTS for the win. Old-school RTS that noone has really topped. Even their newer AOE games were imo failures compared to this. Micro manage your economy and your army. Very active multiplayer, only disappointing this is a lot seem to be obssessed with rushing using mostly skirmishers and halberders. No worries though. Why? Because there is a new mode called TREATY mode in the expansion worth getting which essentially keeps out rushers. Rushers no more. It's a CHRISTMAS MIRACLE! Check it out. Buy it if you like RTS, and join me in the Arena or a map of an equivalent similarity ;D"
Classic game! Worth the gold.
Great classics optimized for modern systems; great community. Totally fun.

legendary game now in HD
"ahhh age of empires 2 the game of my childhood. this game is awome! i started to play this game since age of kings it has good multiplayer (at least for me) hd graphics, steam work shop mods! dosent it feel good to get A+ on your history test, you learn all about medilval times, william wallace,etc! ive played this game about 5000 hrs and it deserves all the time,ive played this more than all my other steam games i own! when i first played aoe 2 people called me a noob next 10 hrs they still call me a noob next 50 hrs i call people noobs but when i played the game 150 hrs i stoped the noob thing. if i would give a rating for this game i would give a good 10/10 its a must have 100% you must get! it deserves all my time and money! game on :D!"
"My childhood  I think it is impossible to meassure how many hours I've spend playing this game.  When I saw it was going to be on steam I was really happy, finally a chanche to play it again.   And although it has been fun, it never is as fun as it used to be.   But still an amazing game."
"It's Age of Empires: 2 made accessible, with minor graphical adjustments. The multiplayer games are very simple to setup, and sharing of maps/mods has been made easier through the Steam Workshop that enables you to one-click install a mod. All of these things are great (asides from the new resource icons, but hey there's a mod to revert that!).  When not on sale it does have a pretty hefty price tag, one that you'd expect for a mid-high end modern game. If you're expecting more than Steam integration and resolution changes, then you may feel a bit disappointed to pay full price when it certainly doesn't play as smoothly as you would expect from modern titles. The multiplayer experience is amazingly simple to setup compared to the old ways, but I've heard it can be prone to lagging out - hasn't been a problem for me so far but it's something to keep in mind. Also, the 'HD'-ness is more about zoom and less about more detailed models or animations, which is a shame because it would have been nice to have seen those kinds of updates at least as an option. Also, many of the old glitches with the AI are still quite obviously there, which is something you'd have expected them to fix for a fresh release - there are mods in the Workshop however that can put in custom AIs, but I am yet to try this out myself.  So all in all, if you loved AoE2, you'll love this, as it has all the gameplay that people loved except with multiplayer that is greatly improved in terms of accessibility, which was a major problem with the old game. If you're expecting something revolutionary for AoE2, you won't find it in the base game - the new expansion 'The Forgotten' does add something new/different however, but that's for a different review. For what they've done between the old and new, I don't think it is worth the regular price tag, they could have done a lot more to fix and improve the game experience to make it more worth that amount of money; but I'd say that picking it up in a sale is absolutely worth it - grab some friends and really enjoy the game, for old and new players alike!"
"&lt;3  Hate it or Love it, i love it. Nothing more to say. "
"This is a classic RTS and a must have for any fan of the genre. It is true that many of the mechanics are antiquated by todays standards, but that should not hold any one back from experiancing one of the finest RTS's to have ever graced a computer moniter."
"As a fan of the original game, I immediately fell in love with yet again after a 7 year break. While some may believe that the game is slow when compared to other real-time stratagy games, but, If you believe that, It more than makes up in it's historical elements and diverse gameplay. Plus, the music is fantastic. Few games have such a beautiful and eclectic range of songs."
One of the best strategy game ever (at least for me).
I HIGHLY recommend this game to all my friends. It is one of the BEST RTS games ever made and brings back alot of memories. The game is still extremely well made and looks just as good. I m not even a fan of most RTS games but this one is what hooked me into the genre and what keeps me coming back for more. Now if they could only do this with their star wars battleground series I would be super happy.
"This is without doubt one of the best games that i've played. Loved playing it as a kid so when it was re-released I jumped at the opportunity although suspecting that it wouldnt live up to my memories. However, it fitted the bill perfectly and i have had hours of fun replaying it. Not only is the single player worth paying the meagre price it costs when on sale, but the newly improved mulitplayer adds a fantastic dimension that wasnt there previously. Furthermore the Forgotten expansion pack adds a whole new range of enjoyable campaigns to prolong the game life. A game that you can keep playing over and over again. Well worth it."
This game is my favorite of the AOE games and I love how they added the multiplayer through steam! this is the whole reason that i rebought the game for the multiplayer. It is a much better game than aoe 3
One of the best rts games ive played. Excellent campaign. Recommended to all
"Has more lag issues than its SD counterpart, but is otherwise a welcome addition to the AoE family."
"Age of Empires II is a real time strategy game involving past groups at war; ex. (Spaniards, Mayians, Goths, Romans, Azetecs, Franks, Huns, Chinese, etc.) Gather resources such as Gold, Food, Wood, and Stone with Villagers, in order to produce buildings and army units for which to defend yourself while attacking your opposing armies. There are a couple ways to win; like udderly defeating your opposing armies to which the point they can nolonger build, or building a Wonder (a building that takes the longest to build and just wins in 350 years {Which is like 5 Mins.}). You can play online from 1-8 players, if I remember correctly, with a mix of you, friends and Computer AI. Randomly generated maps make every game a unique experience; Or you can use Map Builder to create your own enjoyment with mazes, islands, extra resources, etc. Now to talk about Campain Mode. Unlike SIngle and Multi-player Modes, Campain Mode is you playing through a specific story of historical relavence, in which the game gives you your group and starting resources to build up and fight the given enemies. With 3 difficulty modes even the tutorial can give the experienced player a run for his money. Win within the given parameters and you can prove yourself to be the Strategy Champion.  I own both Age of Empires II, the Forgotten Expansion, and Age of Empires III (Which I have not played yet) As far as Strategy Games go this is by far the best. I played this years ago and specificly sought this out again when I joined the Steam Family."
"Definitely a good remake of the old AoE 2.  In my opionion, the best AoE ever made. The teams are balanced. The AI is really good, and the graphics are just awesome! #Nergasm"
Great game even though i prefer aoe 3 more
"Age of Empires II HD is a historical real-time strategy game where the player takes on one of a number of civilizations and builds a base using a group of resources (food, wood, stone, and gold) in order to advance technologically and amass an army to attack one (or multiple) enemy bases, who are attempting to do the same to you.  I played the demo endlessly when I was a kid, but never had the opportunity to play the full game. Having come back to it now, mechanically, the game is actually still solid, and individual games can be very pleasant - quick pick-up games are still good. However, when playing strategy games, I prefer to play through the campaign (if one is provided), and this is what I've found difficulty with. A large number of the missions rely overly on already knowing what the map's layout is - knowing where an enemy is based so you can immediately send a surgical strike to take care of someone before they grow too large so you can grow in peace, knowing where fortifications are, etc. So rather, it's a matter of trial an error as opposed to any strategic decisions in order to beat a given level - there's nothing WRONG with this, necessarily, and it was customary at the time, but less so for modern games.  Now, pick-up games where everyone starts from scratch? That's another thing altogether, and the mechanics work fine for that. I just question whether a person who was used to more modern games coming back to this one would find it much of an enjoyable experience without the nostalgia to build off of, as I don't have much myself, and I often found the game to be frustrating.  Ultimately, I'd say the game is worth a look, but for people who didn't play it when it was new, you may run into a similar frustrations."
i love this game...&lt;3
Re-enacted the War of the Five Kings and The War of the Ring.   Would Recommend. 10/10
"Great game! Alot like Aoe3, but with lesser graphics. The thing that kind of ruins this game is the fact that it is, as far as I know, impossible to zoom into the map. Oh well, i'll give it a shot! But still, great gameplay and a worthy addition to my collection."
I have played AoE since AoE I. I think that was the first game I played on computer. AoE 2 is similar but is more interesting and the HD version is really nice.
This game brings back such great memories.   Well worth the money!  
"I could spend hours writing an amazing review about this game, which I'm not gonna do. This game will last forever."
♥♥♥♥ yes buy this game
10/10 Best strategy game ever. I think AOE 2 was the first game i played .
"English:  Ill be honest, im the tipical guy who grow up in the magic world of the mushrom kingdom or whit a little purple dragon and other consoles, i didnt touch a pc game until 2008, and all my friends who played the original one back in earliers 2000, they told me to buy this game, its awsome, etc...  Honestly i like more the fps and adventure games, but then i see on sale this game and i told to miself, why not? The only thing i regret, its for not listen to my friends when they told me to get it when it come out.  Español:  Sere honesto, soy el tipico sujeto que crecio en el magico mundo del mushrom kingdom o en compañia de un pequeño dragon purpura que escupe fuego, no toque mi prime juego de pc hasta el 2008, y todos mis amigos que jugaron al orignal de a principios del año 2000, me decian que comprara este juego, es asombroso y viciante,etc.... Honestamente me gustan mas los juegos del tipo FPS o Aventura, pero entonces vi este juego en ofertas y me dije a mi mismo, por que no? La unica cosa de la que me arrepiento es de no haber escuchado a mis amigos cuando me dijeron que comprara este juego en cuanto saliera a la venta."

"The original game, defined an age. More importantly, it was my most favourite game (next to Command And Conquer 1&amp;2 + Red Alert) of the early 2000's. Alike the original, this game incldes all the features of the old game, map editors, all the campaigns, all the little details. Unlike the original, this game has -MORE-. Steam workshop intergration, add custom music, different textures, maps, and more! Remaking this game, was the most awesome idea, EVER. They -need- to go to EA and ask about a C&amp;C 1 HD edition. :D  Do I reccomend this game? You bet I do!"
"As a teenager this was one of my favourite strategy games of all time. With the help of a few mods, it is brought graphically up to scratch as well :) A nostalgic classic."
"Its fun when your friends are afk and you unally them and destory there houses, then really and when they come back they start crying as this has happened more than once.  10/10 Game  "
"Just hearing the music and seeing the intro video brought a wave of nostalgia so powerful I could almost physically feel it. It took me all of a 5 minuets to remember I was always rubbish at AoE, but I didn't care because I was having so much fun.  Must buy for everyone who played this back in the day, and it still mostly holds up well, so also recomended for those who didn't."
"First game I ever played. Ergo, the nostalgia value is totally worth it.  10/10  Would buy again!"
I beleive this game is amazing over and that all R.T.S. game lovers should play it even if the grpahics arent that good its and old game what do you expect of it
Very nice estrategy game. It's cool to play it in HD
Awesome over-head POV with 4 ages I definetly reccommend this game.
"If you enjoyed playing the original, then you will definitely enjoy this upgraded version. Go buy it now...The upgraded version that is! LALALALALALALA, oh, hi.........................................................Wait a minute! You're still here?! What do you mean a sentence without a conjuction did not adequately convince you to buy this game? Really?!! Despite me giving you a rousing and artful single sentence argument, you're still not persuaded?! Son of a hornswoggler! Very well, if the previous oration did not convince you, read on.  In the new version, microsoft has added several features that make this superior to the original; they have increased the population limit to 500, added an even bigger level size and an even better online multiplayer. The last reason is the main reason why I was willing to buy a game I already owned. I have a friend that I often play AOE with and we both had become exasperated with trying to connect our games together. BUT THEN, like Moses freeing the Hebrews from pharaoh, the new steam version of AOE came and freed us from our plight. Biblical refrences aside, with the steam version of AOE, we can now enjoy playing AOE together whenever or wherever we want without having our blood pressure spike. Oh, and the graphics are nice.   Bottomline: If you played the original and loved it, then you have a 99% chance of being devilishly handsome and also loving this new version. If you want to buy this game whether it is because you have fond memories of running through fields of grass with it, or if you're an everyman philosopher who has just emerged from living in a cave for 24 years and have yet to play it, but the price unnerves your wallet, I would reccomend waiting til the game goes on a sale. Don't misunderstand, the new features in the HD remake are great but are not worth it in themselves, especially if you already own this game. However, if the game is on sale for 10 dollars or less, you know what you need to do.   (Please note that women can be called handsome just as men can, don't believe me? Go read Pride and Prejudice. (3rd paragraph from the end of chapter 45))"
"If you expect to be able to play with your girlfriend and take a break, and restore the game successfully DON'T. This game runs worse then the original so if you own the original don't bother buying this unless your goal is singleplayer. If you don't have a previous copy, torrent it, otherwise well do what you want, Im not your boss."
"Why make an HD version and then lock the resolution to your desktop resolution? Stupid, stupid, stupid. The fire looks terrible and I can't see any other visual differences. This is a downgrade from the original version. Avoid at all cost."

Apart from newer generation of HD remakes this surprised me with unchanged game mechanics and graphics. I like the way they enhanced the textures and let everything else be as it was in original :)
"Tip for multiplayer: Just spam your castle unit. Nothing but that and trebuchets. Everyone else will be doing it, so you should too if you want to stand a chance.  Multiplayer sucks, I wouldn't buy this game for that, but the campaigns are pretty fun, and playing with friends can enjoyable.  Only other thing worth getting this for is the map creator. You can make all sorts of maps with a lot of customization, and even make your own campaigns. If you're the creative type then that would be the thing for you.  "
"Oh yeaaahh, still as good as I remember. Playing online (multiplayer) with my brother and AI is fantastic. Would not recommend to buy this game at full price, but for 5 €/$ its a good deal for endless hours of fun.   The bad: I experience some lag when playing online. This issue can be read on many places including Steam forum. So...thats a shame. But its still playable. I hope they are going to fix it soon.  Edit: typo"

Played this before Starcraft and was 'the' game to have. It's gameplay is true to the original and having the Steam Workshop makes the expierence even better for those who have played this before. Easy for new players to pick up and super addictive for hours of play.

"Age of Empires II has been one of the greatest RTS games I have ever played, and to bring it back as a HD edition with many extra features makes it a must have in any gamer's collection."
"I played this game when I was growing up for countless amounts of hours, and coming back to it, I definitely see why I did. A surprisingly deep RTS with plenty of variety built directly into it. Playing as all of the different civilizations is what truly makes the game last as each race has very interesting unique units that keep the gameplay fresh in every match. As you change civilizations, you are also wise to change your strategy of gameplay as each civilization also has unique bonuses and disadvantages in several areas.   As for the visual updates, the game looks more or less the same that it did so long ago, but of course now with higher resolution. I highly recommend checking out some of the graphical mods that users have put into the steam store in order to obtain a true graphical update.  Gameplay - 8/10 Sound - 7/10 Graphics - 6/10 (mostly outdated, but that's to be understood) Lasting Appeal - 8/10 Overall - 7.5/10"

In the new version, microsoft has added several features that make this superior to the original; they have increased the population limit to 500, added an even bigger level size and an even better online multiplayer. The last reason is the main reason why I was willing to buy a game I already owned. I have a friend that I often play AOE with and we both had become exasperated with trying to connect our games together. BUT THEN, like Moses freeing the Hebrews from pharaoh, the new steam version of AOE came and freed us from our plight. Biblical refrences aside, with the steam version of AOE, we can now enjoy playing AOE together whenever or wherever we want without having our blood pressure spike. Oh, and the graphics are nice.   Bottomline: If you played the original and loved it, then you have a 99% chance of being devilishly handsome and also loving this new version. If you want to buy this game whether it is because you have fond memories of running through fields of grass with it, or if you're an everyman philosopher who has just emerged from living in a cave for 24 years and have yet to play it, but the price unnerves your wallet, I would reccomend waiting til the game goes on a sale. Don't misunderstand, the new features in the HD remake are great but are not worth it in themselves, especially if you already own this game. However, if the game is on sale for 10 dollars or less, you know what you need to do.   (Please note that women can be called handsome just as men can, don't believe me? Go read Pride and Prejudice. (3rd paragraph from the end of chapter 45))"
"Age of Empires II HD is a historical real-time strategy game where the player takes on one of a number of civilizations and builds a base using a group of resources (food, wood, stone, and gold) in order to advance technologically and amass an army to attack one (or multiple) enemy bases, who are attempting to do the same to you.  I played the demo endlessly when I was a kid, but never had the opportunity to play the full game. Having come back to it now, mechanically, the game is actually still solid, and individual games can be very pleasant - quick pick-up games are still good. However, when playing strategy games, I prefer to play through the campaign (if one is provided), and this is what I've found difficulty with. A large number of the missions rely overly on already knowing what the map's layout is - knowing where an enemy is based so you can immediately send a surgical strike to take care of someone before they grow too large so you can grow in peace, knowing where fortifications are, etc. So rather, it's a matter of trial an error as opposed to any strategic decisions in order to beat a given level - there's nothing WRONG with this, necessarily, and it was customary at the time, but less so for modern games.  Now, pick-up games where everyone starts from scratch? That's another thing altogether, and the mechanics work fine for that. I just question whether a person who was used to more modern games coming back to this one would find it much of an enjoyable experience without the nostalgia to build off of, as I don't have much myself, and I often found the game to be frustrating.  Ultimately, I'd say the game is worth a look, but for people who didn't play it when it was new, you may run into a similar frustrations."

"Love this game my friend multiplayered me right when i got it he annihilated me so i go to single player doing fine and I was aout to win but they made a wonder,honestly the game is freaking fun its addicting at times and times fly by while u play it."
"If you feel surrounded by savages, plagued with a constant aspiration to rule the world; and, can't get enough of that horse whinny.  Congratulations! Agies 2 is now your life. Or you could get a job or something."

"In the year 2002, my cousin introduced me to Age of Empires II, a week after he let me play my first game, he handed it over to me and i played nonstop as a child. It's taken me a year to properly get aclimated with the HD Edition. So here's my thoughts.  Age of Empires II is to least to say, not out-dated. The gameplay and mechanics are just as fresh as they were when the game first came out. It has a huge online following that keeps it updated with new maps and mods to play, The online aspect has been smoothed out to make it easier with the inclusing of a matchmaking service, something that previously was messy due to a lack of offical online support after MSN Game Zone closed down. Hidden Path did a wonderful job here of taking such a old game and bringing it into the new generation.  But this isnt a game for everyone. You wont expect everyone to pick this up and enjoy it. Most games last over 30 minutes, some going into the 2 hour range. Devoting time to learning every civilization is key to knowing how to win every game you play. There is a single player that acts as sort of a tutorial that helps you get better over time. It's the same learning curve as in the past, outside of A.I games, there is no difficulty setting. Sometimes the A.I will dance around you, while sometimes 5 minutes into a match they will be at your gate with battering rams. It's a mixed bag, the bots could use a lot more work to make them act more human instead of rushing bases.   Pros The ease of steam for multiplayer games, the matchmaking is spot on and can throw you into games without having to set up anything Steam Workshop intergration of maps, mods is excelent. Widescreen Support, High Resolution Support  Cons Framerate is extremely iffy to this day, at launch it was an unplayable mess, but now its at a stable rate. Outside of the population increase, no new additions to the game (minus The Forgotten, the 5 new campaigns are a welcome sight) The Higher resolutions can create some issues with reading some of the text on screen, makes units also seem small compared to the world.  Pick this game up. You wont regret it or get bored with it. Play though the single player, play random map games, play online, get friends together and get a game going on a friday night"
Crashes alot.
"If you expect to be able to play with your girlfriend and take a break, and restore the game successfully DON'T. This game runs worse then the original so if you own the original don't bother buying this unless your goal is singleplayer. If you don't have a previous copy, torrent it, otherwise well do what you want, Im not your boss."
"It has game breaking bugs, but it's still worth it. Wait, now you won't think it's worth it anymore. Oops."
Got an A+ on my history exam.  10/10
"Why make an HD version and then lock the resolution to your desktop resolution? Stupid, stupid, stupid. The fire looks terrible and I can't see any other visual differences. This is a downgrade from the original version. Avoid at all cost."
It's such an amazing game to play with friends :D.
A very balanced and unique game. Good for developing strategies and ones mind.
"Very fanny game. Yf you don't have sk1ll, don't pl4y it Magyars &gt; aztecs"
"Oh yeaaahh, still as good as I remember. Playing online (multiplayer) with my brother and AI is fantastic. Would not recommend to buy this game at full price, but for 5 €/$ its a good deal for endless hours of fun.   The bad: I experience some lag when playing online. This issue can be read on many places including Steam forum. So...thats a shame. But its still playable. I hope they are going to fix it soon.  Edit: typo"
Lost my base to my own army after some random guy said 'Wololo'.   10/10
"Good game. But however whenever I have a bunch of friends over to all play (usually 4 people) the game comes down with the case of....LAG..... We all have really good computers and 60 megs of internet so I have no idea why the game lags so hard, even with the population set to 200. Hopefully an update will fix this."

"Great game. It reminds me of the original Starcraft, but slightly more complex. Very good game. I played it before it came to steam and thats why my hours are so low. For rts fans and newcomers!"
"Age of Empires II has been one of the greatest RTS games I have ever played, and to bring it back as a HD edition with many extra features makes it a must have in any gamer's collection."
"I played this game when I was growing up for countless amounts of hours, and coming back to it, I definitely see why I did. A surprisingly deep RTS with plenty of variety built directly into it. Playing as all of the different civilizations is what truly makes the game last as each race has very interesting unique units that keep the gameplay fresh in every match. As you change civilizations, you are also wise to change your strategy of gameplay as each civilization also has unique bonuses and disadvantages in several areas.   As for the visual updates, the game looks more or less the same that it did so long ago, but of course now with higher resolution. I highly recommend checking out some of the graphical mods that users have put into the steam store in order to obtain a true graphical update.  Gameplay - 8/10 Sound - 7/10 Graphics - 6/10 (mostly outdated, but that's to be understood) Lasting Appeal - 8/10 Overall - 7.5/10"

What can i say epic game
Apart from newer generation of HD remakes this surprised me with unchanged game mechanics and graphics. I like the way they enhanced the textures and let everything else be as it was in original :)
Game of my childhood.  11/10
Great game
Turn down for wololo.
If you loved the first one you will love the remake even more
so good the best nice and good
Best Medievel Game Out there! Pretty much the orignal clash of clans!
"Awesome Sequel to the first Age of Empires, great game set in the middle ages"
"So half the players just build there little towns and age up through time, but dont build military. It's like there playing sim city or something. But that's fine. Nothing more entertaining than burning down there citys and killing all there people with a few knights and a catapult."
Love it
"Well, I spent my money for something that doesn't work properly. It randomly drops everytime when I right click in standard game. Also some missions doesn't work at all. This game is not stable. I hope that this will be fixed soon. Until that time, I can't recommend to play it."
Possibly the best game i have ever played.
"Played it since young, still one of the best strategy game so far on PC."
I remember playing this when I was younger. It was the best game what I knew and it is still one of the best games I have ever played.  Still tenouttaten and sausage/package

A timeless classic. Best played with friends over the internet or in LAN.  Spam the WOLOLO soundbit whenever you can. It's the ONLY way you can be good at this game.
"I remember that AoE was great. Variety of units, strict to historical times, just brilliant strategy game. But when I purchased HD edition and played for a while I felt something is different. AI is terribly bad. Units dont know how to maneuver properly, getting stuck on each other. Good think I purchased it on huge discount, otherwise it would be a terrible waste of money."

beautiful game. it makes me remember the old times :)   I was very little to understand the campaign story. But now I am trying to finish all campaigns.   This is what I want from a game. Relaxing and great experience. And yeah great map design.
Honestly. This game is amazing. Without a doubt the best RTS of all time and it just keeps getting better.
Old Classic remastered!!! love it
Best Strategy Of All Time
"Great game, this brings back childhood memories   Wreaking havoc with cars :)"

"I have literally played this game probably a thousand times. First as a teenager, starting off with the download-version, then buying the hard copy. Now I've bought it on Steam and I still discover new things! (and of course, ACHIEVEMENTS!)  Did you know that you don't always start off with sheep? That sometimes you get turkeys? Yes? Me too. BUT!! Did you know that sometimes, you don't get sheep, you don't get turkeys, sometimes....... you get llamas. And, even more rarely, you get cows! Brand new information, thought I'd share it with the world :-)"
"Much 1999, many nostalgia, wow. 10/10 would spend 500 hours on again."
Bringing back the wololo's of our childhood.
"I'm usually more of a console gamer then a pc gamer, but there are some exceptions to that. I've owned the original CD versions of various Age of Empires games, but I have also had a soft spot for Age of Empires 2 and it's expansion.   The Campaigns are very well thought out, providing us with a immersive storyline that can at times get challenging and you feel the heat. Same with the scenarios as well.   The Skirmishes are pretty good as well, usually use these for testing out a mix of unit combinations to see what works well together, and working out the maps, best places to build or hold etc.  I've not explored Multiplayer that much, but if it's as good as the campaign or other features, I'm guaranteed to have fun.   All in all, I've had great fun playing this game. If your into RTS games, then I would strongly recommend this as its got a lot of playability."
This game sucks  Now that I have your attetion this game is awesome
" Title : Age of Empires II HD   Genre : Strategy  Developer : Hidden Path Entertainment, Ensemble Studios   Publisher :Microsoft Studios   Release Date 10 Apr, 2013    Gameplay"
"I think Microsoft, not knowing what to do with the series after giving the kick in the ♥♥♥ to Ensemble, he has resorted to a good idea but has not been able to do it. The Forgotten was a new dream for lovers of this game between myself included. But, it seems incredible that turns out better Forgotten Empires than The Forgotten Age II HD. I think it is time to pay real attention to the series, but have to resort to Goodman. In any case I recommend the game. Why? Because it is simply the best classic real-time strategy adapted to our use of the games today. Times have changed, the game also . Notable improvements between the HD and the original version and many more in The Forgotten . I think there will be more after The Forgotten. At least, we have enjoyed an official expansion for this game after more than 10 years. Of course there are bugs, and things occasionally embitter our late, but I like knowing that there is a lot of people behind the curtain working on their own in this game and it is thanks to them that Microsoft did 'something' about. Thanks to the guys of AISCripters with her UserPatch, to Cysion and all the people who gave their work to form a new expansion adding 5 more civilizations and a new campaign and keep waiting for the audio in Spanish. Please forgive my english."
This game is great!!
"It is really the exact same as the older version, I think it would be a little extreme to call it 'HD'. That being said, it is nice to have a Steam version of the game to play with your friends. Buy it cause you like the game and want to play it with friends, not because you want it to look better, or you'll be disappointed."
"The rethought version of the best RTS game, Age of Empires II. Better graphics, better support for modern hardware, Steam based multiplayer. The 'The Forgotten' DLC is great, adds 5 more civs, new maps and game modes. I think the game's more complete if you have the DLC, too. For this HD remake of that old gold classic, I give: 8/10!"
wololo ! Buy This Game ! wololo !
"Excellent remake of the classic Age of Empire 2. Runs well, come with the Conqueror's Expansion for free, and can be augmented with additional content. The campaigns are fun as is single player and multiplayer. Fairly active multiplayer community. A bunch of achievements to keep you coming back. Overall and excellent game, I highly recommend it for any Real Time Strategy fans.  Just a little update played this at 348.8 hours as of 11/25/2016 without the DLC Expansions. Bought them today on Black Friday and from what I understand they're on sale very good price. So far enjoying the campaign and the whole new level of re-play value to AoE2 and worth a look if you want to pick up some cheap games for the Steam Sale."
Sigh... Still the best RTS game ever made.
"Personally i've always loved rts games, but in my opinion, the 90% got an average quality. Except some titles. and aoe2 is amog those. It's a masterpiece. music it's stunning, grapihcally it's still good and it is really funny. Steam user buy this game!"
do you like how easy and enjoyable to play modern rts games are? then don't buy this.

old but so gold!
Not so HD.. Still the best RTS game I've ever played!
Only 90s kids will remember this.
Great game
I like that there are some new civs. And the giant maps and increased pop limits almost make it a different game. I like being able to build 21 castles at a time.
"It is extremely boring in Singleplayer, but give this game to a few friends and play with them, and you will spend all ♥♥♥♥ing night playing it. 8/10"
"One of the most classic games in the history of strategy game, was revived on Steam, bringing the easy way to be connected with your friends and make epic battles together. This remastered version have new HD textures and audios. Also after 10 years, they release a new full expansion (DLC) The Forgotten with 5 new civilizations and 4 new campaings. Definetely the reborn of a classic."
"I definitely recommend this game. At $20, its sort of a bad deal. I should've just stayed at its cyber Monday price of 7.99 This game has few additional features, from enhanced population, actual multiplayer (In comparison to the disk which is pretty much just a single player game now), and if you're willing to pay ANOTHER 10 DOLLARS FOR DLC!!!! A few more units, and civilizations. Steam just needs to drop the price. The HD graphics aren’t worth 20 dollars. But other than that. This game brings back so much Nostalgia, 10 years without playing this game that has practically made my childhood, was honestly kind of worth the $20."
The greatest RTS of all time! It never gets old!
The Mongols invaded Ireland and the Aztecs came to their rescue.  10/10
old but so gold!
"My first review of this game was just a joke review, but after several patches, hotfixes and another expansion, I think it's time to write a proper one (this review therefore extends over the base game and both expansions).  For starters, something positive: The new Civs added are really well balanced and fun to play! Here definitely lies the strength of the dev team. They insert themselves into the game seamlessly and feel like they were always part of the game. This adds a ton of replayability, because there are a lot of new strategies to explore, both in terms of playing and defeating them.  One of the main features advertised with the HD Edition was the 'new and improved AI'. Well... this is definitely not the strength of the dev team, in my opinion. The AI definitely is better than the one from the original game and definitely can be challenging, but it's still lacking in a lot of areas. Basically the biggest 'improvement' is that it rushes. Really hard and in big numbers. This makes it really frustrating for beginners to get into the game. But when you can fend of the hordes of enemies and the big first attack, it becomes as easy as usual.  Worth a (negative) mention is the multiplayer. It's unstable as ♥♥♥♥ and it doesn't seem to get better. You get unbearable lag and disconnects and when you think the game is running stable for once, you get an Out of Sync.  This, together with the amount of bugs the game has, some of them still from the release years ago, is pretty sad to be honest. I'm sure the dev team is doing their best to fix this... but that's just not enough at this point. I literally never had a multiplayer session without issues with this game.  All in all, I still recommend this game though.  It's still a lot of fun to play and the campaigns are great too. You can still put hundreds of hours into this game without even having to touch multiplayer once and if you don't like the new AI you can still play with the old Conquerors one. Get the game when it's on sale though, because paying full price is only worth it when multiplayer finally works better than it does right now."
"my mum said i could only play this game if i ate my dog poop, so i did  10/10 would eat cat poo covered dog ♥♥♥♥ again"
"The second newest release in the 'Age of' series by Microsoft is pretty good, but feels very derivative. As a matter of fact the game feels almost identicle to a much earlier realese, Age of Empires II. The striking simularity in the units, nations and gameplay is undeniable. It almost feels like they've gone backwards since the previous release 'Age of Empires III'. Fortunately the most recent release 'Age of Mythology Extended Edition' is a step forward."
"A blast from the past for modern machines. This is probably one of the best RTS's ever made, the singleplayer campaign is probably the best entertaining method of a history lesson, and the depth of RTS elements is still solid to this day. AOEII HD gives you the ability to run at extremely high resolutions, and the steam workshop community has brought a collection of HD Texture packs, custom missions, custom units and buildings, etc. The expansion, which I have not purchased yet, was a AOE II mod years in the making that was adopted by Microsoft Studios to be a full blown expansion for AOE II HD, which ads entirely new civilizations, etc. Also, Steamworks support has made playing online with friends in this classic extremely easy.   If you hunger for a piece of history from the golden-era of gaming, this is definitely something to pick up and play."
The good old Age of Empires in a new repolished version. A must buy when on sale.
Standard old AoEII is better...
Great game!
Why dont you own this game?
"First let me say I am a casual RTS player. I tend to play the campaign for fun, and rarely if ever dip into any competitive play. I played this many years ago and enjoyed it, and I really wanted to like this newer version. Unfortunately, the AI has been so tuned up that any sort of casual relaxing play through of the campaign appears to be impossible. You have to play hard, way to hard IMO, just to play the campaigns. So thumbs down until they give us a way to use the original AI in the campaigns."
"As of patch 4.4, in-game controls no longer work when the game is paused, and loading times are now pathetically slow. Challenging strategy has been traded for real time masochism. Patch 4.4 has effectively rendered harder campaigns unplayable, and a previously enjoyable game has become agonizing. 0/10 "

Well yeah.... This is a great game
Wololo You must now buy this game.
This be good game
"No ultra-wide support. No 4K support (UI/scaling). No Linux support. Apparently doesn't work on Windows 10. DRM, so no LAN with one copy of the game. Textures are mostly unchanged, 'HD' means 1080p and nothing more.  If you have the original game on disc, it is not worth rebuying. Feels more like a simple patch than a remaster."
"Don't buy, just lag and bugs. Do not spoil your memory of this game"

"The Game That Defined an Age! Truer words were never spoken! This game truly was the first in a long line of progressively better games! Yes, just like the steam engine, black and white television, houses made from a fine mix of animal dung and straw, and the flint-tipped pointy stick, this game really did make designers sit up and think, 'Oh dear...

You know you are getting old when one of your favourite game has an HD version of it...
On of the best RTS games ever released. I would also like to add that this is better than Age Of Empires III. A must buy for fans of this genre.  I spent countless number of hours playing this game before the Steam version came out. Fond memories.
"Multiplayer bugs aside (I always preferred to play games like these single player anyway), this is a superb return to one of my old favorite rts games. I'd forgotten how simple but challenging (does that make sense) AoE and other similar rts game such a the Cossacks series were.  I've spent virtually all day playing this game; something I've not done in ages (apart from maybe the newly released Pinball FX2). Starting from humble beginnings to building an empire you get an abundance of choice from one of the 18 playable nations each with their own unique bonuses, units and tech tree's, so each game is going to play differently. I can see hundreds of hours of game play in this beautifully crafted game.   I throughly recommend this updated version of Age of Empires. I'm sure it'll be in the summer sale. ;)  "
HD is a lie. Interface sux.
"It's Age of Empires II but prettier and with Steam (workshop, invitations etc.). If you have the original game, don't buy this, it's not worth it."
"After patch 4.4 upgrade the game became unplayable. No sound, game freezes, you are kicked off middle game.  Many functions not working, its terribly buggy.  Dont buy it, i am asking for refund."
patch 4.3 sux ... find next idle worker DOES NOT work anymore ... even if I change the hotkey!
:)
My friend made a huge army and decided to attack gray when he got there he was greeted by a massive army of monks (intense wololo takes place) monks convert his entire army and turns it on him they destroy him and he is forced to resign   10/10 wololo can take over the world
"Not in HD , still the same , execpt minor looks for some stuff ."
30/30 would 30 again.  WOLOLO!
BUGGED. AS. HELL.   Simply put: the game is barely PLAYABLE. There's bugs since the start screen to mid-game cutscenes. Even the time counter on steam is bugged.  This is the first game ever I am asking for a refund.
"The HD version of Age of Empires II is just terrible, and unplayable to many people."
"If I wanted to write a review about this game, I wouldn't. But since I need to I'm going to, just to spare the future buyers of this game the shame of being left buttplugged. This game is a straight up sh*t fountain. Imagine taking a good game from the past, plugging the sh*tty graphics with a cork, then letting it sit stale. This is what this game is. It`s such stale sh*t that it`s very crap. Much disappoint. Wow. When under heavy battles, it lags, and has compatibility issues. Here is your elaborate review, you can thank me later. Get the normal edition and mod it."
"Age of Empires 2 was (is) one of the best games ever.  However I don't recommend to buy the HD version, since the devs ♥♥♥♥ed it up hard. Every second round someone crashes or the full games gets out synch. Additional many others bugs.  The worst is that those things got added by the new devs, but when they got asked about fixing it, they don't even bother to answer."
"AGE OF EMPIRES II HD: FRAUD VERSION.  This version of the game doesn't have anything better than the no-HD version.  Unlike the original version, you can´t play LAN games (remember that on LAN the speed is much higher). The amazing new LudiKRIS map size seems to make your game go 'Out of Sync' (and therefore ends) when you play with friends &amp; AI, at least with The Forgotten expansion. Increasing standard population limit overloads any average pcs and online games go slower. There are no major graphics improvements and you would expect at least a few tweaks to make the game more playable.  On the good side, there are some people to play on Internet ( but not a lot) and the new music is good.   About The forgotten expansion, the new civilizations are interesting and they seems to be balanced.   The worst is the price. Steam try to steal us money with a non optimized game which at times feels even worse than the 14 years old version. In my opinion, Steam have done the minimun effort to relunch the game putting a ludicrous price, taking advantage of nostalgia."
"The game itself wasn't actually HD. If you're expecting the graphics to be improved drastically (But still, there are slightly improvements. But I'd still say StarCraft 1 has a better graphic compare to this HD version of AoE II.) compare to its previous version, you're gonna have a bad time. I'm consider to be lucky enough for not buying the game at a higher price. About the gameplay itself, of course, it is still as great as the non-HD old one. Further explanation of the gameplay not needed."
"Amazing game but ruined by the awful lag issues in multilpayer to the point that it's unbearable to play.  don't buy this POS, it's nothing like the original"
"Do not get this game as you'll get VERY disappointed. The multiplayer system in here is VERY awful and it has disappointed many players. The video you see does not REPRESENT the real game experience, and like many, including myself, we have the feeling of being played tricks on by Microsoft. Although, it may not be much, 4.74€, you should either save them or spend them on a game, where they show the REAL game itself and not just a fake video."
"The p2p multiplayer is a laggy peice of ♥♥♥♥, do not buy it if you intend on playing with friends, it's unplayable especially with larger numbers of players."
"The game runs realy realy slow in MP. At one point it stopped completely. Please fix this and provide a patch for it. We're not paying for this game to have it running like this... For shame Microsoft, for shame!"
"The Age of Empires II HD remake will certainly be appealing to people who have never played this before, but should remain a luxury copycat to die-hard AoE fans. While it will hopefully fix some of the issues with the original version at some point - such as the infamous broadband lag in multiplayer - there is only one resolution to choose from (native), the only other option being a rather impractical window mode. The game also takes up a vast amount of GPU resources with nothing more than minor differences in visual quality for units. The pixelated FMV introduction certainly emphasizes this part.  Added features: - Population cap of 500 (instead of 200) for even larger battles (?) - ELO rating system with a good bunch of flaws - Audio dubs for campaigns  At the time of writing, the following features have been removed from the game: - Default 'Fast' speed, changing speed prior to starting up a game (solo or multiplayer) and changing speed in the tutorial campaign  Make sure you have a decent computer and graphics card before buying this game. The recommended specs will likely not be enough."
"AOE II is a classic, but this 'HD' version is not worth the money.  Only cliffs and terrain are HD, if you want better units and buildings you'll need to download them, but not throught the workshop, as units and buildings are not supported.  The expansion pack (The forgotten) is a mod, and unofficial expansion pack made by fans and monetized, if you own the original AOE II like me, go download it, it's free."
"the original age of empires II was a great game. one of the best rts games of all time. this 'HD' version is just crap and a waste of money.. nothing has been improved, at a higher resolution the game just looks squashed, the new campaigns are poorly made, and do little to resemble the original campaigns which were so strong. there is no balance anymore and the new civilisations are just crap... would love to get my money and the time i wasted playing this back!"
"The game is as great as it was 17 years ago. This HD edition simply allows you to play it easily on a modern operating system, with very minor graphic improvements.   Multiplayer is what convinced me to buy it, but it clearly needs further work. When a game stops for unknown reasons (which happens often), you have the possibility to 'load' your save, but so far, after a few months playing the game, it has never worked. You find comments on forums reporting this bug as early as two years ago, yet nothing has been done to fix the issue.  Great game but not worh the price until the developers fix the multiplayer, which is still not stable."
This game plays fine on single player but the servers are horrible for multiplayer. There is constant lag and choppiness. I even wrote to the developers and all they said is it should be fixed. They are just trying to make a profit. They completely ruined my experience of this game.
I am the shepherd of games and I alone will dictate whether a game is trash or not. This game is not trash.
Quite primitive by today's standards. Don't know how I remembered it so fondly.
"I had fun with this game until the new patch came out, now the game is so fast and aggressive that I have to use cheats to play, which takes all the fun out of it for me. I like to play very casual and slow, but now that's gone with the patch. Is there a way to remove the patch? I doubt it and now I won't play this game the way it is set up now. If you like to play single player and play casual this game is not for you."
"One of my favorite games ever which has a catastrophic bug that I've seen on two Steam Support threads that makes it impossible to start no matter what you try. Given the developers' indifference to providing a fix to the bug, I have to say that no one should buy this game for any reason unless they are fans of Russian Roulette or mid 2006's XBox 360's."
You dont know this game????? poor you
"It was great when i was little, it is great now! best money can buy. Especially when you are playing multi with your mates in team chat, just can't get enough!"
START THE GAME ALREADY.
"Well AOE II is just an instruction for everyone, how to make awesome strategy game. I've been playing for 15 years now, and the game always keep me discovering some new things and make me feel comfortable with what am i doing. You know, these days strategy games are not what they had been before. So for summary, I recommend this game to everyone, it realy helps you a lot in your life, by increasing your tactical and logical thinking, and it's easy to play even for 4 years old kids.  Hope you'll like my recommendation and sorry for english mistakes, if there are any."
"This is a great game, bringing back memories of the classic game. Personally, I do not find the graphics alone worth the full price, but everything else about the game is very much the same. Multiplayer matches are easier to find and more consistant with the Steam version auto-update enabled. The Forgotten DLC adds to content not present in the original without breaking the concept of the game. Certainly worth it if you enjoyed the original!  *If you are an achievement hunter, be prepared to do a LOT of grinding."
"Awfully made game, bugs, crashes and laggy to the extreme online.  Would I recommend? - definitely, this game will never age, gamplay so good you can look right past all the problems and still give it 9/10"
I really really really really really really like it.
"this game make me single. I have been play this game for 30 years and no doubt, im still addict to this game. Oh godd.., i think this game paralyzed my life. Help Me!!!!"
"I'm not a really big fan of RTS games. My brain simply can't keep up with managing resources, constructing buildings, and fighting battles...all at the same time! However, I remember playing AoE2 a bunch when I was a kid, so I picked it up for $4 during a sale, not expecting much from it.  I'm glad to say that this was a good purchase!  For a game that was released in 1999, the game holds up well on every front - even the graphics! The game has been marketed as an 'HD' release, but aside from the water, everything still looks pretty much the same way it did 15 years ago, which is not a bad thing at all.   Even though I'm not a fan of RTS games, there's something that feels different about AoE2. Typically in an RTS game, I'll be minding my own business and building up my base when suddenly a horde of enemy units will swarm over my base and destroy everything, leaving me wondering how the AI churned out so many units that fast. I don't get this feeling while playing AoE2. Instead, I feel like I have the time to appreciate the different ages and technologies, while still being competitive and in the game.  If you're like me and enjoyed this game way back in the 20th Century, I would recommend purchasing this game again (especially since it's so cheap). Even if you've had no experience with Age of Empires before, I would still recommend it, as it has aged well, and the gameplay is still solid."
DON'T BUY IT THIS GAME IT IS TERRIBLE!!!  Monk: Wololo!  BUY IT THIS GAME IS FABULOUS!!!
This game is so gr8 :DDDD
"played lots a child, can play it lots now again. must have :)"
Pretty good
Amazing how a 15-16 year old game manage to keep people playing. Great fun with friends.
Good old times :(
I grew up with this game and I still think that it is one of the best RTSs out there even after all the years that have passed. 10/10 Ram of War Elephants
"Yes, this game was my childhood growing up. I would recommend this game to all my fellow videogame enthusiests to try at least once. :)"
Im not a big fan of RTS but I like this game however each game will take a couple hours or more to complete.  Theres a cheat code to drive a Shelby Cobra in the Medieval times 10/12
"My childhood was based around the original unfortunately this does little than improve the HD water, bump up the pop cap, add a few achievements and a debatable better multiplayer experience. However its still a goddam awesome game so if you dont own it and you love strategy games buy it otherwise your money is better spent elsewhere or playing the original on tuungle/voobly."
"Just wish i didnt have to readjust resolution on 4k monitor so much,...."
This game is awesome. I've had it for 10 years and still play it.
Still a great game even afterr 15 years 10/10
Such a classic game that will never get old enough
"This is awesome to play again on this great game, but I'm not sure it's worth to pay this price for something without real new adds"
Still one of the best RTS's of all time and great for online games with friends.
Every now and again a game comes along that will stand the test of time. Age of Empires II is that game. I cant express how awesome this game was and is. Takes me back to my early Gaming days as a kid and now i find myself addicted to it once again spending 3hours at a time in epic online battles and then playing another.. and another.... A must buy for any lover of startegy games! 10/10
Do you remember Age of Empires II? Do you want a fun RTS that feels looser and bigger than the Blizzard flagbearers of the genre but isn't quite as involved in skill trees and stat-tracking as other heavyweights of its day? Check this out.
"Great, even better than I remember it, great times with family and friends had on here"
really nice game
"This game is just like the original, and Microsoft's definition of 'HD' is apparently 'runs on Windows 7;' but that's OK because the original was an amazing game. If you played the original, then think the game a decade ago, but with Steam Achievements and better Multiplayer support.  If you didn't play the decade ago, then think of Starcraft, but set in medieval times and without the same level of questionably legitimate tactics."
"Hasn't really changed since 1999, but that's not really a problem."
♥♥♥♥ you you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥
"Played online with a friend vsing AI's....we lost, if you want a challenge but fun at the same time get it. 10/10 would fail again."
"In my opinion, it is the best of the three AoE games."
"I'd already posted a review some 2 years ago, but eventually deleted it because it was overly shallow.  After over 11 years playing AoE II, I can still say it's my favourite RTS ever. It's that kind of game you get really fond of, each year more, through your childhood and adolescence, Unfortunately, I must admit I'm absolutely unable to be fair in rating this game, because I have no idea what impression an Age of Empires neophyte would get in 2015 from a 16-years old game.   What I can say, is that it's quite pricey. After 2 years from the HD release, it's still sold for no less than 20 euros, and steam transaction history reminds me I bought it on April 11 (2013) for €18.99. As I doubt there is any RTS enthusiast who has never come across this game in the last decade and a half, and considering nobody but RTS aficionados would look up such a retro game, I suggest everyone reading to pass on until it's on sale.  Pertaining to the improvements allegedly made from the original game, I can't say they've done a great job. They merely noticed there was a massive on-line community after all those years and told themselves 'oy vey we could make some good shekels with this geriatric'. The 500 unit cap is great, but you don't exactly need to be a sagacious or creative developer to figure it out. 'HD'? Doesn't feel so. The textures were barely touched, although even if they'd been, I wouldn't have cared.  The Forgotten Expansion is objectively good. I have tested the Italians, the Slavs and the Magyars only, but except for the last one the other 2 really feel like unique factions. I generally don't play non-european civ's so I'm just going to say the Incas are a great pain in the ♥♥♥♥. Playing against the Indians feels like assaulting pakistani mini-markets with trebuchets and knights. However, considering the expansion adds a bunch of new civ-related campaigns too, 9 euros aren't that bad."
"When you think about games that came down to you when you were a child, maybe an medieval RTS doesn't forcefully pop first than things like Mario, Zelda or Pokemon. That was... not my case.   When I was 6 years old my mom bought Conquerors and teached me a very darn basic concept of the game. I got hanged, heavily. I didn't understand why but I loved the campaigns, I was obscenely bad at the game. But I liked it  a  lot  . And then as I grew I got a better understanding, but my love somewhat diminished because I was ignorant of the AOE2 community being alive as hell. Being clueless about the such AoC passed to be a good memory. Then one day of 2014 one video pops in my YouTube feed about AoE2. I watch and remember some dumb things like the wololo rush. And there it is. A recommendation about AOE2HD.     wait  65watts . But not only that, because I knew about this game until way later there was also a  new expansion  called  The Forgotten . It were the 10 most epic seconds of my life (watching the intro). And then I just had to get it. I love it even more than ever, the community is vibrant, I keep coming with new ways to play it with friends and new AIs, graphic mods left and right. But the best part about it is that AOE2 is probably the game that I've seen live the most and the fact it's going strong really gets me going.   And the ' worse ' part comes: It will have another mother effing expansion. You just won't see a bit of that effort in things like Diablo 2. God ♥♥♥♥ing damn it.  I love this game. "
Great improvement onto the original while keeping the nostalgia alive. 9/10 (Can be a little bad on FPS in battles)
So many age. So much empire.  Plenty HD. Wow.
A boar takes 25 arrow hits. 10/10
"I love this game! I'll keep this plain, simple, and quick! This game made me fall in love with the RTS genre of games! Just the variety each civilation has and bonuses, not to mention when playing with friends it's just really fun! Overall just a great game and glad they remade it!"
"Dont read these go up and buy it, its good okay simple as that."
Created a bunch of monks and converted an entire enemy army. 10/10

"Easy to learn, but a bit boring at the start because you get rekt by everyone including your friends. Eventually gets addicting because the games are so close. I would recommend the expansion pack too, it includes some fun to play civilizations."
"friend: hey let's play you: ok  *CONNECTING F: Wololo you:? F:Hah nice town, i'll take it. Wololo. Gold please. Stone please.  you: *You played 2 hours to die like this?  F: WOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL 10/10"

"My favorite memes of AoE II (+expansions):  - 10 elephants fit on a boat, 11 archers don't.  - 6 archers, attack your castle.  - Scout passes by, entire army follows.  - March army against an enemy, everyone chases one villager.  - Get attacked by a group of ax throwers, not a single ♥♥♥♥ was given that day.  - A wolf attacks on of your villagers, keep chopping wood.  - Leftover units? Suicide Mission!!!  - Computer attacks in Dark Age, FUUUUUUUU-  - TREES!!, are more difficult to penetrate than stone walls.  - Build farms around Town Center, they never fit!!  - One Villager escapes, Rebuild Empire!  - Abandoned Lumber Camp in western plains, send 2 Trebuchets and 30 horsemen.  - Idle Villagers? Execute them!!  - Disregard Units, aquire currency.  - Rebuild Farms, MoooooooooooOOOoooooo  - Population limit reached, delete villagers.  - See enemy scout cavalry, 1st to attack wins.  - Crusaders are attacking trade routes, none gives a ♥♥♥♥.  - Teutonic Knight = Medieval Chuck Norris.  - Play Regicde, Fata$$ king outruns cavalry.  - Heroes with awesome fighting skill, stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from combat.  - Enemy soldiers walks by Bombard Tower, not a single hit.  - Build Fortress Walls, trade cart lets in enemy army.  - Repeatedly click houses, BONGO SOLO!!  - t. Alberto Barbosa   10/10 Would meme again"
"I cant stop playing this game. You think its old? think again, this game has held its playability for over 15 years and is still one of the most skill intensive rts' out there!  This game will be huge in a few years mark my words. TheViper is singlehandely bringing cmopetitve back to life. $30000 tournament in china last week! the game is growing once again.  Forget Boobly, Make Age great again!!!  Sinked plently of hours into it and I hope to sink many more! Made amazing friends through the aussie age community too!  Rating = 10/10, everything I want from an rts!!"
"classic,good game."
"This game is a musthave. It should be played by everyone atleast once if you are born before 2000. Gather some friends, challenge ea in combat. - You dont like this game? - Monk: Wolololo!  Now you like this game.  Great game, fully recommend. 10/10"

wololo this game
"15 years later and STILL endlessly replayable. The HD version comes with a few polished graphics here and there, but more importantly upscaled resolutions, streamlined hotkeys, new campaigns and some much needed rebalancing here and there.  I've played this ever since its release in 2000, and it never gets old."

This game is so gr8 :DDDD
"Amazing remake of the classic AoE2, By far the greatest military strategy game of all time, and the remake is a massive improvement on the original game. With the ability to have up to 500 men at one time you can build massive armies, with nearly no limit, and the new and improved Ai is great and unpredictable. The option to select real world maps is fun, and it runs smooth with very few bugs or glitches. The graphics improvement is mostly the water and fire, and not much else so don't expect a completely different looking game, but the graphics was probably the smallest improvement in this amazing remake. If you have not played age of empires I recommend you start with this one, by far the pinnacle of the series. There are also tonnes of campaigns, and if you finish them there is the new 'forgotten DLC.' So don't worry about running out of content in this virtually never-ending game there are also tonnes of civilizations to play as and dozens of play styles.  If you haven't got it I definitely recommend this remake of one of the greatest games of all time."
"Deleted the launcher to stop the game from crashing on startup, now the game always runs. Steam wont let me delete it, and I cant even delete the folder when steam process isn't running.  11/10 would delete launcher again"

Great game. It brings back old times. Best real time strategy game ever made.
"this game was my childhood, always fun to play this game."
"Just as how I remember it back in the day. I believe its come-back update was a fantastic move. Not only did it bring back precious, nostalgic memories for old players, but it brought back a refreshing light for the new. With additions like it's compatibility with the workshop, players can try out new user-made map scenarios, and are free to swap out textures, music and scripts to enhance the game that might seem aged. There is also a small development team constantly working on new content, fixing corrections and pumping out patches every so often. For new players and old, I cannot recommend picking up this game enough. It's wonderful to see a fifteen year old game still holding the test of time next to its modern, real-time strategy grandsons. If you do not have this game, get it now."
Every now and then it is time for a good old fashioned reminiscing session and this game definately tops the lists for childhood games!   Good to see a busy online community and the new expansion works well.
"Still one of my favorite games of all times! The Forgotten expansion also adds some sweet new civs and ups the difficulty, making it well replayable!"
Yes my lord? Yes my lord  10/10
"Well, it's an old game thrown on Steam. Sure it has HD edition in the title, but that could've just been added for the marketing value. So, what does it have?  Achievements Steam workshop The overlay works (!!!!) Multiplayer works New DLC (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  To any company looking to put their old game on Steam, THIS is how you should do it. Don't go with the minimum effort and expect people to pay what they would have back in the late ninetes for it.  Oh, yeah, and the game's really awesome, but the other reviews probably already told you that."
"What is seen by many as their earliest RTS experience, and the genesis for what we expect as the bare basics in modern RTS games. Returning to this game, I find it's much easier than I remember, but thankfully, there are difficult computer settings that really challenge me.  AoE does a pretty good job of applying 'regional templates' to buildings which may seem to paint with a bit broad of a brush but it infuses enough of a sense of difference that you do generally feel like you're playing your selected culture. Every one of them receive a special bonus of some sort to enhance them in a specific area, a unique soldier-type and a unique technology.  Quickly paced compared to a lot of RTS games, AoE II moves along at a pretty good pace, compared to games like Supreme Commander which, while excellent, are often an all evening affair, you can knock out three or four games in the same time easily with AoE II and experience many more factions in that time span.  The only con that I have yet to encounter, besides the relative broad brush I mentioned earlier that they paint different cultures with (all middle eastern / south east asian cultures have the same buildings, all native americans have the same buildings, all west eauropeans have the same buildings, etc, etc), are connection problems. If either of you have a hiccup in your connection, it often times just permanently drops that person with no chance for them to rejoin. Loading saves from these instances to pick up from have proven fruitless so far.  The first I can forgive. AoE II is extremely expansive in what it is trying to accomplish and what it does do given its age is absolutely amazing. I was blown away as a child and am still impressed today as an adult. The second is an awful lot of trouble and maybe it's user error but it is extremely frustrating. I would say this happens every one in three or four matches with a friend of mine.   Besides multiplayer, there is quite a lot of single player goodness, including campaigns based on historical events, although your mileage may vary on these as there's only so much you can do with some of these so they do not always follow the RTS play style but feel much more tactics based.  The music is.. well.. you'll have to listen for yourself, but it is definitely very memorable.  Just like pretty much everything about this game. It's really stood the test of time far better than I ever expected. Better than other, later games which have tried using its engine, at least.  So with that, it definitely gets a thumbs up from me!"
Awesome game! Been playing this for about 12 years now and I still love it. Absolutely timeless game.
Old but gold!
Best real time strategy ever. Wololo!
Loved this game. Must admit it was worth the money.
this game is cool no matter if its single player or multiplayer. i am not usually into these types of games but i sure enjoy this one! so if you like these types of games or want to try one i would deff say grad this one.
"A decent re-issue of a fantastic game. The updated graphics and resolution are great and the parts that aren't can be easily changed through mods, multiplayer now actually works which is lovely and the new expansion finally adds attack move.  There are however several lingering issues broken pathing and poor AI both friendly an enemy which doesn't feel at all human, though does offer some challenge on higher difficulties.  The expansion offers new campaigns which although have lower production values than the main game's are decent fun and a nice distraction from the mutliplayer/standard games. There are also new teams with some new architecture styles and interesting concepts (can't say much about balance just yet) and some general quality of life improvements such as the previously mentioned attack move.  Overall there has never been a better time to play Age of Empires II, and while the re-issue could be better it has successfully breathed new life into an all time classic."
"One of the best RTS games ever made. Wide variety of civilizations to choose from, each with ups and downs. Recommend highly."
Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing Metal.
"Suprisingly fun, and it actualy runs on my Win8 PC!! :D"
"Is exactly the same game as in 1999 come out, better graphics, multiplayer improved and also allows to use Steam workshop. Buy it in sales for 7 € . Recommended"
If you like strategy games you should buy Age Of Empires 2 HD
Classic &lt;3 loved the old and like the HD one but to expensive for an old game bought it on Sale! plz more sales for this.
"Great Game! It really brings me back to the days of playing AOE as a kid, worth 10$ anyday."
"Best RTS of all time, now works without issues in Windows 7/8 and multiplayer is supported. I love it."
"A lot of the bad press this game is getting is due to the fact that it is fairly similar to the original. For me, that's exactly what I was looking for (it's the best RTS ever made IMO). So if you're wondering whether or not to buy this DO NOT let the meta score put you off. If you enjoyed the original aoe2 then you will love this, plus you can find an outrageous amount of additional content in the Steam Workshop. From texture packs and maps, to hilarious Arnold Schwartzenegger audio taunts, and a whole lot more. I'm currently enjoying reliving my childhood aoe2 experience into my adult years, and it's awesome.  I hope someone finds this helpful."
Awsome game the online can be a pain to get into a room but when the game finalyl starts its good.
"Awesome game. Was playing it almost a decade ago when i couldn't even understand what was going on. Bought this game recently when it was remastered, and I hope to see what else will be implemented."
Third best Top down RTS I've ever played.
"Like ten years ago I wanted to play this with my friends. Now it's even easier, and it's just like the game used to be. Makes me feel like the young boy who only wanted to play this game again. The only thing is if you play with your friends.... it may ruin friendships. Totally worth it"
This game.... Like so many other people of our gaming generation we grew up around this wonderous game and for them to bring it back in HD was amazing :) With countless hours spent in the past and in the present on this game I highly recommend it and implore you to buy it now &lt;3
An excellent port that makes me think that Microsoft may have taken a turn for the better when it comes to their relations with the PC gaming community.
"Steam Workshop, Steamworks-based multiplayer, and to an extent the Forgotten Empires mod-turned-expansion-DLC are good points about this iteration.   But until the major bugs and performance problems are fixed (and some extras from community are added), I'd advise just getting the original, installing Userpatch, and playing on Voobly or Gameranger. Far smoother gameplay and more popular among the veterans."
"an awesome game, hours and hours of fun  i think they charge a little to much for it, i bought it at 50% off around 10-13€ would be a more fair price"
Classic!! Ive been having this game for 11 years. First started to play offline and I don't regret for getting this on steam to give me the opportunity to play online with other players. Best game ever!!
"Oh, how i have always loved this game. Thousands of hours ive spent playing my younger brother, networking on win 98 SE and win Xp,it was exciting, fun times. Glad to see it on steam, highly recommend to anyone. Addictive gameplay, wonderfully entertaining, please just play it."
"Age of Empires II HD  A refreshing new perspective on the classic game. Some aspects have really been improved, such as the framerate and a more dynamic water display. The ability to find new scenarios is easier than ever with Steam Workshop. Moreso, the standardized high resolution offers a much wider strategic view, giving the player a much better view of the map. The added mapsize by LudiKRIS is simply ENORMOUS, giving more scope, resources, and adding time to a random map or multiplayer game. Some pictures of units have been changed. Fire-animations are better and the game in general, plays a lot more fluently.  However, there are some initial downsides. First of all, the ability to host LAN-games has been removed, requiring an internet connection to play with friends. Though the options for online play have indeed been improved, removing the option of LAN-hosting seems a bit pointless and unneccesary.   Also, the price seems a bit too high for a game that essentialy is over a decade old. The current price of 19 euros, then, is a bit too much for those who are interested but do not exactly know what to expect. An extra 9 euros for The Forgotten DLC makes AoE II HD a 28 euro investment. The past Autumn Sale (2013) had the game on sale with a 75% cut, which made the game a more fitting 7 euro one. This seems a price that most players are willing to pay, though I personally believe that the standard price should be somewhere inbetween the 10 and 15 euro margin. Currently, the classic game and expansion are still on sale for 15 euros in most Eurozone countries.  Another critical issue is that the engine has not been altered enough to handle more men on the screen. During my second game, a scenario based on the SoIaF/GoT world, this becomes clear: As more buildings had been erected and the player is able to see more of the map through line of sight, the game slows a bit. This generally could have happened in the classic game as well, if all eight players had two hundred men active on the map.  For veteran AoE II players, the changes of the hotkeys can quite literally become a sore thumb. Those who have been playing for all these or again after all these years might be a bit annoyed that this has changed. However, as the Palisade Gate has been added it makes sense that some changes had to be made. In any case, it will take some time to adjust.   Still, the game is very much enjoyable and players can rediscover the classic game with its polished features. Online matchmaking now takes place via Steam which simply is a great improvement.  In addition, 'The Forgotten Expansion' features civilizations with great historic value that have, indeed, been 'forgotten' and subsequently left out in the classic game.  When playing the 'Age of Kings' campaigns in the classic game, you notice that certain medieval states such as Poland (in Barbarossa Campaign) had been represented by the Goths. Similarly, the Milanese and other Italian cities were represented by various civilizations in the Barbarossa and Attila the Hun campaigns, such as the Teutons, Franks and even Britons. These of course served to differentiate between cities and to make the game more fun to play (Let's face it: Fighting seven versions of the same civ in one game can be very boring).  The introduction of the Slavs, Italians, Magyars, each with their own characteristics and unique units, allows a much more thorough gameplay. The Italians do not need as much resources for Age advance and they and their team can recruit the quick but lethal Condottieri. Their castle unique unit, the Genoese Crossbowman, is an anti-cavalry archer. So far, this is the only 'Forgotten' civilization I have played, though I have played against two of the others. All of them seem promising. The architecture of the new Italian civilization seems to grasp certain elements that remind the player of medieval buildings still visible in Italy today.  Four new campaigns are added, allowing the player to continue discovering new stories, such as the Sforzas and Alaric the Visigoth. So far, I played the first scenario of the Sforza campaign, which adequately allows players to familiarize with the new Italian civ. The surroundings and layout of the scenario show the various improvements made to nature's elements, featuring tall grass and waterfalls.   But again, some critique is in order. First of all, the classic campaigns are not altered with the introduction of the new civs. To access classic campaigns, one must click on the AoE banner to switch back and forth between modes. Replacing the civilizations in these campaigns does not seem so difficult, as even in the scenario editor this can be done easily with little to no fuss, taking only little time.  An element that is missing in The Forgotten Campaigns are the voice-overs. These gave the Age of Kings and Conquerors campaigns a great deal of atmosphere and flavor, which made the campaigns more interesting. Veteran players remember that Age of Empires (1) did not have these voice-overs. However, they have formed a part of Age of Empires II campaigns that, in the eyes of many, seems irreplaceable.   Before writing this review, I have played three battles: One random map, one campaign scenario and one SoIaF/GoT scenario.   Overall, I am pleased that this classic game, well renowned and loved by many, received an HD adaptation. Certain compatibility issues with later versions of Windows had coloration effects on the game (That is, the weird display of reds and blues on water and land), which were quite annoying and had not been resolved (Unless explorer.exe was closed using Task Manager). The high resolution, animation changes and fixes make this game a bit more enjoyable, giving the player a greater strategic overhead view and a more fluent game. Though there are some downsides, such as price, left-out campaign voice-overs and lack of some enginetweaks, I still am pleased with the game and do not regret buying it during the Steam Autumn Sale.  I would render the game worth slightly more than Metacritic, giving it a 70 out of a 100, based on the points expressed above."
İt is perfect
"The granddadddy of the modern RTS game is back - and better than ever! While it's not the complete overhaul many wanted, it stays true to it's roots and the inclusion of Steam Matchmaking and Steam Workshop breathe fresth life into this classic title.  While it's graphics are a blast to the past, the gameplay holds up surprisingly well in the reboot. It's fast and fun. It doesn't have all of the features of a modern RTS, but that clearly isn't the aim of this game. The aim is to bring the fan favorite game of the past into the hands of the fans today, fully updated to work with your modern operating system and screen resolution.  -- THE FORGOTTEN --  The brand new DLC Expansion for this game - The Forgotten, adds an incredible amount of new content and updated features. It features game rebalance, new civilizations, new units, new scenarios and more. It also brings Twitch streaming, spectator mode, Steam cloud support, trading cards, and more. This Expansion alone breathes an incredible amount of life into the title and makes it completely relevant today as a competetive RTS game. Highly recommended."
Just as fun as I remember it! Simple fun.
"AOE2 still retains that awesome chaotic type of fighting experienced years ago. It's a blast lining up my archers to mow down an incoming squad of champions, but there seems to be a dwindling online community.   The game is definetly worth it to replay the campaign, but don't expect a revival of the multi-player scene. If you have friends to play this with, get all of them to buy it, because playing with your friends is still as fun as it used to be!"
They told me it was the best of the series. Bought it dead last from the series.. So true. Like Age of Empires 1 on steroids. Age of empires 3 is its own thing.
Please release a OSX version!
This game is a good game.
"The best game of my childhood.  Buy this, highly recommended"
wasted my childhood behind this ♥♥♥♥. now wasting my adulthood behind this ♥♥♥♥ again.  10/10 would recommend.
"Resolution has greatly improved, bought this game in the Christmas Sale for $3.99, I highly recommend it for any price. Multiplayer has improved immensely, and works great."
"Game is challenging, but addictive... I"
Old but GOLD !!! EPIC GAME !!!
"Great, plus better graphics than the original."
"Great game, especially when you're playing with friends. It needs work for multiplayer connectivity, anything over 3 players lags pretty badly, especially on large maps with alot of units. (Not our PC's or network either, gigabit backbone and everyone has a gaming PC of somesort).  Definately grab it if you and your friends need somthing fun to play and got some time to kill"
"When I was younger and playing on the ps2 with this game I was addicted to it constantly just playing skirmish with highest amount of produce and on a random map and my favorite group was the brits because of not that I am british its because I loved there special soldier of the longbow man and now my ps2 is not in the best of conditions and I am on the ps4 now and the pc. I checked my emails for the spam of course because I love reading them and I came across an email from humble bundle saying about an age of empire 2 sale so as soon as I seen it I had to have it so i bough it and redeemed the code It was like I back when there was ps2 but this time it did not take a week to get to the other side of the map and this time I can cheat yeah I know. But the cheats are strange because you can spawn in a car which is OP which i find funny because I just send them off instead to kill them and also i hive binded my custom keys with the cheats of aoe ( robin hood, lumberjack, rock on, cheese steak jimmy's ) Even if this game was not from your younger times you can still play it because its an enjoyible game   10/10 - Would stab a castle till its destoryed again    "

"Such a good game, true to the original game. Installing the old game on new computers meant that the game couldn't keep up and the eagles were black squares across the screen.... Definitely needed this game back though just more up to the task of running on current PCs."
This game is awesome! Just get some friends who have it and You'll play for hours at a time! t's so fun. I Recommend this game! It's awesome! if you get it maybe we'll play together ;).
Great game espcially for RTS lovers. when you first get it start with bots on singleplayer because online is VERY HARD. great mix if things to do and lots of civs to choose from with their own pros/cons. I highle recommend this game and is a great deal for the price.  (the fact that this game was released over a decade ago and is still in the top 100 games played on steam says something too)
Played this game when I was still in elementary.  Played it during my high school years.  Still playing it now (I'm in college).  Probably the best video game I had ever played.  11/10
One of my favorite games of all time!
It's fun.
A Very strategice game and fun.
Best RTS ever? Yes. Good remake? Yes. Workshop support? Yes. You now have no reason to not buy this game.
i love this game but its not working it crashes after u click play
Dis game veddy fahn
"This Game is awesome! Would recommend to anyone who enjoys Sid Meijers Civilization games, because this game is ten times better, but a similar game. :D"
"Age of Empires, good stuff."
"Someone showed me this after playing 0AD, and it's really great if you're into expanding your civilization, building an army and taking on other settlements. I found it especially fun versing my friends. Your typical battle between empires."
LUV IT FEED IT NEVER LEAVE IT!
Back to the roots! Say hi to history!
"Mark stole my gold. 10/10  ♥♥♥♥ the chinnese, ♥♥♥♥ the indians, ♥♥♥♥ the italians, ♥♥♥♥ the mongols, ♥♥♥♥ the aztecs, ♥♥♥♥ the mayans, ♥♥♥♥ every civilization that ever rushed me with archers.  Wololo"
"Played this game for a long time as a kid, got it for a birthday one year. Think my dad saw Microsoft and thought it was an educational thing. Still holds up well today. Great game, worth getting the add on DLC too (The forgotton). One of them classics like the old Command And Conquers's, never gets old.  only bad side is no zoom!  "
Everything you remember it being.
"i make it simple, It's a great Game no questions about that. If you liked the standard game you will like the HD remake to, with the Forgotten features you can't go wrong, it's balanced and it's fun!  There is just the point about the MP lagg, if you don't like to have a 50/50 chance to get a laggfree Game, don't buy it. Simple as that. Wait for an decent fix then get it. It's still hella fun when you get a fine working game with friends or random dudes :)   So i stay with Yes to buy the game, but keep in mind the laggs will make it hard to love it."
Write a review for a game i dont have 10/10.
"Top game in general. Pretty cool, oldschool. The only problem is the troopmovement because they get stuck really fast."
This is like an old gem you find at a retirement home and bring home with you. It may be wrinkely and smell funny but it still gets the job done right. You may find the denchers on the ground the next morning but that just made the night better. You may find yourself thinking 'hey I could get some friends together and we can really go to town' but you change your mind and relize you dont have any friends so you contine your lifes work to shine this old bitty up and make her presentible to your parents to only find no matter how many clothespins you use you can't hide every wrinkel.
This game is so fun to play 
its ite
4.5/10 old but still just OK (like it always was)
Awesome Game have always loved it since it first came out!
"An upgraded version of a timeless classic, with both excellent single and multiplayer components. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the RTS genre."
Wololo
A classic strategy game with quality which is not seen often in games anymore.
"Age of Empires 2 has always held a special place in my heart. It is without a doubt my favourite of the AOE franchise and has no chance of falling from favour. I give it 5 out of 5, and this version still does it justice and brings home the goods"
"Definitely Fun game! Played this growing up. Played it multiplayer in Lan, and now its ONLINE only makes it more fun and challenging. Def recommend! Get it and play with your friends!"
"Completely unplayable in multiplayer mode. I played this game for a long time without problems, and a few months ago (maybe a year now Im not sure exactly how long) there was an update to the AI. Since that point there is horrible lag spikes to the point where the game is not playable. Im running an AMD quad core with 8 gigs of ram and a good GPU and still have horrible lag."
Love this game!
"Ok, so first of all this is the greatest (strategy) game of all time. And you should buy this. You might say, however, that you already own the classic, non-hd edition, and you are wondering why in the world you should buy the HD edition. Because it's HD? Maybe, but that's not your main reason. Your main reasons are: 1- Because it works smooth on the newer operating systems and 2- Because multiplayer is pretty darned smooth. And what's better than AoE? AoE with friends.  And now for the Forgotten DLC. It is... a decent DLC, but it pretty heavily depends on your personal preference. It ads a few  nations, but it also adds quite a few campaigns. And these campaigns are quite unlike the original AoE campaigns. Matter of fact, the Forgotten campaigns focus on somewhat forgotten battles (as the name suggests) and the campaigns largely follow a narrative path. In other words, these campaigns revolve a lot more around the storyline. In addition, the new campaigns look abolutely smashing; well designed from an aesthetic point of view. I should note, however, that these campaigns are kind of dull. So in the end: the campaigns look nice, tell the story very well indeed, but unfortunately they are kinda dull. Great if you are interested in history or aesthetics, but if you are just here for the gameplay you might be disapointed.  Final verdict: 9/10"
"A lot of the bad press this game is getting is due to the fact that it is fairly similar to the original. For me, that's exactly what I was looking for (it's the best RTS ever made IMO).

Loved this game. Must admit it was worth the money.
"This game is just like the original, and Microsoft's definition of 'HD' is apparently 'runs on Windows 7;' but that's OK because the original was an amazing game. If you played the original, then think the game a decade ago, but with Steam Achievements and better Multiplayer support.  If you didn't play the decade ago, then think of Starcraft, but set in medieval times and without the same level of questionably legitimate tactics."
"AOE2 still retains that awesome chaotic type of fighting experienced years ago. It's a blast lining up my archers to mow down an incoming squad of champions, but there seems to be a dwindling online community.

"When you think about games that came down to you when you were a child, maybe an medieval RTS doesn't forcefully pop first than things like Mario, Zelda or Pokemon. That was... not my case.   When I was 6 years old my mom bought Conquerors and teached me a very darn basic concept of the game. I got hanged, heavily. I didn't understand why but I loved the campaigns, I was obscenely bad at the game. But I liked it  a  lot  . And then as I grew I got a better understanding, but my love somewhat diminished because I was ignorant of the AOE2 community being alive as hell. Being clueless about the such AoC passed to be a good memory. Then one day of 2014 one video pops in my YouTube feed about AoE2. I watch and remember some dumb things like the wololo rush. And there it is. A recommendation about AOE2HD.     wait  65watts . But not only that, because I knew about this game until way later there was also a  new expansion  called  The Forgotten . It were the 10 most epic seconds of my life (watching the intro). And then I just had to get it. I love it even more than ever, the community is vibrant, I keep coming with new ways to play it with friends and new AIs, graphic mods left and right. But the best part about it is that AOE2 is probably the game that I've seen live the most and the fact it's going strong really gets me going.   And the ' worse ' part comes: It will have another mother effing expansion. You just won't see a bit of that effort in things like Diablo 2. God ♥♥♥♥ing damn it.  I love this game. "
Great improvement onto the original while keeping the nostalgia alive. 9/10 (Can be a little bad on FPS in battles)
"Brings back lots of memories. No graphical improvements, though, so you may want to download a texture pack. Good that is has Steam Workshop support. Overal a great classic still worh playing."
Dont even know how to describe this game. Cannot in the time that I have left on this planet...Just get it!
"This is a great game. This is what got me into gaming. The HD version isnt much different to the Disc version but still worth every penny. If you have the extra, definitely get the forgotten expansion. The new civs are great. It is definitely a MUST have."
"The original Age of Empires II was one of the first games I ever played- and even today is one of my favorite.  Years ago, I had actually purchased the Mac version of this game, and greatly enjoyed playing it on my old system. I'm surprised how long I could keep this game running, and I'd keep coming back to it OS update after OS update, happy to find it still ran perfectly. Unfortunately, my luck didnt last, and the game became too old for my system to run. I put my disc away and, for the most part, forgot about it.   Eventually, I threw a copy of Windows 7 on my computer, eager to try all the games I was missing out on. Upon firing up steam and seeing Age of Empires II HD Edition- I had no choice but to grab myself a copy.  Overall, the game hasn't changed at all in terms other than graphics; where it has improved. For anyone in a position similar to me, it's the same exact game you played all those years ago. $20 might seem a little steep at first, but if you ever see this game on sale: there's no reason not to buy it."
"Nostalgia truely takes over playing this again, and it's just as fun, if not more so, now just like it was 10 years ago. 10/10"
The best middle age settled RTS I ever played! Since 1999!
"Brings back lots of memories. No graphical improvements, though, so you may want to download a texture pack. Good that is has Steam Workshop support. Overal a great classic still worh playing."
This game has held its value from its release date in 1999 all the way to today and beyond. The Forgotten update did a very good job at adding some new things to an old game. It is very cool that they still can bring new content to such an old and amazing game.
Brst Game RTS seris ive ever played
"Age of Empires II HD is a great remake of the classic RTS AoE II. The engine and graphics have been improved a bit and SteamWorks multiplayer has been added, but otherwise the game is left intact. I highly recommend this game and also The Forgotten expansion, which adds a bunch of great new campaigns."
"My favorite RTS of all time and one of the first PC games I got hooked on, just go buy it... RIGHT NOW"
"friend: hey let's play you: ok  *CONNECTING F: Wololo you:? F:Hah nice town, i'll take it. Wololo. Gold please. Stone please.  you: *You played 2 hours to die like this?  F: WOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL 10/10"
"Dont read these go up and buy it, its good okay simple as that."
Wololo
"this game is 16 years old, yet it's still as entertaining now as it was then. the dlc and acheivements continues to keep the game interesting. the game can occasionally be buggy, the active community means the bugs are picked up and patched regularly."
it's sick tho i love it.
"A genre-defining must-play classic of RTS remastered in HD. The original based-on-a-true story epic. This game has a ridiculous amount of content. TWENTY fully scripted and voice-acted campaigns (and still counting) @5+ hours each. Worth its price several times over, especially on sale.  Then theres multiplayer! 29 semi-unique civilizations with historically accurate, albeit imbalanced, strengths and weaknesses. Graphics and AI are hugely improved over the original game. Great mods. Didn't honestly think I'd come back to this game again given what else is on the market (unplayed in my library), yet here we are. 11/10 currently playing again."
"Awesome game. Good play, good strategy, good game.!  Are You Indonesian player? Open here :  http://www.kaskus.co.id/thread/547acdcda4cb17966a8b456a/official-age-of-empires-ii-hd--the-forgotten-steam-amp-online-multi-player "
Enjoying the game for many years always something to do
"This is a must have for any RTS gamer since it's really the one that brought the genre to the forefront. If you already own the game, then getting this is also recommended since it's optimized for modern systems and supports steam online play. The HD remake was unfortunately riddled with bugs at release but most of these seem to have been fixed. However even though online 'works' and there is a sizeable population, the HD remake still is plagued with many of the problems that affected the original AoE2 such as random out of syncs, atrocious lag every other game, and players dropping randomly. These are problems more to do with AoE2 itself and are not unique to the HD remake.  As for the expansions, thankfully you can filter multiplayer games according to which DLC is required. I would say that The Forgotten is easily forgotten (no pun intended) since the campaign scenarios lack any narration and really although the civs have new art styles, the only one that people seem to use are the Incas. The African Kingdoms on the other hand is a true solid expansion pack. The campaigns are very well polished and are narrated. It's also a blast to play as the Berbers, Portuguese and the Ethiopians. I just wish that both xpacks got the same treatment but apparently The Forgotten was already a fan made modification that was just modified further for commercial release whereas the African Kingdoms was a fresh new xpack. All in all though the online community for this game is still fairly active suprisingly after all these years and it's welcoming to all skill levels."
Age of empires stems back in my time right back to the beginning of the classic 'cream pc's' its the bread and butter of my pc gamming and the fuel that satisfies my needs to endulge in endless hours of building and combat.  Age of Empires is a game that will never go old and outdated. There are plenty of single player campaign missions to complete but the combat side of things never ends. Multiplayer that has been revived back in this HD version has enlightened me into getting back into it and it has done so for many other fans of this genre. There are countless strategies to be used and the added 500 population bonus is a positive addition to the game as it adds that realism back in. There are over 20 civilisations you can play as and each one has their own strengths and weaknesses. This game comes at a cheap price which is appealing and especially when its on sale.  **WARNING IT WILL CONSUME YOUR LIFE**  10/10 will fight again.
I never had a childhood and played it for several hours . As miss this game. Grade 10/10
Even Though I got this game yesterday it is still fun even though im not good at it i totally recommend this game for all types of gamers!
Best game ever better then csgo Rekomend to buy during the steam sale.
Its the kitties ♥♥♥♥♥♥s
great graphic's great gameplay   a relic from when micsoft knew how to make games  10/10
"If you get it for your friends on a sale and they dont know how to play it that well, show those peasents no mercy."
One of the best games I have ever played in my life.
If you build alot of petards your friends will get mad at you.   10/10
Ethnic cleansing not included in the base game. 14/88
"Played as a child, played as an adult. Great RTS."
"Seriously, a great game :)"
♥♥♥♥ing awesome Game. Old is gold. Recommended for everyone :)
I should play this more
"Whenever a game from 1999/2000 still holds grounds to todays games of it's kind, it means something. This game is great, and the expansions balanced few civilizations nobody played, added new ones with unique sinnergy, so if you enjoy strategy games, then you want this game."

Its one of those games that you play because of nestolgia but it still holds up in my opinion!
wicked !
Never been bothered by the sound of dead farms ever more in my life. 10/10

Classic.
"Probably the best HD remake by Microsoft so far.And the new packs are actually good. If you enjoyed the original game,trust me,you will feel the same about this one (maybe even slighty better)"
"too good, please nerf."
"12 year old me was amazing at this game. 27 year old me... well not so much, but I love it all the same!"
This game gave me smiles when I was a kiddo and now I play it again as an adult and giggle like a little school girl. Play this game like a boss!
Played this game when I was still in elementary.  Played it during my high school years.  Still playing it now (I'm in college).  Probably the best video game I had ever played.  11/10
"Oh man, I played countless hours with the old version...  Pros: - Enjoying singleplayer with lots of interesting campaigns - Tutorial teaches the RTS basics well, so the game is accessible to new players - A very well scalable, challenging AI for the standard maps (keep in mind that the HD version AI got scaled up compared to the old version.) - Lots of various civilizations to play with - Extremely well balanced on a competitive level. Both the civilizations and the units have a kinda rock-paper-scissors relationship. - Improved game supports large resolutions and huge populations now, so everything is set for huge offensives - You can actually learn some medieval history from this! There is a detailed encyclopedia, and the campaigns depict the lives of historical figures and events. - Nobody will ever max the achievements, but that doesnt mean you cannot keep trying  Cons - Graphics look outdated, may be a hindrance to anybody who looks for flashy-looking games - Despite saying so, the tutorial teaches nothing about PVP, you gotta look it up online if you wanna stand a chance - You kill llamas for food"
"Much of my childhood was spent playing this game, and it feels good to be able to play it again (considering my current pc won't run my old discs)"
This game gave me smiles when I was a kiddo and now I play it again as an adult and giggle like a little school girl. Play this game like a boss!
cool game
"Such a good game, true to the original game. Installing the old game on new computers meant that the game couldn't keep up and the eagles were black squares across the screen.... Definitely needed this game back though just more up to the task of running on current PCs."
This game is awesome! Just get some friends who have it and You'll play for hours at a time! t's so fun. I Recommend this game! It's awesome! if you get it maybe we'll play together ;).
Relived my childhood 10/10
Good old Classic game.......im used to playing Age of Empires 3 but this is way better to me......8/10 
"A remake I long waited for. It's the old Age of Empires, just in graphics that don't paint your seas purple and your grass red.  "
One of my favorite games of all time!
THE BEST GAME EVER!!! just a few glitches to fix and its the best!
It's fun.
A Very strategice game and fun.
Best RTS ever? Yes. Good remake? Yes. Workshop support? Yes. You now have no reason to not buy this game.
i love this game but its not working it crashes after u click play
"A classic empire building game, some aspects of the game could have done with a bit more polish but overall it's a very standard and fun RTS game."
"Age of Empires II that runs on my 27' dispaly and looks great, enough said."
"This was the game of my life when I was young... I love the new one and I can't wait to de-rust myself. Thanks for doing this, I don't think any other game like this can beat the awesomeness of it, not even AOE3."
"Fun strategy game, very simple to play, and always a blast to play the El Cid Campaign."
"To this day, this competes for the title of the best RTS game.   I wouldn't say the actual campaign has aged well.. considering there is no voice overs for any dialogue, the objectives are typically very vague, and can be difficult to accomplish. Failing a mission in Age of Empires 2 is terrible, because the game is extremely slow paced.  It's true glory comes from the multiplayer aspect. These games can go on for hours as multiple players build kingdoms so large they collide into one another at a epic scale. Macro managing your buildings, defenses, and resource collection can feel almost overwhelming as tons of workers are going every which way. I do have to say however the combat is lacking... the AI isn't very smart, and it can be difficult to get your army to do simple tasks.  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into real time strategy games, but DOES NOT like the fast paced nature of games like starcraft. This game is more for people who enjoy building and resource management in a more slow paced environment."
"I have clocked 162 hours of this on Steam, but I must have played it several thousand hours since it's release in 1997, though. Just buy it - it's the best stratagy game ever created, and you'll get unlimited entertainment."
Played this as a kid was fun then and i still fun now!

"I've bought 7 copies of this game, about to buy my 8th."
"For those who loved the original, have no fear, this is it back in all its glory.  With the incredible improvement in graphics that could have mired this game and made it weaker, the developers left the game as it stood when it played on Windows 95, just updated so that we can enjoy this epic game once again."
"I love this game, granted it has quite a lot of nostalgia for me. But Age of Empires 2 is perhaps one of my favorite RTSs of all time. I spent countless hours as a kid playing it on my computer, and now spend even more playing online with my friends. There are aspects that Age of Empires 3 just could not capture and I am very happy they came out with a remake!  The only draw back currently is that you cannot save online multiplayer games and reload them. However, that does not take away from the enjoyment of the game at all."
love this game
Classic rts
Played this game when I was still in elementary.  Played it during my high school years.  Still playing it now (I'm in college).  Probably the best video game I had ever played.  11/10
When you play this game with your friends its feels ♥♥♥♥ing AWESOME!!! WOLOLOOOOOO
"I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door."
"I used to play this game when I was a child, it's always been great. This a great continuation with a better multiplayer, and the expansion is pretty good."
Hooked on this ♥♥♥♥ again.
"12 year old me was amazing at this game. 27 year old me... well not so much, but I love it all the same!"
This wasthe first game I ever played. Windows XP pentuim duo ahh the memorys. Seeing the game that founded my video gaming passion remade in HD almost brought tears to my eyes. This game is basicly like Clash of ♥♥♥♥INGclans just without the Gems ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
Pretty much the same as dota 2 but with more heros.
"Definitely a very well-done RTS game with all the mechanics that make an RTS great. Easy to understand, yet still complex enough to keep you intrigued. Reccommend to any fans of games like Starcraft or Civilization."
I have spent hundreds of hours on this game. It was my first PC game and sparked my love of history.  It's RTS at its finest. I think the HD Edition just makes it more accessible but its still the best damn RTS.  10/10
10/10 ign will wololo again
gud one rite here
"Never really played RTS games before, but this is a lot of fun!"
"An absolute classic. Absolutely addicting, unfortunately."
the 4.0 UP GRADE has buggered it all up 
Classic.
"too good, please nerf."
"Great PC classic. Even though the AI can behave like a man with brain damage (Well, it IS dated), it makes up for that with fun and challenging gameplay. You can build your own maps and load up a game however you desire as well."
"Probably the best HD remake by Microsoft so far.And the new packs are actually good. If you enjoyed the original game,trust me,you will feel the same about this one (maybe even slighty better)"
"Except the DLC (African) the remake is OK, not HD but with better textures. Yes, it was not a hard work, but is OK. Also the Forgotten Empires is a great expansion with good campaings and features. The only problem is that has not voices in the campaign and that's annoying. Just you must to be careful installing some mods (Like Terrain mods) because can lag the game as h€ll and causing problems in online. Well, that was in my own experience. Decent remake. "
real fun and like super cool tbh
"Great game,same as the original Age of Empires 2 with the DLC and everything,slightly HD-ish version of it.I cant really tell the difference aside from the water textures,but you can improve it even more using the Steam Workshop.As of the Forgotten,great campaigns,great map design,great innovation from the developers,absolutely phenomenal piece of game :)"
"**Please note that I'm going to review this as it's own thing, and not a remake since I never played the orignal when I was younger**  I wasn't a PC gamer back in the glory days of RTS's so I wasn't sure what to think of the genre. AoE2 is the RTS I ever played (about a year ago), and my reaction is that it is a very good game. I was iffy about it, thinking that it was one of those games that could only be fun if you're playing with friends, but random map is still fun playing aganst COM's (obviously it's funner with friends, but not unplayable without them).   I think the thing I like most about AoE2 is the amount of different things you can change in a random map game (Which is something I missed in AoE3)."
Why are you even considering? Buy it!

Love this game. Thrilling and tests your ability to devise the most cunning strategies!
lots of childhood memories in this game lol
this gam is a barel uf fun
"A blast from the past that may handle a bit funky, but is certainly entertaining. It is quite surprising how well it holds up today, and the unthinkable notion they are making more stuff for it! Badass!"
"  A Real Time Strategy classic - one couldn't possibly argue with that. Be sure to buy it if you're into RTS!  Also a great game to start playing RTS if you're new to the genre. Together with Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2, it's easily the most popular RTS of the late 90's."
"Ahhhh, Age of Empires II HD. This game is THE perfect RTS game to start with. I remember playing this on my grandparents computer when I was a tot and I recently discovered that there was a HD remake for it and I just couldn't keep my wallet in my pocket!   RTS games aren't really my forté but I can tell you that personally this is 10/10 without a doubt the best RTS game there has ever been."
The game of my youth.
Decided to play against some other peoplez. One of them alied me I killed the others (There were 7 others) and he then declared war on me when he only had 7 SPEARMEN. Easiest game ever. 11/10 Would decimate again.
"Hate the new music, although the game is Legendary!"
"Remastered in HD, new graphics, everything has been remastred, recommended 11/10."

"Personally my favorite game from the 90's out there. Don't have to worry about running it, my horrible laptop even shreds it. If you're looking for a classic to play, this is it, by far."
"I start playing this game, not knowing what to expect because I played it last about 2 years ago. So, I decide I need some food to make more villagers. Good plan, right? I go to attack some hogs outside of my village and then it kills 2 of the 3 villagers I had from starting.   A random monk walks through my village and I of course kill that little ♥♥♥♥. I didn't know what the relic did, and then I was in a state of confusion as I could not pick it up as I did not have a monk and could not create one at the time. So, I send a villager over to see if I could pick it up, and then another monk strolls into my village, takes the relic back, and leaves.  Trying to build up my village, I notice some enemy villagers strolling into my village and literally stealing my resources. I, of course, was like 'LOL ♥♥♥♥ NO KIDS' and then attacked one of them with my cavalry. The villager killed the cavalry in one hit and then walked away. They continued to steal resources and set up a lumber mill in my god damn village.  That said, 11/10 will definitely play again."

"What can I say? I played Age of Empires 2, together with my father when i was a child.  This game is timeless. I play the HD-Edition sometimes with friends and we have fun like back in 2000. The only thing, that should be done better is the synchronisation. The Game is often lagging in epic battles.  But all in all, this game is the best of its kind! Wololooooohhhhh!"
"I grew up with this game, and I've probably played it for 1000 hours outside steam on my old windows 98. If you are a fan of the old game, then I strongly recommend you to get this steam version. It's the same game, but it's playable on new computers, and the workshop mods and multiplayer will keep the game alive for years to come. The single-player is however what I like the most, and it's really nice to see it return with improved graphics. My favorite strategy game is finally back!"

"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 220 degrees C 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 175 degrees C, and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
"This game is a musthave. It should be played by everyone atleast once if you are born before 2000. Gather some friends, challenge ea in combat. - You dont like this game? - Monk: Wolololo!  Now you like this game.  Great game, fully recommend. 10/10"

This game is very fun and in some cases difficult and really makes you strategize, it's also very addicting and easy to learn, but hard to master. BUY IT NOW!!! :D"
Excellent real time strategy game. I may be a bit biased in my review because this game made my childhood but it is an amazing game none the less and I hope everyone gives it a try

Really good job with reviving this game and its graphics and I'm expecting you to continue working on this, not that it really needs anything more it's quite awesome as it is :D"
Buy this ♥♥♥♥ its old and amazing!
"One of the first games I have ever played, refurbished. Classic resource gathering RTS, with the atmosphere of non other!"
"This is one of the best RTS games of all time. The voice packs for the different civilizations, the background music, the in-game sounds, the menu music, everything is pure eargasm. The art style is extremely artistic without being too cartoony or too realistic and achieves a perfect balance. The gameplay is pretty deep although most of the depth is from actual execution rather than game or civlization knowledge. The Multiplayer is an absolute blast and can offer hundreds of hours of entertainment. A (nearly) perfect game and definitely the best in the entire AoE series.  Verdict: 9.5/10 (Outstanding)"

"The game is hard enough to play on a 32 inch monitor in 1080p, if you're looking to play it in 1440p or 4k it gets even worse, I don't see why the UI does not scale, you seriously have to play this in 720p on a 32 inch in order to see your resources without planting your face in the monitor. On top of that, you cannot change your resoution, it has to match your desktop, so you have to change your desktop resolution back and forth. There are external programs to fix this, but I've always had issues with those when trying to use it on other games, in the end, I got a refund because an HD Edition of a game should not be inferior on HD resolutions."

"My favorite memes of AoE II (+expansions):  - 10 elephants fit on a boat, 11 archers don't.  - 6 archers, attack your castle.  - Scout passes by, entire army follows.  - March army against an enemy, everyone chases one villager.  - Get attacked by a group of ax throwers, not a single ♥♥♥♥ was given that day.  - A wolf attacks on of your villagers, keep chopping wood.  - Leftover units? Suicide Mission!!!  - Computer attacks in Dark Age, FUUUUUUUU-  - TREES!!, are more difficult to penetrate than stone walls.  - Build farms around Town Center, they never fit!!  - One Villager escapes, Rebuild Empire!  - Abandoned Lumber Camp in western plains, send 2 Trebuchets and 30 horsemen.  - Idle Villagers? Execute them!!  - Disregard Units, aquire currency.  - Rebuild Farms, MoooooooooooOOOoooooo  - Population limit reached, delete villagers.  - See enemy scout cavalry, 1st to attack wins.  - Crusaders are attacking trade routes, none gives a ♥♥♥♥.  - Teutonic Knight = Medieval Chuck Norris.  - Play Regicde, Fata$$ king outruns cavalry.  - Heroes with awesome fighting skill, stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from combat.  - Enemy soldiers walks by Bombard Tower, not a single hit.  - Build Fortress Walls, trade cart lets in enemy army.  - Repeatedly click houses, BONGO SOLO!!  - t.

"A classic stylish game, with so much replay value. Graphics are perfect for this type of game (fits genre very well) Great game to spend multiple hours with friends trying to survive long enough to build an army. Pretty much all game modes have a different but all around fun time to them; with plenty of them. It is a steal for only 20$. If you have the money and time to play this game, i would definitely get it."
Classic!
"Ok so there hasn't been much added but the ability to install it on win7, 1900x1080, and a tiny bit of upresing, but man this game still holds up as one of the best RTS's of all time. This ranks no.2 on my top 5 RTS games.(The original DOW series being no.1) If you're like me and loved this game since the 90's but are having trouble running older copies on newer systems then this is totally worth the price. If your used to newer type games and graphics and haven't played it before, then I would recommend waiting for at least a 50% off sale."
I've liked AOE for a long time. I like to be able to play this game with friends all at the same time.
good when noob ♥♥♥♥♥ dont use ♥♥♥♥ing gay ♥♥♥♥♥ strats
A great HD reboot of a classic game!
"Played the snot out of this game back in the late 90s. I would love to still play the snot out of the HD version. Due to 'script error awesome chub style hyper tournament edition super carnage 2014', I am unable to play. Do not let that stop you! The best RTS games ever made, in my opinion, are Age of Empires 2 and Warcraft 2. I still recommend this game!   10/10 Juicy RTS romance."
Old Games Never Die !!! It was \ is a very good game to play even now. I RECOMMEND it.
"The game is hard enough to play on a 32 inch monitor in 1080p, if you're looking to play it in 1440p or 4k it gets even worse, I don't see why the UI does not scale, you seriously have to play this in 720p on a 32 inch in order to see your resources without planting your face in the monitor. On top of that, you cannot change your resoution, it has to match your desktop, so you have to change your desktop resolution back and forth. There are external programs to fix this, but I've always had issues with those when trying to use it on other games, in the end, I got a refund because an HD Edition of a game should not be inferior on HD resolutions."

"This game is simpily amazing, My dad taught me how to play this when i was 7 and I got hooked. We spent Probably Hundreds of hours playng lan games together since, now 13 years later and we still have the occasional lan game. This game will always be my number 1 favorite not just For the game itself But for the Memories that were made playing with my dad"
"This game brings me a lot of nostalgia. I used to play this for hours on end on my first two computers: an ancient Mac laptop, and an ancient crappy iMac (hint: it runs well on low end computers). This was my favorite game in my early childhood, and while granted I was horrible at it and made sure I figured out the cheat codes to it so that I wouldn't have to worry about handling my resources, I still loved it A LOT.  I saw this on Steam at one point last year, and as I recalled hundreds of hours of gameplay years before, I knew that I needed this game on Steam, because it is: a game I treasured, redefined in numerous ways, better AI, better graphics, more civilizations, etc...this game is a joy to play  This game is fairly simple-seeming on the outside, but it's so deep and complex on the inside. It is a medieval-themed RTS, where you choose a civilization and try to defeat others via being the last to survive, having your king to be the last to survive, controlling a monument, building a (World) Wonder and having it stand for a few hundred years (which somehow equates to like a second a minute, which considering everything else doesn't make much sense, but I'll let that slide), and more. Face up to 7 other civilizations ranging from Easiest difficulty (aka pathetic and stupid) to Hardest (Which you need to be a god-like RTS master in order to defeat, considering I have trouble even on the Standard difficulty, 3 levels down from that). There's a huge variety of maps to play on, some of them based off of real-life places....there's just so many options on the specifications of that game.  But that's not all. Campaigns. With the expansion, there's probably over a dozen campaigns, each with probably three to five levels, but I wouldn't know, since I find them to be, as a majority, notoriously hard (because the odds are HEAVILY stacked against you, even on the easiest difficulty available). However, they're so great to try, because you're attempting to follow the paths of some the medieval times' greatest (or worst) people (depending on your point of view): Attila the Hun, Joan of Arc, and Charlemange, to name just a few.  This game is accurate too. The people who created this game made sure everything was historically accurate, and present you with loads of information about the weapons, eras, civilizations, and more that can be found in the game.  There's so much good to cover in this game, but I'll let you unearth more about this yourself.  TL;DR:  + Historically accurate + Diverse options with which to base each game you play around + Keeps you on your toes constantly, never gets old --&gt; endlessly replayable + Cheats (if you're a scrub!!!!!!) + Timeless = Can require a lot of skill, practice, and understanding of the game to succeed - Can be very difficult at times, to the point of frustration  3π+0.5/10 (≈9.9/10)  GET THIS GAME AND YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINT."

"A beautiful revamp of a genre defining game. I only had to watch the opening cutscene to relive the memories. Everything from the farms to the sea to the character and building models look much nicer while still retaining it's classic and retro look for example the fire; the flames themselves look awesome, but the shimmer around the edge looks incredibly retro. My only problem is the lack of ability to zoom in or out because I find the buttons slightly too small along with the text, but that is just me with my poor eye-sight.  A great game, now only waiting on AoE 4, but I fear that'll be a wait in vein."
My favorite strategy game.
"Just as how I remember it back in the day. I believe its come-back update was a fantastic move. Not only did it bring back precious, nostalgic memories for old players, but it brought back a refreshing light for the new. With additions like it's compatibility with the workshop, players can try out new user-made map scenarios, and are free to swap out textures, music and scripts to enhance the game that might seem aged. There is also a small development team constantly working on new content, fixing corrections and pumping out patches every so often. For new players and old, I cannot recommend picking up this game enough. It's wonderful to see a fifteen year old game still holding the test of time next to its modern, real-time strategy grandsons. If you do not have this game, get it now."
Old but gold!
Awesome game! Been playing this for about 12 years now and I still love it. Absolutely timeless game.
"Excellent, fun, strategy heavy classic.  If you are in it for the fun of it and have a lot of time to kill, serious candidate for your next purchase here, I must admit there is a long list of 'wtf logic' moments, like camels being categorized as boats or those tiny one story houses housing 5 bunkbedding elephants/boats, but it makes for a good laugh.  Great game, fully recommend. 9.4/10  Edit 11/24/16: Nominated for ´´Test of Time´´ Steam Award"
The remaster of a classic game that made my childhood fun! Online still needs fixes to be great.

"It's incredible how good this game still is today considering its age. On every aspects, be it strategy, features, graphics, campaigns, game modes, modding, ..."
.
Age of Empires 2 is the pillar of RTS games most people would probably say i am wrong and mention another that came out before either AOE's but i think this one grabbed a larger more diverse audience world wide. A must have in your RTS Genre a 9/10. Game is over 15 years old and still going strong nuff said.
"Age of Empires II is a fun game. However, this remake is really nothing more than updating the game barely able to run on modern operating systems and resolutions. There is netplay via Steam now, but it's not very good. I've had better experience running the original game in a VM and playing via Hamachi. I honestly feel bad for supporting such a shoddy 'HD remake'"
"This game is timeless and clasic.  Its an rts that still holds strength years later, its graphics are the biggest turn off, but really the game play is 10/10 and the graphics wouldent be bad its just such an old game newer games look better in comparison. That said no new rts can match its gameplay, there is just something about the balance of this game and how it plays out that makes it one of the best rts games of all time."
i love this with my body.
After a long time I bought the game again to play it again. still having as much fun as I did when I had it 2000.
"♥♥♥♥ Microsoft, and ♥♥♥♥ this game. I can barely get a stable framerate on a game that came out ten years ago. GJ Microcock, you managed to make another piece of ♥♥♥♥."
"Best RTS game of it's time  but not for nowadays...   But k still enjoyable, but less than Age of Empires III ofcourse.  Graphic ? well i don't notice any worthed improvement in graphic :| FMV still the same not reworked.  Yes there are improvement, such as : Max population cap increased to 500 max, trading cards for creating badge, global achiements, some game mode, 5 new civilization.   But overall.... Not really good... only a little upgrade over here and there  Please rework the graphic, i don't think it is a HD :| "
"Still a nice RTS game with some negative points and some good points. First the HD edition sounds like High Definition resolution and Textures. So the HD resolution is available but not really HD Textures.  But with the great workshop support its no problem to find graphical updates.  It looks like the developer had not many work with that because some things that was bad in 1998 are still bad. Like the limited units selection. But it doesn't matter, it is still a great game and if you buy it you would have many fun with it. Above all by a really successful multiplayer experience. It's like the king of this game."
"After all these years, the English are STILL angry I destroyed their outpost.  ...who honestly builds outposts anyway?"
"Don't get this, it brings nothing new and breaks some of the old features it had.  You can't even discuss about this games flaws and features on Steam community since the section is made only for moderators to post. Sucks!"
best strategy game because cobra
Just buy this game already.
"Age of Empires II: HD is a strategy game remake developed by Skybox Labs, Hidden Path Entertainment, and Ensemble Studios, and published by Microsoft Studios. The remake was released in April 2013. The primary differences with the HD version is that the multiplayer component is on Steam servers and it features updated graphics and features. Firstly, the original Age of Empires II was my favourite strategy game when I was growing up. The aim of this was to recreate the success of the original, but this is a clear disappointment due to the infestation of bugs and glitches within it. This review will cover the campaign, the multiplayer, the gameplay and the issues within each category.  Age of Empires II: HD features a standard campaign. The campaign is split into nine separate event campaigns with several missions in each. The mechanics of the series, which is building up your city and completing the objectives, allow missions to prosper and reach a climax. Furthermore, the story continues nicely from one mission to the following one, allowing for a clear direction in each separate campaign. For instance, one campaign recounts Joan of Arc and her war against the British and logically and chronologically tells the story until the final mission. The single-player component allowed me revisit some old missions, experience some new missions, and for the most part amounted to an overall average campaign. It felt like an afterthought because it lacked excitement and lacked the edge for me to invest into each story, which I felt detracted from my overall experience. The only highlight of the single-player aspect was the ability to play without the issues that primarily infested multiplayer.  The original Age of Empires II's multiplayer was my favourite aspect of the game. The recreation of multiplayer in the HD version fail miserably. It is infested by numerous bugs and glitches that dampened my experience of it. The most notable issue in it was the desync issues, resulting in lag and unsmooth matches, for literally every match and while there are other bugs and glitches with multiplayer, that is by far the one that destroyed my experience of this. Furthermore, the developers have not actively supported this game in several months, but have released patches, so looking at the bright side, at least they have done some fixing to this game since its release. But, sometimes I was able to look past the issues and play online matches with teams and in doing so I noticed how much I suck at this game than I realised. Regardless, I wanted to have fun with this game because again I love this game but the issues destroy my play through and unfortunately, at this point in time I will not play this game until its fixed, if its fixed.  The gameplay however is classic Age of Empires. It features real-time strategy with workers, military, and buildings to improve your economy and your overall stability in a particular match. Traditionally you start in the dark ages and advance your civilisation to the imperial age in which each age grants you new units, buildings and technologies. The prominent positive of the gameplay is the uniqueness of each civilisation because each civilisation has a unique technology, unique unit and unique bonuses. Each civilisation has variety and I love that aspect because for instance, one nation could be a naval civilisation whereas another could be an infantry civilisation or a mixture of naval/archers, etc. Each nation's type of civilisation adds a strategic element of playing to your civilisations strengths and not how you typically play, which I love. And, overtime this game teaches you how to balance your economy because I admit I only build my economy and leave my units to the late-game, which by the late game I am already wiped out. So, I love the strategy aspect of balancing and building an economy and troops. There are numerous maps so the game does not become stale, but in Australia, there is barely more than three games in a lobby on most peak hour nights. A notable feature in this edition is the ability to have a population of 500, which as you know creates more performance issues, but not if you have a good computer.   I cannot comment on the expansions as I did not purchase them.  Lastly, Age of Empires II: HD is 'high definition', as implied in the name. There are not many new features to complement the title. The game features higher resolutions to accommodate modern computers. It features an integrated steam workshop, which does expand on the experience of the game, and the updated graphics that triumph over the base game. While there are not many new features, the ones that are new change the dynamic of the game.  Overall, Age of Empires II: HD is a disappointing game that has massive potential. I did want to enjoy this game because the original was my favourite in the series, but this comes off as a miss. It features a fairly standard campaign that has solid recounts of events in history and a good amount of missions, but it comes off as an afterthought. The game features a horrendous multiplayer experience because of the numerous issues within that component. But, it features the same brilliant gameplay that was in Age of Empires II. If the developers focus on fixing this game to improve the experience, I'm willing to revisit and re-edit this review to accommodate those potential changes. As things stand, I would avoid this game until the developers release patches that fix the issues, in particular the desync and lag issues.   Ratings: I calculate the point system by rating each component I discuss and then averaging the total and deducting marks depending on the amount and severity of issues within the game.  Campaign: 5/10 Multiplayer: 1/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Overall: 3/10  Thanks for reading my review!

It's a great game !
"It's good, I like it just as much as the original."
"Slash castles with swords until they catch fire, convert paladins to fight for your cause, use trebuchets to kill wolves, because that's how hardcore this game is. And don't forget, proffesionals use their sheep for scouting."

"I microwaved my dog because of how much I hate this game. I might've only played it for 0.2 hours, but I completed the campaign and I still don't know how to play the game. I played online and got bullied by 6 year olds, which sucks.  A+/62 Would buy again for myself.   i hate you"
"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Age of Empires has it all gathering, exploring, battles, conquering, building, and more. The tutorial is the best I have ever seen in any game in a long time. Once you get the hang of it you will not want to put it down. This game is highly addictive. I picked up part 3 in excellent condition at a resale shop and plan to play that one after I get my fix with this one. Two thumbs up."
"If you have alot of time, buy this. If you dont have alot of time, buy this."
"This game deserves the “I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD”!   Been playing AOE for over 15 years now :steamhappy:   You can learn it over a quick intro by either one of your friends or a quick tutorial, however it will take a lifetime to master. Even to this day some tactics my friends use can really surprise me. In my last epic game with 3 other friends I forged an alliance with friend Rex, cause of my years of experience I was a bit quicker with building an army then my friend Job so I spammed warelephants on him. He buckled under the pressure and went into hiding in the castle of the 3rd friend Mark. When I started to lay siege to his armies on the other side, my alliance member Rex however had other plans. He struck down my undefended base with an entire armada. The moment you realise all your friends are working against you makes you feel puny. My defeat was a fact and it was a glorious defeat.  Give this game a go if didn't play it yet, or pick it up again if you played the old skool SD version like me. And don't forget to vote! "
Killed 5000 enemy units + 10 cities with 30 Cobra cars. 99/10
"Same old Age of Empires you love, but no longer in Technicolor!"
what can i say? i love this game. when i first got my aoe game with windows 98 cd. it was demo but i played so many hours.   year is 2015 and i still play this game. i'm getting older but aeo isn't. everything is quite perfect with this game. game's best part is civ's balance.   every civ has different potantial and playing with them is quite fun.  Should i suggest this game? Kidding? Of course man!

"It's incredible how good this game still is today considering its age. On every aspects, be it strategy, features, graphics, campaigns, game modes, modding, ..."
"10/10 easily  One of my all time favourite RTS games alongside Total Annihilation. And as a game that's almost 18 years old, it's still getting updates and expansions to this day. With a fourth Expansion coming, after The Conquerers, The Forgotten, and The African Kingdoms respectively, and each Expansion is worth it.  The gameplay is very balanced between factions, and speaking of which there is a megaton of them and they're all different enough in their own way to give them a unique playstyle, such as the Huns to cavalry hordes or the Britons to Archer specialisation, and the Turks with Gunpowder technology. There is quite a lot of tactics and playstyles to be found.  The campaigns are fun but if you don't play them you're not missing much either. In saying that, multiplayer on this game is a bucketload of fun with a wealth of scenarios and map types to play on, all randomly generated as well.   From the soundtrack, to the balance, tactics, replayability and multiplayer, it's worth every cent."
"Thumbs up for the actual 'Age of Empires II' part, the 'HD' additions are questionable though, most new graphic assets seem worse than original and horribly low resolution."
"Top Game. This game really pushes you to your limits when playng aginst others, racing each other to certain ages, technologies and resources. What happens if you draw in this race you ask? Bloodshed, you send thousands of units in to war, defence using every last inch of your brain to try and outthink you opponent and find a loophole in their defences. This? is the ultimate think simulator!"
"AOE II sure is great fun and has amazing nostalgic value. But playing it with friends is almost impossible, desync after desync make it unplayable. We can barely finish a game because either at the start or like 20minutes ingame, we get desynced. They added the function to restore a desynced game but that rarely works...  It has been like this since they released the HD edition."
"The greatest damn game of the CENTURY, I play this with my buds 24/SEVEN 10/5 gr8 r8 m8 IGN SUPPORTED"
"Whoever decided to put region locks on this game, please remove the multiplayer and Steam gift region-lock. The first one broke the game for lots of people outside the US and EU and the second one damaged people's trust in your company (because what people like me paid for is not what they got). I paid for a region free 4-pack only to get them region-locked without notice months AFTER my purchase."
This Game is my life :/
"With the addition of the Steam Workshop and the ease of modding, getting AoE2 on steam is worth it as opposed to using the older version. The game is as it used to be and the HD remake is alright, though the texture mods are what make the game look much better.  Overall, worth getting it on steam."
Savage game. Sick one.
"I still can't belive that not only did I waste 20 bucks on a 15 year old game that I already owned, I CONVINCED ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS TO DO THE SAME THING.  WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥ IS WRONG WITH ME?"

The ultimate but still far from perfect edition of the best RTS game ever made. With every released patch situation is looking up however and AOE2HD will hopefully be free from impurities in the near future.

"Pick up a copy of Age of Empires II: HD and promptly fire up a multiplayer game, if you want to relive the old days and take a trip down memory lane. If you didn't play this game when it first came out back in 1999 though, you're unlikely to find anything interesting about this rework.   Ago of Empires II: HD features an entertaining mix of resource management and military combat, but many similar games that have been released since 1999 have better balanced gameplay, are better looking and likely cheaper as well.  Interestingly enough, the HD version features all the original low-resolution textures and sounds, so the 'HD' label is just refering to your monitor resolution (the original game being forced to an aspect ratio of 4:3). The game mechanics remain unchanged as well. So there's still lots of nostalgia there -- just not much more than that."
"Highly Recomend this game, graphics have a style that still holds up today gameplay is easy to learn hard to master. I suggest buying in a 4-pack with a few friends great fun, many maps, races, playstyles lots of replayability"
"Age of Empires is a good game that can keep you entertained for hours. It's also, $w4g."
"Spent over 6 hours playing a huge diplomacy world map with 7 other people, ended early in the morning when in the midst of a great battle my allies of 4 hours betrayed me for Gold and lulz. My army was crush and my kindom lay in ruins. 10/10 would be betrayed again"
"GET IT JACK, This game is fun online for any amount of friends. Even the campaign is suprisingly enjoyable. All round thumbs up."

It's a great game !
Absolutly one of the best strategy games of all time. There are some Hickups but its a great game.
BEST CRAZY GAME EVER!!! 5/7
its good but i cannot queue orders. you added new AI in this but didnt even bother to add a basic RTS function?  ill stick to rise of nations (better game)
"Age of Empires II is a fine real time strategy game. The campaigns are fun, and the multi player has a high skill ceiling and its own unique style not found in other RTS games.  But this version is unplayable for me, and many others. More than half of my games end in a freeze in to disconnect. I recommend to just play the original Age of Empires 2, or The Forgotten Empires, on Voobly.  (www.voobly.com) .  It's a shame, because a new expansion pack, after more than 10 years, was made for Age of Empires II HD - The African Kingdoms - adding new civilizations and campaigns. That's pretty hype. It made me come back to this game that I hadn't played for years. But the disconnections and freezes are making me quit."
"A true classic. The visuals are still up looking good, the playability is top notch.  I love both the campaign and multiplayer. IT's still awesome."
"A classic, this was my first pc game years and years ago. Glad they revived it with the HD graphics, well worth the 20 bucks."
The Classic for good reasons no doubts. Worth it every way. *other Versions are as much played for balance issues that new civs/units bring as well for better stability and stablished advanced strategies.
The game doesn't start after the new update!!
Amazing game for when it came out but the 'remaster' is shamefully bad. The worst of it are the reolution issues where if your screen is on 1080p the text and view options are too tiny to even click. Might as well buy the old disk version
"Played it for so many years growing up, just as great as I remember."
its good but i cannot queue orders. you added new AI in this but didnt even bother to add a basic RTS function?  ill stick to rise of nations (better game)
"Get all population on wood and/ or food. Make massive farms in grid around grain store. Build walls. Level up. Build castle. Generate 12 trebuchets. Generate a few dozen soldiers and 40 arbalasts to guard trebuchets. Go on rampage.  10/10 - would mercilessly crush all other civilisations again, even after they surrender. Mwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
"This game is something really amazing. It has changed my life, my way of thinking, and my strategic thinking processes. I am the king among my fellows at this game; a title well deserved. If their reading this, my luck my run out."
"I have played AoE since the very start. Every expansion, every civ. When I recently found out they had released AoE 2 HD and The Forgotten expansion I was stoked. AoE 2: The Conquerors had been my favorite strategy game of all time. All those dark ages civs and the historically accurate technologies plus the unique units each possessed are an absolute genius of game development, at least for history buffs such as I. I love everything about this game. Especially the new civilizations added in The Forgotten. The few glitches and bugs have been tamed a bit from the original release and the graphics are more crisp and the water keeps you thinking the sun is really hitting it mid day. All in all its the same game as before, just tweaked and cleaned up. If there were stars to give, I would give this one a definite 5 star rating."
"A classic, this was my first pc game years and years ago. Glad they revived it with the HD graphics, well worth the 20 bucks."
It's a Fair game but I found Fairer games than this one though
A great RTS to play with some friends.
I've been playing this game a bit. It's pretty cool.
"Great game.  If you played the game with your friends when you where young, then just get your friends to buy this game too and relive those days."
A great game from the childhood.
Great game. 10/10
"I would really recomend this game, since , atleast for me, it was one of my favourite childhood games.  10/10"
"nice remake of a nice game, love it!"
"Great game, HD makes a massive difference for all age of empire fans."
"Just like the old AoE, but prettier!"
Made everyone allys and Built a huge army to turn against them and annihilate..  Ended up with 2 giant armys on my ♥♥♥  10/10  played original Version years back hd remake is impressive
"I can't even begin to say how much I have loved this game as a child back when my dad gave me his collection of old games (which included AOE, AOE 2, the origional Warcraft 1 and 2 and the origional C&amp;C games. I slamed the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game when I started at the age of 5 and one every game that I ever played (still hold that record to date).   This game was, and still is, a gem in stratigic gameplay. Granted, most would find that this game doesn't have good textures, but to those who grew up in the pre-cons. gaming era, this is one of the few games that still holds its popularity. With its new Civs that were added we get an even bigger sample of gameplay than ever before.   Playing this game for over a decade, I have never found this game dull or boring in the slightest. In fact, I have enjoyed any game of the AO series (AOE or AOM).   Battling on both land and sea, this game can get really fun to play. This game can get you on the edge of your seat when they surround your stronghold and a battle is ongoing for what feels like hours, and yet you somehow work it all out and push out and win the game.  Sometimes, you even get lucky enough to the point where the AI spares you just one worker and you build back up to win the game (thats what I did once in a game).   "

"Get the 4 pack, send them to friends, and play this incredibly fun game."
This game is a classic and with the new HD it brings back hours of fun from my earlier years.
This Game is my life :/
"Whoever decided to put region locks on this game, please remove the multiplayer and Steam gift region-lock. The first one broke the game for lots of people outside the US and EU and the second one damaged people's trust in your company (because what people like me paid for is not what they got). I paid for a region free 4-pack only to get them region-locked without notice months AFTER my purchase."
this is a great game that brings back so many mermories
"Great game.  If you played the game with your friends when you where young, then just get your friends to buy this game too and relive those days."
How do you turn this on
"Great purchase! I used to LAN with this game in College, and it still entertains me today! I don't notice the graphics being very different, but it is still much better in several ways. For instance, no AGE2 lan would be official if we hadn't already spent 3 hours trying to get everyone's computer to run this properly. We would run into firewall issues, lack of the 'c patch' then not everyone had explorers, and EVERYONE lost their disc, so we'd have to pass around the one copy that someone hadn't lost, or just run to walmart and buy it for the 6th week in a row. After we lost at least 1 person to frustration, and the teams became uneven again, we would be ready to game! *This is all gone, you hop on, search for you friends games on the steam network, then you start. Honestly it's a little surreal. Anywho, great game, worth every penny."
"I have been playing this gave for about 20 years now. I love it, this remake it great and does the original justice very well. A lot of cool improvements can be found in the workshop as well."
"Age of Empires II is a fine real time strategy game. The campaigns are fun, and the multi player has a high skill ceiling and its own unique style not found in other RTS games.  But this version is unplayable for me, and many others. More than half of my games end in a freeze in to disconnect. I recommend to just play the original Age of Empires 2, or The Forgotten Empires, on Voobly.  (www.voobly.com) .  It's a shame, because a new expansion pack, after more than 10 years, was made for Age of Empires II HD - The African Kingdoms - adding new civilizations and campaigns. That's pretty hype. It made me come back to this game that I hadn't played for years. But the disconnections and freezes are making me quit."
"I love this game and I've played it for years. But the Steam's HD version has lot of multiplayer desync problems. I've had problems in my last 5-10 multiplayer games. I hoped the last update (DEC 2016) could fix these problems, but still here. That's the reason of my vote."
"In my opinion, those 200+hours are well spent"
live the dream clotted cream.
After 2015 November this game got ruined.. and you see the Hours what I have put on this game so I have been playing this before it but not anymore.
"Was really excited to get this game, hoping to relight some great memories with fantastic new factions, maps and AI. Unfortunately the once award-winning game has been resurrected riddled with problems. Simple things like terrible maps that often don't outright work, and frame rate issues that make the game simply unplayable (often coming to a complete stand-still later in the game). Any good additions like new techs and civilisations are dwarfed by such game-breaking issues.  My advice? Don't get this game. Go get the original and don't have one of your favourite games ruined by simple money grabbing."
"You can't even do LAN games with the HD version. The only good thing about this is the resolution fix, but the rest of it is uneccecary and would be traded in any time for LAN functionality."
"Multiplayer is beyond broken, good luck trying to restore a game if one of the players' internet drops. Just wasted 3 hours of game only to have it ruined when trying to restore the game. Apart from the bugs and glitches with muliplayer AOE2 is one of the best RTS games ever made and it sucks to have to leave it a bad review but the multiplayer is BROKEN."
"Don't buy, till they fix it."
"Buggy as hell. Between me and the three other players I play with we average a half hour or more of game troubleshooting every other time we try to play together. Getting to the point where the game isn't worth it anymore. Always a new error code, or just random crashing without any changes being done on our end. Wasn't a problem a few years ago, but not it's almost constant."
"I can NOT reccommend buying AOE ll HD even though it is the best strategy game available. It is great for single player and multiplayer alike and has enless variations. The reaseon you should NOT currently buy it, is because Microsoft have licensed it soley through Valve/Steam who require you to play it through their online system which is a total problem. Playing games that require Valve/Steam means that your PC has to update all of their marketing info almost daily, so if you dont turn it on for a week you cant get anyware till you have downloaded a week's worth of their updates, mostly for Junk mail presentations they want to push on to you. But thats not the real problem. The real problem with Valve/Steam is that you mostly can't get access because their system is overloaded or rubbish or both. This has been the same for years. Their support community is full of customer problems that have not been responded to by Steam. I mainly want to play AOE by myself when I get time and should be able to expect a game I have paid for to give me that. But all I get is connection problems and 9 times out of 10 when I want to play it over recent years , it doesnt work. AOE = Great , Steam = Pathetic. If Microsoft would sell me a new copy on my own PC, I would gladly pay ten times the current price just to get away from Steam"
This is just another attempt to squeeze money from a dead series. The title 'HD' is a joke cause its the same scaled up textures also it doesn't offer any new gameplay featuresat all. We quickly stopped playing it because of the serious performance issues it has. By that i mean constant desync and lag problems during multiplayer gaming.
Could not adjust resolution! Had to play in a sort of 'zoomed in' mode. I got refunded by Steam luckily.
Matchmaking got removed for fixing purposes... like 6 months ago...
This game was fun when it came out orginally and the hd redo was fun for a while too but now they require you to download more dlc to play the full game you already had. ♥♥♥♥ THAT.
"Hello fellow Age of Empires Fans.  Many of you might consider buying this AOE 2 HD Version because the original was so much fun to play back in the good old days (I used to play it with my father on Windows 98 on LAN ^^) and this one seems to offer many enhancements!  Let me list a few of them: - The Population-Limit is rasied to 500 per player. Yes. Insane! :D  - Water looks way way more like water, they added a 3d rendering option. (So you can switch it off too)  - In the 'Forgotten Empires' Expansion which is new to this game, you can play more (lacking a better word) 'modern' Empires, such as India, Hungary, etc.  - Many new map types were added, and the option to size the map EPIC. Which it really becomes! Your scouts take 10 minutes to go a whole round. (At least mine do).  - Various little improvements to the User Interface (UI). You can now select more units with one selection (which comes in quite handy with the 500 Population Limit)  - Military units can now 'invade' a location. Sending them to a spot on the map with that command, they will attack anybody on their way.  - You can now ultra fast forward (to save time in single player, i don't reccomend it for multiplayer, though it is possible)  And a few more I forgot to mention or even don't know of yet.  All in all, 'Microsoft Studios' set themself a really low goal in adding tiny features like the ability to select a few more units at a time, and changing a number '200' to '500' for the Population Limit (which a mod that was made for AOE 2 already did.)   So now you may ask me, 'why do you NOT recommend the game?'.  Well the answer is simple. The masterminds at 'Microsoft Studios' broke the game.  By that i mean, it's unplayable if you don't own a brandnew last generation high end PC that can play Crisis 3, Battlefield 4, and all those games at Ultra Graphics.  I have, like many of you, a 2 year old configuration:  CPU: AMD FX 4100, Quad-Core, downclocked to 3 GHz GPU: AMD HD Radeon 6970, 2GB GDDR5 RAM RAM: 8 GB, CL7  The other parts to not influent the raw game performance. My OS is Windows Vista Ultimate 64bit.  After you read this, you might think: 'Ok, so you can run the game 4 times parallel of course.' Well, no i can't. And the majority around the world can't either.  ===  Here is the problem why:  After like 5 minutes into the game, when i've built maybe..5 houses, the game gets a seizure and drops the framerate to about 10-5. Additionally, every 1 or 2 seconds, the game halts for another second, like someone hits the pause button every second. (Which of course nobody does, it occurs in bth Singleplayer and Multiplayer.  I did experiment with that, too look what is causing it. The more units are present on the map, you know because logically every players empire grows in the first 10 minutes, the more it lags permanently.  On the other hand, the more units are 'on screen' like when one of my friends sends me an army of 100 Knights or other stuff, the more it lags proportionally to the number of units present on screen.  ===  What did help temporarily, was to turn the screen resolution (which you strangely can not do in the game's settings anymore) down to 1024x 768. With that, it runs at 30 FPS, which seems to be the max for the game (i guess because it's 2d, but i'm not sure about that.  Many of you might know what this resolution looks like ingame. You can see your Towncenter but nothing else, because of the small resolution. And that is, of course, unplayable. Raising the resolution to 1280x720 (which is JUST A TINY BIT more pixels difference if you do your math.) makes the game drop it's FPS to 15 again.  Dont even think of Full HD (which is 1920x1080), that is my native resolution.   It doesn't solve the problem too, because you can still feel the 1 second intervall lag when scrolling and when units move.   So what did I try next, I set the game's executable to run only on 1-2 cores of my CPU, because lots of older games have difficulties adjusting the game's clock to the CPU clock speed because its so much higher than the game was designed for.  Didn't help. Downgrading GPU Drivers. Didn't help. Running the original AOE 2. No problems at all.  ===  If you remember, i said something about brandnew high end PC earlier in this text. (Sorry it is so long, but i want as many players as possible to read it so they don't waste their 20$, or 30$ if you add the 'Forgotten' expansion pack.)  What i meant by that is, a friend of mine owns a brandnew (a few months ago) elite gaming notebook, that has all the newest CPU and GPU to that point.  He can run Battlefielfd 4 at Ultra smoothly. And even on his machine the lag of this AOE 2 HD game is noticable. It doesnt drop the FPS, but every second you can see the stuttering. For him it doesnt affect the gameplay like it does for me.   You can read throughout the internet (and here on Steam) of this 'massive lag' problem. And no-one knows any solution to it.  Today is the 26th of April. I saw right now that on 24th of April there was an update to the game. But in the changelog they only mentioned adding a few campaigns (which of course is  so  important) and minor fixes of displaying bugs in leaderboards in multiplayer.  I'm going to check it out now, if somehow magically it suddenly works.  But it won't. I know it.  If you don't believe me, google it.  Make sure you know what you are talking about before you comment.    I hope you found my article to be useful, and you will not give your good money to 'Microsoft Studios' anytime soon. Thank you.  You are welcome to contact me to discuss this review, or bring any attempts on solutions for the broken game.  - Sgt Cold."
"Anyone with an high-res screen simply *CAN'T* play this game. Whether you change the resolution of your display (4K to 720p in my case) or switch to another lower-res screen (4:3 720p screen), the game stays in 4K resolution, and everything is extremely small. I'm sure a small map could fit in a single screen. This problem has been around since the beginning, and is still not fixed. Other than that the game is very good."
slowest support ticket response ever. having a lot of troubles about game start up. just check some forums before buying it. It still doesnt work on my new pc. I wish I didnt buy it
"I loved this game.This is an old game which we played a lot of nights (LAN) and hatd so much fun with.  Its still good for single player campaign.  The big Problem is the multiplayer: No LAN, and per steam it crashes. Very frustrating  An other Problem is, that it lags even when you play single mode with lots of units and KI.  The new content and the graphic do not justify the price because the heart of this game (multiplayer) is not working.  Its 2016, the game is 17 years old and they cant get it run smoothly without crashing.  Dear developers, do first your basic homework for the lots of profit you make with this game. I dont care about a new design as long as you cant get the normal game run smoothly!"
"While I thoroughly enjoy this game and love playing it with friends, the networking code is absolutely atrocious and is complete garbage. It makes it almost impossible to play with other people, especially if you add AI to the game. The new map size, Ludicrous, is absolutely unplayable online. It would be much faster to gouge your eyes out with a paperclip out of pure frustration than to wait for the game to register that you clicked a unit and gave it orders."
Nothing HD about this.  Age of Empires was an amzing game when it came out. THIS IS NOT THE SAME GAME.  This rerelease does little. I can't tell the difference with these 'HD' graphics.  Why are asshats downvoting this review?  Multiplayer is broken with sync issues.  I get 18-25 FPS on multiplayer on a 980TI. Basically a broken game with MP.  Forget about resuming a saved game between friends because once you jump back in it desync and kicks you out.  YOU CANNOT RESUME A SAVED GAME WITH MULTIPLAYER. PERIOD. '   Edit: why are you meatheads downvoting a game that desyncs and cannot resume multiplayer games?
I love it since its release &lt;3
"AOE2 is a great game, and is my all time favorite RTS. However the netcode in the steam version is terrible, I can't play a game with 2 other friends and 5 bots without the game lagging like hell. It usually starts ok, but as the game progresses it becomes literally unplayable. The non steam version has a mod called UserPatch which you can play online with 8 players and absolutley no lag what so ever. I don't know what UserPatch does that the steam version doesn't but I know I'll never try to play online with the steam version again."
now i own this game twice
I suck. But I play with some people who are pretty good. 10/10
Plenty of H. Needs more D. 2/10
"Gameplay: Good Historical accuracy: Horrible  Saladin was evil, not good.  Know your stuff.  Khan Tervel saved Europe from the Islamic hordes."
"The game is good But the multiplayer is the worse I ever saw... There are only toxic players in the community. Moreover, the Elo systems ( Ranking System) does not work correctly you are always being injured by kiters or out sync problems losing precious points. I really recommend you to not buy this game. If you want a MMORTS game there are better ones in the market with better communities and better multplayers systems. Buy this age 2 HD is just going to stress you out in multiplayers matches."
"If you've never heard of Age of Empires II, this is probably not for you. If you're a long time fan and player, this is for you, but you're probably better off sticking to the original.  I must have just turned 9 years old when I spent my entire allowance on a 2 CDROM box of AoE II Gold edition. I still have the box and the discs and every now and then I return to this game I grew up with. It felt only right that I should get a renewed version that wouldn't rely on a dedicated user base to fix things like resolution problems and low population caps. In fact, I'm pretty sure this entire product floats on the nostalgia of players like myself.  Overall though, I must say I am disappointed. Of course, the game itself is still fantastic and I dare say timeless. However, it seems that everything that was done to rebrand it as HD Edition has been to the game's detriment. It is far buggier than before, performs far worse than before (and no, it is not my pc) and new additions, from interface to units, are executed in a sloppy / rushed manner. Whoever worked on this can't possibly have been a fan of the game, as they did it a great injustice by treating it so carelessly.  In the end, there is just no way to justify the price this is going for on Steam and I sure am glad I got it on sale at the time."
"AoE II is a great game indeed, but HD? What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version, I feel robed, the game doesn't even look like the screenshots! It's the biggest waste of my money ever, I should keep my good old memories of the original one"
"Even after more than 2 years (!!!), Age II HD is still a buggy mess. Slowdowns, freezes, disconnects and more. The Forgotten campaigns are poorly designed and there are no voiceovers. The lobby is from the middle ages and there are no dedicated servers or something like a host migration system. It feels like Micro$oft didn't put any love or finetuning into this remastered version.  An absolute terrible shame for this strategy pearl and for everybody who played and loved the original Age of Empires 2."
"I think positive reviews are due to the original age of empires 2 game. This HD version on the other hand barely improves on the graphics. ( Yeah, water looks better as if anyone cared about that..) The population limit is increased, but the game starts lagging long before the population limit is reached because of engine limitations.   As expected from a cash-grab company instead of fixing the issues with the game, they spent time to release an expansion with new single player campaigns, when the popularity of the original was due to the multiplayer experience. I don't know if they fixed the issues, or will ever fix them, but I gave the game enough chances and now gave up on it.  Edit: Now buying the game and the two expansions costs less than only buying the two expansions. What a nice ♥♥♥♥ you to people who only have the game from M$."
"very bad game, totaly wasting your time... and also sometimes out of sync occured , sync problems, game is totaly too old to play.."
"AoE2 is great, but this HD edition is broken. There's no good reason for it to have such a terrible framerate on an AMD X2 5000+ dual core processor and GeForce 7900GS graphics card. Just the main menu itself uses half the processor. No, I don't have this problem with any other games."
"AoE II is a great game indeed, but HD? What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version, I feel robed, the game doesn't even look like the screenshots! It's the biggest waste of my money ever, I should keep my good old memories of the original one"
"The devs don't know what they are doing, after the game got patched, all my saves are now unusable.  Buy the original version, it's a great game, but don't go for this 'HD' version."
"The game is good But the multiplayer is the worse I ever saw... There are only toxic players in the community.

"Multiplayer restore doesn't work and hasn't worked for the past 6 months. Supposedly they are planning on fixing it with a patch, but where is the patch?"
pretty fun and stuff...
This game is pretty dank and every memeworthy person aughta play this. WOLOLO
WHAT? YOU DON'T OWN THIS GAME? WHAT IT'S NOT ON SALE? WHO GIVES A ♥♥♥♥ BUY 50 COPYS!
I bought it and my dad and I spent over 300 hours on it and now it wont even work!All it says is 'Steam servers too buzy to update Age of Empires II HD' :(
"Multiplayer still broken above 3 players... Lag, frame drops..... It's been a year and this is still an issue... Wish I could refund."
"The multiplayer is still really laggy, do not bother buying."

"It was 2001, I had just played my 10000th game of Age of Empires 1. I later discovered in a shelf of games 'Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings'. I was intrigued, installed it, and booted it up. While being able to queue units for my first time in a strategy game was a novel concept, I did not like the game at all. I continued to play games like Rise of Nations, Command and Conquer: Generals, and Age of Empires 1 until Age of Empires 3 came out. I enjoyed it.  Here we are, 15 years after my initial discovery. Somehow, out of complete nowhere, I now enjoy Age of Empires 2 more than almost any other real time strategy game I've ever played in my entire life.  If this isn't proof of aliens having mind control rays trying to send us back into the dark ages of medieval society so we're easier to take over, I don't know what is."
"The most memoriable game I ever played beside Half-Life, from my childhood. Its a shame that The Forgotten Empires is used to be a free mod and now its a dlc for money..."
" KAMGUSTA's mini Review   Some games should remain only in our memories. Graphic is not HD at all. Gameplay is almost 20 years old. It was a classic back in its days, but I see no point in playing it nowadays.   Score 5/10 "
"Can't go wrong with this HD remake - a clearly the same old with tons of improvements. It is true that at release date there were bunch of errors/bugs, I couldn't stand playing it as it was lagging like hell even on my rather decent system. But to date, many if not all have been fixed so it's ok.  Gameplay is the same as the older version, graphic is slightly different due to enhancements for modern systems but it's a welcome change nonetheless. And no no no, even with 2000 graphic I won't call this outdated, the graphic is just perfect for the game.  Game balance, again, isn't changed for this release. I am not a pro AoE player so can't say much, but each civs will have their own strong points to counter other civs. You also will need to learn each units' weakness and power before you go on war, need to scout often to know the enemy's position, and to build a good defense and provisions. Thus, as Sun Tzu said, know yourself and your enemy, and you'll win a thousand battles. So much elements in a single game.  Multiplayer is this game's strong point, but also the weakest. If you find hosts/peers with bad connections most likely you won't find the experience good. Also there's a tendency that multiplayer games die fast - and as such is afflicting this game too. There's a reason for four pack on Steam though. Grab the pack and play with your friends.  And play the Skirmish/Single player before you go against real opponent. Learning curve is kinda steep tho, so don't get frustrated.  Overall, a great game. And also it's on sale often - grab it when you can."
"Bought this gaming hoping it would be like Dawn of the Modern World or like Age of Empires 3. Not at all what I was hoping. The main reasons why I say that, is the graphics are terrible, everything looks so flat, theres no 3D look to it. The movement of the soliders and what not, is so bad. Granted, this game came out long ago, but since this is HD edition you would have thought it would be better. I would love to recommend this game, but I can't. This review isn't coming from someone who's just played AoE once and hated it. It's coming from someone whos had many hours in many AoE games and loved the games so much. Like I said, I wish I could recommend this, but I just can't."
"Honestly, the lamest remake ever. Developers are just stupid and don't even know how to fix the lag. Do no buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Use Garena instead."
"The 'expansions' are terribly designed with my units getting stuck in rocks, worse programming than before. I've tried the same mission multiple times with 'random' things happening and finally being able to finish a mission by sheer luck. Wow, all I can say."
"this would be good if it wasn't for priests; the most OP unit in the entire game, shouting WOLOLO at all my men and turning them against me.   i have never hated religion more in my life than in this moment, when i am euphoric, freed from the shackles of the devious cult of WOLOLO and its followers"
"A great Strategy game, if you like strategy games you really want this game. Multiplayer is peer to peer (P2P), which means the more people playing the better internet connection everybody needs, if just one has a slow internet connection everybody will lag since they will be forced to wait for him."
Wolololololololololo  There. Now you want to buy this game. It's Age of Empires II. It might be the single greatest RTS ever made.
I recommend this game. It's not as gay as I thought!
"this would be good if it wasn't for priests; the most OP unit in the entire game, shouting WOLOLO at all my men and turning them against me.   i have never hated religion more in my life than in this moment, when i am euphoric, freed from the shackles of the devious cult of WOLOLO and its followers"
"I grew up playing Age of Empires 2. The HD rerelease is the same game but with dozens of game braking bugs. The most glaring one for me being that the Huns racial bonus simply doesn't regester. When normally they start at max avilable population and don't need (and indeed can't even build) houses, my game now starts them at 5 population and makes houses available to build. So we can add non-existant game mechanics to the laundry list of issues presented for this game on the community support pages. Most disturbing of all is that this bug didn't develope until after I had played several games and now won't seem to go away.   Also, HD? Come on, the game still looks like a colored pencil sketch on graph paper. Don't get me wrong, I'll never hold that against it. AoE2 is a cornerstone of the RTS genre and I love it, but the fact that it's HD might be part of the issue. it seems more and more these HD rereleases come with glaring bugs and glitches not present in the origionals. Currently I can't even play this game, let alone recomend it, until these isues are fixed."
Great game for replicating the same jokes everyone makes when playing Settlers of Catan.
"I remember playing this game when I was 11, such a good game, I love it so much. To anyone reading to see if this game is good, DO IT 100% DO IT, you won't regret it ;) The game is good is what im saying haha."
"When this game first came out, everybody was very excited until they region-locked multiplayer and Steam gifts in people's inventories. Whoever decided to do that, please next time lock it before it is released so that people know what they are buying. If you are not confident about your games' sales (as unlike the developers/publishers of Civ5, CS GO and Europa Universalis 4 - to mention a few examples of people who did not lock their games), then at least follow the example of XCOM Enemy Unknown and lock your game and DLC from the first day they are released rather than tricking people and haphazardly adding the region-lock note on their store page and then forgetting to write in the locked Steam gifts what regions they are locked to."
"Thanks. Broke the entire game with the update. can't even open it anymore. Just shows microsoft logo, pops up debugger and crashes. Thanks again for working hard on something I can no longer play."
Too many multiplayer issues to justify the price. You cannot play this over LAN! I can barely stand to play online because of the huge lag hiccups every 10 seconds. AVOID! Instead just mod the classic with HD textures and resolution tweaks.
Still one of the best strategy games!
"burned down a farm by hitting it with swords and took down a stone castle with bows 10/10  on a more serious note, a must if you find it on sale, a bit overpriced otherwise"
"Why not? It is a classic, it is fun. Woo lo lo lo."
Great game best of all the age of empires
This game in a nutshell is basically listening to banjo music and wanting to cut yourself. 11/10 IGN

The game is good but I can't recommend it because of the r3tarded community that always lies that they are new players and join the 'new players only lobby' and just crush you therefore never being able to learn the game.  1/10 don't buy this ever

best game ever i would love to have it but i don't have any money i played this game by my friend sharing it with me
impossible to play on a high resolution screen. unable to read text or see icons.
One of the best old school games ever made. Strategy is awesome and back stabbing your friends who are allies never gets old!
"I would say it it is not prepared as good at it could be. Right, the HD edition solves graphics glitches that occurs occasionally in standard edition, but it has huge problems to work smoothly on my Core 2 Duo. I think this game doesn't use GPU at all (one CPU core is under heavy load all the time though). All in all after reaching about 100 units on the map (limit is 500 per player) the framerate drops to something like 0.5FPS. Maybe it works better on modern CPUs but on my old machine it's terrible experience. I didnt expect that."
"Buggy laggy game, not really 'remastered'"
"Age of Empires II is a great addition to any classic-lover's library. It depicts very nice the way games were played one decade ago. For me the game is very familiar becuase it represented my first incursion in PC gaming, and that's why i love it and i can recommend it to anyone."

well performed HD-Version of the classic strategy Game Age of Empires II

"Yeah it was okay. I couldn't make any super soldiers or summon aliens, so it wasn't accurate for its time. 6/10 maybe buy it again, thanks Bible."
"Got an A+ on my history test, besides pretty smoth RTS on the market the campaings alone are worth it."
"At first I didn't notice what was so 'HD' about this version of the game, but after playing for a bit i realised. This game is one of my childhood games, suprisingly so much easier now (whodathunkit?). Only think I don't like is the new images for food and wood stockpiles, as well as the fire animation; it doesn't match the overall look of the game tbh. But yeah this game is amazing, recommend 100%."
"Good game, nice cars, good simulator with hot babes."
Developed by a branch of the History Channel this game tells the tale of many great empires. Its as if they were really there. The stories contained here are almost akin to fantasy novels but they actually happened. That is what makes it so mystifying. Humanity really did rely on 13 villagers hitting stones. Simple things like that might make you realize how far we have come as humans. I'll always remember the chapter where the Saracens ran out of sheep. Such famine proves that as a species we can overcome any obstacle.
"I have played only a handful of RTS games, and this was pretty much my first 'real' RTS game. Easy to pick up and play but difficult to master, and very fun with friends."
"Age of Empires 2... I first picked this game up in 2005 when i was 7 years old. I bought the game as a cd along with age of empires 1 and Rise of Rome Expansion. I started with AoE and played it for a couple months straight, learning every units strngths and weaknessed and figuring out strategies. I quickly became a master and decided i had beaten the game. I then open my copy of AoE 2 and play it for the year or so. I played the game so much my parents would have to take the game and hide it from me. Sadly one of the times they hid it, I never found it again.  Enter 2014, I find this game on sale one day and instantly buy it. I didnt even notice anything about The Forgotten Exansion. The game is exactly like it used to be with some changes with the new material. The only exection, i now have a gaming console that allows me to play other people and my friends.   The game has many things that make it great that you can read about in other reviews.  The only prolem i have is the path finding is so awful in this game, but its definately a step up from AoE where they didnt even form troop formations. The path finding can be so frustrating especially in multiplayer, you have to have amazing micro skills. This takes ALOT of practice.  Graphics: 5/10 its a 90's game remade Gameplay: 9/10 tons of replay value, different map each time with different enemies and different tactics PathFinding: .001/10 its not that bad it just is really annoying sometimes Music: addictive, youll be humming along after your first 10 minutes  "
"What the hell is wrong with this game on steam?? I was saving a scenario that i just made, and the game just crashed, i have spent 2 hours to create that new scenario, what is wrong with steam?? i want my two hours back, i have wasted two hours because something wrong with age of empires 2 on steam."
"The lag is unbelievably bad for multiplayer, which is the reason most of us got the Steam version, there are way, way better alternatives like Voobly to play this in multiplayer and you don't waste money on this broken game. Don't buy this if you ever think of playing online on Steam."
A CLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASIC  19/10 above average.
5/5 Buy the damn thing. It is on sale.
A timeless classic. Super fun strategy (real-time) game with hours of gameplay to be had.
Was a great blast from the past much enjoyed it :)
"What to say about a clasic of real time strategy, it's awesome. You have a couple of civilizations to choose and a several campaigns.  Too many options to play in only a few days. You can spend a lot of time in this game and it still being awesome."
Just buy it
"I have played only a handful of RTS games, and this was pretty much my first 'real' RTS game. Easy to pick up and play but difficult to master, and very fun with friends."
"Hey People,  If you played this game when you were young and you enjoyed it, then it's a must buy game for you. The HD version simplified the hotkeys in a way that even I, a noob who's terrible at stategie games can work this game using hotkeys. Also the Graphics in HD and people enhancing stuff from the workshop is definitely a big plus aswell!  Now if you have never played this game before the HD release because of whatever reason you missed it in it's glory time and you think what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking game is this? I would advice you to look past the graphics on this one game, because i truly believe that this is one of the best RTS games ever made and one of the best which is still played online. Truly allot of old school RTS games have seen their end, but this one is still going strong and it was released in 1998! 16 years ago!  The only downside in this game is that the engine which runs the game can't handle the pop limit people like to play in. People love to play at 300 population limit and if you are playing a 4v4 game, get ready get your socks lagged off. cause the game always has that one guy who still plays on that 16 year old pc which they originally played it on back in the day. But even when you have no laggers the engine can't move ALL units simultaneously in a 4v4 with 300 pop. Which makes stationary units like onagers, Archers (Especially the Brits longbowmen) Scorpians and Bombard Towers slightly overpowered because they dont have to move in order to shoot! A 3v3 is do-able if the game doesn't go SUPER late.  But i concider this only a minor flaw in a further perfect game.  10/10"

"I purchased the cheapest option here, after I installed the game, it was not in HD at all. I thought that this would be in HD?"
The remake is pretty good but I wish we would see an Age of Empires 2 with a new game engine (instead of AoE Online which was a joke).
It's like building an Empire in multiple Ages twice!!!

Wow! High school nostalgia. Dope game.
Woah Age of empires 2 the game of my childhood. This game is one of the best rts games on the market it's fun and games last a perfect time not to long not to short. Age of empires 2 this game goes from medieval to gunpowder . From knight rush to bombard cannon spam . I highly suggest this game to any rts fan or any medieval fan also the dlc are highly suggested although you will probably use African kingdoms over the forgotten they are both still good and bring some sexy kingdoms to the game like the Portuguese fielding their organ guns and the Ethiopians with the mighty shotel warrior cheap faster then a horse and can be spammed to Tim buck too . If you have no life like me you can sink hours into this game I've got 60 hours in 3 days in this game alone . It's cheap it's fun 10/10
"Obviously shows it's age, but it's still one of the best games I've ever played. Out of what are in my opinion the three best RTS games ever made (Warcraft II, AoE II, and Rise of Nations) this one stays fresh the longest. To add to that, the multiplayer almost never gets old, as every nation, every map, and every gamemode makes for a unique experience time and time again."
"Holy crap, this was an awesome game years ago, all you had to do was not ruin it. But you did. Nice job Steam. Save your money, play the original."
I dont even have to say anything because as soon as you visit the store page you'll buy the game. even if you don't want the game you will still buy it.
How do you turn this on?
""
I love this game. I mean.. I LOVE this game.. This is a classic in every sense.
Game goes out of Sync a lot. Can't restore Multiplayer saves. All multiplayer saves are out of sync.
"Shouldnt have to explain why this is the best rts of all time. If you've played it you understand, if you havn't get around to playing it if you downvote it it is because you have bad taste."
Pure nostalgia &lt;3 Still one of the best AoE games :)
"Classic AoE2 was already perfect and therefore only few changes were needed to bring this title to 2k10's standards, namely the higher resolution.  My only gripe is the price tag. 20 bucks for a remastered classic? Seriously? That's milking a cow already milked to death years ago."
It's fun. Play it. Or don't. I'm not your boss.
great game but i wish they addaed all of age empires one to it as a exspansion from nomad to full city
This is one of those classic games that you should play with your friends. It's a must buy game.
"Similar to Stronghold Crusader, this game is one of the most facinating and historical competitive games I have ever played. It features many different civilizations such as the Turks, Aztecs and Spanish along with new DLC's compared to the original Microsoft version. This also has a high variety of strategies and gameplay features and with a new steam workshop and Server Lobby. To bring this story short, I reccomend this game to anyone who is into Old timey Medieval Strategy games."

"I consider myself a menace at RTS games. But playing amongst friends far better at microing then myself is definitely increased my skill. It is also a refreshing difference from the endless catalog of FPS games of which i am accustomed to and am ahead of the casual gamer curve (heh). If anyone was to ever be bored enough to read this review i would recommend this game. You know what you are going to get, its not the most difficult RTS to learn (it's probably the easiest), and is a lot of fun. Having said this, buy it with friends. This games enjoyment is found with others and online is difficult for the noob."

ohh the memories ...thank u microsoft for so much mun
i was going to write a bad review but microsoft had monk and went wolololo
"I LOVE AOE2! Really takes me back to the good ol' days. Although, desynching and missing/not functional features such as loading saved online games and a good spectator overlay. I still love playing AoE2 though. Thouroughly enjoyed all 262 hours I've played so far. 8.5/10 :)"
ohh the memories ...thank u microsoft for so much mun
One of tge best real time strategy games ever made
Multiplayer lobby is down. We barely see rooms at the lobby( 2 rooms at most). Steam or aoe developers doesn't even response. This game is not fun at all if i can't play it online. I don't recommend it till it is fixed.
BEST GAME EVER! ignore Nurse Spam Pam Wench - she just has sand in naughty places
multiplayer lags terribly with this game as is expected for its age.
"Remake of a Brilliant RTS for its time, that being the problem, I'm afraid time doesn't always help, this is one of those game that hasn't Aged well. (no pun intended)  Age of empires was a great game, 10 years ago what lies in the past should stay in the past and be remembered for what it was. "
"I wont talk much about this game, because it is the same as it was over 10 years ago. Nothing really changed (which isnt bad) and I am glad to see steam becoming a library for classic products, that would be long forgotten. But charging over 20 Euros (The games price was 50 D-Mark = 25 Euro in the past) for such an old game is outraging. To top this, they want more money for an expansion set, that was community made and can be installed for free on the internet.  Month before Steams AoE2 was released I was playing the old version of the game on GameRanger, where it runs more stable, has equal patchs and new good features.  If you have your old AoE2 CD, install it and use GameRanger. If you never have played this game, wait until it is reduced. Stopping modern gaming industry from going down the hill, by releasing old games as new games, because the new games arent that big burner anymore, wont solve the problem."
great game
"BAD, Do not buy this game. Play the old version on Voobly. This new HD muiltiplayer is buggy and laggy, frequently crashes on match launch and in game, and thats when the ingame lobby browser works. "
Choose persians and build castle then spam elephants there you got master elo

However, when you actually get into it, the god-awful, impractical AI screws you over so many times to the point where it becomes game-breaking and hard to look past.

PROS:  +Fun in its own right +Great commitment to not include any historical inaccuracies (Fun for history nerds) +Neat little reading about the history of the civilizations included in the game +Awesome nostalgic appeal +Well-fitting art that contributes to the overall aesthetic of the game +Lots in in-game options that let you manage both the political and military aspects of your faction +Multiplayer works, for the most part   CONS:  -FPS dips (this is a 15yo game!) -Game-breaking stuttery pathfinding leads to your units being easily dispatched by their enemies -Horrible AI -Confusing objectives that punish you for not doing them a specific way -Enemies seem completely OP in some situations -Multiplayer crashes the game almost every other session -Singleplayer campaigns require an autistic savant level of foresight and management   All in all, do not buy this game unless it's on sale.

After that there comes an intro of Microsoft, which doesn't goes through completly, because it closes itself. Then the Steamwindow opens, telling me it's installing. Shows me 1% and then a bug message comes up, saying the servers are overloaded with a '(41)' like this and a link to steam support behind it. I will search for a solution, but paying 20€ and then this, without chance of giving it back seems ridiculous to me."

A clearly improved uppon version of AOE2. The game itself is quite good but what makes me not recommend this game is the lack of offline LAN a function that MANY players loved with the original. Do not buy this. The original has LAN and just has a bit less awsome graphics and such.
"AoE II &gt; AoE III. STEAM Workshop has decent maps &amp; mods with ahuge community. The editor is well made, easy to use, and perhaps the easiest way to submit a map to Steam Workshop. Playing home-made maps with friends is a snap. Ultimately, certain aspects of 'Stronghold' and 'EARTH 2160' are superior, but this one has it's charm, especially since it's more accessible. If 'Banished' had armies it would be better... However, all of these games are missing elements of the others. What's great? People still play the multiplayer online, everyday. The other communities are dead &amp; you will need forum friends to get your game going. What's horrific? The racism. Next to Sid Meier, these guys hate other cultures more than most, parading ethnocentric values like the stereotypes are realistic. All of these games are cowardly for attempting forget religious / commodity history. All the same, I play them waiting for the truth. Beyond that it's a gem. The HD edition elminates past networking headaches providing a creative renaissance for 'Age of Empires II' where old fans meet new."
FPS in multiplayer is about 1.
"The game is just as great as it was before And AI as stupid as it was - just attacks, no defence, no tactics, nothing :) Like in good old AoE. But it's great anyway :)"
"What can I say about Age of Empires 2- Really, it is very hard to find a place to begin that adequately gives this game credit. Age of Empires 2 is one of the best old school rts games ever made and the HD Edition just makes that so much more clear (literally).   Between the new content via expansion packs, additional compatibility with newer OSes, Steamworks and workshop support there is just so much here on offer. Some may say that the graphics are not improved enough, that the game still looks old and to them I say- yes. So? This is a HD remaster rather than a HD remake and with a game like this which has aged very well that is all we really needed.  Age of Empires 2 boasts a massive array of empires to use, each with their own tile sets and unique special units. It has a full map editor which allows for certain scripted events, a series of full campaign maps and a scenario/skirmish mode significantly buffed with additional features. You can really tell the people who did this remaster really love the game.  In this day and age where NEW traditional RTS games are few and far between (I am looking at you grey goo) Age of Empires 2 will always be welcome. All we can hope for now is an eventual revival to the core game series and a remaster of the original Age of Empires.  "
"This Game will not run, Keeps crashing,"
Awesome. other than the people that have 1500 - elo but play like a 2000
One of the best RTS games out there.
"A blast from the past. There are a lot of issues plaguing multiplayer though, such as ocasional disconnects and huge lags. Rating system cannot be trusted as you lose points after a D/C and/or gain points after the other player D/Cs, so all in all it just keeps going up and down. The lobby interface could house some additional info as well."
"A must for any Age of Empires fan. 'Remade' in HD supporting high resolutions and running at a fluid 60FPS, Steam workshop with great mods to further enhance the game's looks. A great improvement from the original.  The Forgotten expansion adds even more civilizations and other great features that further complete the game."
"A really nice reincarnation of the classig RTS Age of Empires 2. It also includes the expansion 'The Conquerors'. With some graphical updates and changes and the new ability to use Steam Workshop created Texture Packs, I'm definitely happy I bought this. If you can pick up a 50% off coupon through Steam Trading try to. It'll save you ten bucks. :)  I haven't bought the Forgotten DLC yet, but am excited about it and probably will buy it sometime soon."
"If you even know what this is, you've played it already, and anything I write here won't change your mind."
"I grew up on Age of Empires I-II and the HD release was almost the same as it was back in the days. The HD version is basicly a 'bugfix' and 'under the hood' modernization package (which might give you a good reason to hate the price tag). The color issue fixed, multiplayed upgraded and the screen resolution is fully elastic now. I loved it! If you were AOE fan in the previous century you should give a try to the HD edition."
"This is game is a definite purchase. It's a great addition to the series, bringing some needed content to further the experience. Olly's sucks the fatties Chode"
Glad that it's been made compatible with the latest Windows operating systems but omg please add Mac or at least Linux as well.
chess game
This game is amazing.  Best strategy in my opinion.
fun game age of empires never got old never will not even after 10 years :)
really fun game
"This is the best game ever made ever. Warcraft 3, Dune 2000, Cossacks and any other RTS does not compare. EVER!"
that nostalgia tho

"Still a classic. I always find enjoyment in this game. While the graphics are not super bad, the 500 population cap in the forgotten expansion works great. This can also be run well on a mac through wine just make sure to skip the load screen."
this game is the best thing i have ever played!
"Reccomend to anyone who 1) likes strategy games, 2) to achieve madness and Diplomatic negotiation and 3) to conquer every single empire you come across...SO MANY MEMORIES!!!"
"Adds replay value to this classic RTS, Wololo your friends once more! (7.5/10)"
Everything
ludaKRIS maps are awesome
So happy they brought this game back with updated graphics! Really fun game and it's my childhood game so I can't complain!
A pretty bad 'HDification' but a classic none the less.
Do i really need to try to sell this game to you? If you havent played it you don't know what you're missing.
This was one of the first PC games I ever owned (Pre-steam) and it's still amazing to this day :D 10/10
I think this is the best Age of Empires ever!!!
"A classic, and one of the best RTS of all time. It's not quite as 'HD' as I would like it to be, but higher resolution support is nice, and so is steam workshop integration and not having to deal with Explorer.exe breaking the game's colors."
"This is a very awesome game, the original is too. The multiplayer is really fun with your friends, but it gets pretty laggy with any match that has more than 3 players."
"Classic RTS, must get for any RTS fan!"
It's like starcraft without guns
BUY THIS GAME ITS ON SALE!
"This game brings back so many memories of LAN parties when I was younger, and the HD version with fan made content makes that only better. This game is just one of those classic RTS games that everyone needs to play, unless you don't like RTS games for some strange reason. Even if that is the reason, still no reason to not give it a shot."
Solid Game 15 years on..
follow
Great game!!
Conquering people with my SO is quite fun.
"i was currently building a nice village, people are working on farms and cutting weed. i have some soldiers ready to defend. 500 elephants incoming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     DED"
"I don't like this *wollo loooo* I love this game. Honestly? This is part of me growing up, using jimmy cheesesteak and spending hours and weeks with this. It's a classic for sure."
This game is so addicting I played it for 17 hours straight on accident. I couldn't stop.
This game is so freaking sweet.
Old but gold.One of my favourite games of all time.
One of the best RTS games ever made. Still great to play in multiplayer after all these years!
A great game that gets better with age.
My childhood is back. in 1080p.
Much better than AOE III
"Made an army of monks, fully upgraded, went into their village and converted their castles. The castles killed their base for me. 8/10 since wololo."
"A very fun game, I played it all the time when i was a kid. I was thrilled when it was released on steam and in HD to boot. Would definatly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Starcraft or other strategy games 9/10"
Its a classic that you can never seem to get enough of! 10/10
"Good game, since my first time in 2001 best ever. Keep on playing!"
"Just classic, an awesome game to play even after so many years."
"Very enjoyable game. Great for those who miss the original release, or those who missed it the first time around. I'd recomment the Rize of Nations re-release over this one, but both are very good."
"I like the gameplay as well as the multiplayer aspect of it, it is very smooth while playing by yourself and is also a very good  RTS with many usefull features."
"This is a long time favourite game of mine and a world renowned streategy game and it is good to see it being revived so i can launce a armageddon force against a person had never played befor and recking them befor they get into the castle age. it is a major nostalgia hit that is welcome into my heart. any person new to stratergy games SHOULD PLAY THIS it is a great introduction to the genre and also presents a chalange to veterans, esentially im describing the counter strike of the stratergy game."
"The first PC game I ever played for more than 10 minutes, hours of fun with or without internet connection. A first choice for strategy games at LAN events."
Peerless addition to the AOE saga.   But where are my rogans and wololos?  Also some of the best time I've ever had spamming opponents online. Like...ever. Wow.
"Though Age of Empires II: HD Edition shows its age, the game still demonstrates the important core features of an excellent RTS. While $20 may be a bit steep for all but the hardcore nostalgic player, picking this game up during a steam sale is highly recommended. I will be returning to this game! "
"A return to possibly one of the best RTS games I have ever played. It has the same epic feel it had over 10 years ago when I first played it, if you enjoy playing RTS games this is definitely a must play, worth every penny."
"Great Game, very strategic and hard to master a certain style for a race of people because of the depth the game goes into (like strengths and weaknesses). Overall it's a well balanced game and is all based on your skill level to win the game."
"Yes, I love this game. Played the orginal years ago. So happy it is now updated and has great steam integration. The strategy genre doesn't get a whole lot of good new games and this is a breath of fresh air from the past. Just as fun and good as the original."
Kudos to Steam for intorducing this ultimate classic! Works well with all versions of Windows. :D
I liked this game back then when it first came out. I like to come back to it from time to time to play again. Making it HD was a nice touch.
5 Stars! The memories of me and my brother playing this. Now we play multiplayer and have such funny and good games that go on for a few hours of great fun :D
bot built dock in 2 x 2 block of water  13/10 very good
"Alright, ♥♥♥♥ the meta score, the game deserves 90 or higher. You're basically getting a super fun history lesson when you're playing the campaign in single player while you and your friends can build up civs and mess around in the multiplayer. The only thing this game needed was additional civs to play as and they added those in the forgotten expansion, so kudos to the developers. I've gone out and bought all the Age of Empire games and in my opinion this was they best one they're created."
"Great old school RTS games. One of my favorites. Shows its age a little bit, escpecially with the hd remake Age of Mythology available. Newcomers may be turned off by the micromanagement and slower pace, but it's great nostalgia."
this game is a fun
8/10
"It is bloody brilliant, but only when Liam and Danny can be bothered to get their fat arses online!"
"I personally just love how perfectly awkward the Microsoft team were when they were writing out the description for the achievements, even trying to shoehorn a dry little pun somewhere in there.  Overall, I get to relive my childhood and more, it's a sickly sweet sensation of how deeply misguided I was when I thought I was a boss for facing 7 teams on a standard difficulty death match. Jesus, Mary and Joseph! It's a love hate thing where I know I'm playing against bots that I know I can beat but fearing the failure and utter defeat if I turn the game up to moderate.  Age of Empires is serious business, don't kid around."
come back to ages of empires 10 years down line still as awesome as was back then william wallace teaches all
"Right in the childhood, nostalgic all the way and Longbowmen in large groups can get rid of most armies &lt;3 10/10"
This game is a must for everyone who likes strategy games. It's a classic and there still is a huge amount of people who plays the game both on singleplayer and multiplayer (online).

"Excellent RTS game (had it way before steam). Some old bug have been fixed, which is great. Good dev support (lots of patch).  What are you waiting for ?  My kingdom for a monkey !"
For me this was the best of the AoE series. To be able to play it on a modern PC is great. And not to mention its alot easier to get an online game going with this steam version!
Nice game. :)
Graphics 4.0 Sound 4.5 Controls 4.5 Fun Factor 5.0  A classic that we all came to enjoy. Conquering with your favorite civilization was never more fun.
This game is Age of Empires 2. in HD. what more could you possibly want
It's good. Thumbs up.
After all these years it's still awesome.
"Classic one, what can I say more?"
Well i think everyone has heard or even played age of empires.. There is nothing better than sitting down and relaxing while playing this game. Contains thousands of hours of awesome game-play and i cannot wait to get stuck in to this old school classic. Pick up a copy for yourself. You will be supprised. :)
It's good ( wouuld rather have Age of Empires Online )
"Fantastic they brought this game back, it's a must buy if you played it in your childhood."
It's not bad
"I have been playing this game for years and was exited when I found out about steam. This is maybe the best game I have ever played and will ever play. I reccomend this to all of my friends. This game is great to play with friends. If you have the money and a few friends then I highly reccomend buying this. True stratagy and an awesome game over all. If you have this game non-steam I still reccomend this. Steam has made so many great improvements (My favorite being alot higher population.). Also Steam makes this game's multi-player capabilitys awesome, I mean all you have to do is go to lobby and there are tons of games to join! 10\10 buy it and you will not be sorry"
"Great game, I remember when I was a kid playing this with the family.. Me, my mom, my sister, and my brother, all on different computers playing versus each other, great time.. I'm just glad I can play it again! I get some rediculous, unplayable lag when I set the map size to the max and population to 500, but that's about the only problem I have with this awesome game!  10/10  If you have the money, get it, you wont regret it."
This is a great game i used to play this when i was a little kid. &lt;3 this so much
Graphics seem improved over the AOE2 I remember. AI is still awful and there's a considerable amount of lag when you hit the population cap of 500.
fun game get this!!!
Classic RTS - nostalgia and buggy units. Classic. Love It.
"Classic game, worth buying."
"Love this series, I don't notice a huge difference between this version and the regular AOE2 but then I downloaded terrain skins etc and it made a huge difference!"
fun as all hell
"First game I ever played, a lot of fun and a great classic"
This game is great. I've been playing it since I was a child and the updates in this version just make it that much better with the graphics update and population limit increases. Buy this game. Just do it.
"A good trip down memory lane, though HD remake is kind of underwhelming. Get a friend and create some mayhem against other countries in this rts classic!"
"+Timeless gameplay, enjoyable,  +you can have 2-3 hour matches.  +Extra fun with friends. "
I have loved this game since the day I first played years ago. A great game for LAN parties or to just play with your friends online. A.I. in the game is cool but the opponents need to be more aggressive. Maybe there is a setting to change that? Opponets are too hot to build wonders so matches end quickly. I love the drawn-out games that keep me going for hours sometimes. Seriously though 9/10 stars!!!!
"Yay, it looks very good and plays very fun. Yet there is FPS problems in multiplayer =("
"Amazing game, going from easiest difficulty to the next one up though is a massive change."
This game is an absolute classic! I played it to death when I was younger and this brings back the memories. The forgotten add on is quite fun too.
"Love the game, aside from a few bugs, its not that bad. Wish my subscriptions would work, and could download custom scenarios via lobby from host."
"Age of Empires II is one of the best games I have played in my entire life! I've been playing this game with my dad on Windows 98 since I was about 7 and I'm still playing it to this day. HD was the perfect upgrade from the original game. There are a lot of updates too. There is also a LOT of strategy involved and a LOT of amazing players. Be careful of what you do because one messup, and you are either dead or out of resources. I highly recommend you buy this game and play online. Rating: 10/10"
i love it a remake of a good classic
"I love this game! I remember playing this along with warcraft 3 as a kid and loving it to death. Does it hold up now a days tho? The answer is a simple yes. Both single player and multiplayer offer endless hours of fun and allow you to experience a simple yet complex RTS. AoE 2 HD is not only well worth the money but is value for the dollar. There are plenty of maps, gamemodes and civilizations to choose from. AoE 2HD is one of those games that is simple to play but hard to master. Learning the game does not require much effort with the help of the in depth and campaign based tutorial and story mode. 9/10"
Excellent remake would recommend
♥♥♥♥ing best game to play when you're bored at a friends house waiting for a friend to get home...
Love the ramake! Amazing quiality with the same features as the original game!
"A flashback from that past that is guaranteed to please the most die-hard, hardcore gamers from the past."
"Nice game, lets you remember the LAN-party-time in the 90ths, should have more bugfixes for win 7 and win 8.1!"
"I adored this game as a little kid, back when AOE II was still just Age of Kings. With the reboot of Kings, plus Conquerors, plus the new Forgotten Campaigns, it's already a treasure trove to grab given that it's now able to be played multiplayer over steam and has access to Steam's Workshop. The graphics re-skin, while not majorly noticeable, updated the game for modern computers and has made it playable. If you've got $25 to spare, grab this and its DLC for sure."
great game
"'ALL HAIL KING OF THE LOSERS' Age of Empires II is a classic RTS that defined a generation of RTS's. The gameplay is awesome, great for LAN parties. The game also has a Coop mode that seems to have never been replicated by another RTS. Along with all of that the taunts when playing head to head with friends is truly glorious. The graphics are a little aged (pun intended) but still has quality gameplay that holds up today. If you love RTS's pick this gem up on sale it will be well worth the money.  Rate: 8/8"
You will lose to the horde of troops that the AI build no matter what  10\10
One of my favorites!
This game gave me ebola 10/10
"Loved this game since I was a little kid, Although there are some issues with multiplayer, I am glad this great game is getting the support it deserves."
"This game is definately worth the money. Played it for years, and its just as fun in singleplayer as in multiplayer with friends."
Used to play this game when I was a kid. It's even better with the steam multiplayer. If you used to like this game I couldn't recommend this more.
Totally worth it.
Amazing classic; Great to play with old friends.  10/10  Perfect re-make; love the steam workshop support; Great multi-player
"Right in the childhood, nostalgic all the way and Longbowmen in large groups can get rid of most armies &lt;3 10/10"

This game takes me back to my childhood. Such a simple and pleasing game but still challenging.
"This game is a classic.  I played this game a ton when I was a kid, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this new edition. Even though this is essentially a re-skin (if you don't pick up the DLC, which you SHOULD), I personally think it was totally worth the 10 bucks I got it for. If you're intrested in a strategy game that doesn't have an intense and hightly competeitive multiplayer scene, which is what turned me off of Starcraft from the beginning, this game is worth considering. Especially if you get a couple of friends to buy in with you.  "
Age of Empires is like crack.   10/10 would hit again.
"it's tight af, lots of nice new features like upping speed past 'fast', high res support, and 200+ pop options."
"This game has its ups and downs, such as the fact that there isnt much change to the game itself, multiplayer can get extremely slow, and single-player is mostly boring (unless you get The Forgotten Empires Expasion), but the game is much more fun with close friends, vast variety of units, civilizations, game types and maps to choose from, and an incredible map/campaign designer to create your own story scenarios and maps. To me, this game is worth the pay of $5.00 (if it is on sale) or $20.00, and it deserves a higher metascore :)"
"Great game, fun to play, but games take a long time per match, and losing sucks. But, if you're into that kind of thing and have that much time to dedicate, then this is a great game."
grew up watching my dad play this and this is one of my favourite games on here so far!
Great classic game refreshed and release to show the gamers of today one of the big time game changers for the RTS genre!
"It's AoE:2, but higher res. There's not much more to be said."
OMG ITS SOO COOL!
Who doesn't love this game?
Consumed my teenage years. Amazing RTS 10/10
"It's mega fun, just like in the good old days!  This game still manages to keep me behind the PC from dawn to dusk :-)  Remember the ICQ direct IP games we used to play?  STEAM is slowly but surely ironing out the bugs.  Join in the fun :-)"
"This game brings back memories from when it first came out. I used to play this game for hours on end and host LAN parties with my neighbors. I still love this game and am very glad that Steam released it on their store with updated graphics and audio, as well as some bug fixes. This game game is very fun. It is not as fast paced as StarCraft and concentrates more on the long-term macro which is just one aspect that makes it a perfect buy."
This game is amazing.  Best strategy in my opinion.
chess game
one word 'Classic' 10/10
"Great game, still to this day. The HD edition makes it run marvelously on new age machines. I love being able to tell my history professor that he is wrong. I ruled the Persian empire and conquered the Aztecs."
"This is one of my favorite games of all time, no doubt about it. I love RTS games, and the setting of this one in particular is fantastic. I've been familiar with it since I was a kid, and I have never grown tired of it. No two games are alike. The map is always different, and being able to find a civilization you like and learn all of its tricks, then moving on to another one if you so choose, is awesome. My only complaint is that the designers of this HD edition didn't raise the population cap up from 75 on the Age of Kings campaigns, making the old campaigns, while still very fun, a bit of a hassle when trying to balance economy and military. All in all though, the good things about this game (basically everything) outweigh that one negative. And in reality, the campaigns are optional because there's so much else to do. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RTS games, or just medieval-set games.   P.S. Franks rule!"
A classic in HD!! Highly recommended!
How to lose friends and become know as a snake. Much recommend.   6/2 Will plot again
"It's still amazing, even with the game being so old. The HD remake didn't ♥♥♥♥ it up, but made it a better and bigger experience! The fact that the entity amount has increased to 500 means you can have to most epic battles ever. Still loving it, even after 8 years of playing it. (The original game as well)"
"When I was child, my father bought a computer for our house, the first program to be installed was this game, I am having nostalgic feelings of hating this game for the population cap of 85 that I used to have because I didn't know how to edit the settings in the options menu, another thing that I didn't like either was that all the factions shared the same kind of units, except for a few extras achieved through technologies and castles, not enough for me, When I heard this game was getting re released through steam I got excited and finally bought it hoping for the community to provide a far wider selection of units unique to their faction, sadly no mod as such can be found in the internet.  Depleted my gold deposits and panicked, massacred civilizations for their gold deposits, 10/10 made me a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"
"Really Fun game, to remember old times, totally recommended."
"a classical game, that has stood time."

"A flashback from that past that is guaranteed to please the most die-hard, hardcore gamers from the past."
BRINGS ME BACK TO CHILDHOOD.
"A great relaunch of a classic in gaming history. I loved every minute of it before and I love every minute of it now.  Too expand on this, even by today's standards the game holds true as (possibly) the best RTS available. With better support for larger armies, larger navies, larger towns, and larger forts, this game really breaks the tendencies of other RTS's (including AoE 3) to be more like skrimisheses than actual battles."
"Food, please. Wood, please."
"This is basically Age Of Empires II, only with widescreen support. The model quality is not improved much at all, the animations are still exactly the same as AoF 2 and the AI haven't seen any change. The video and audio options are very limited, for example: you can't even change the resolution. The graphical enhancement is talking on it's own, as almost everything in the Steam workshop is graphical enhancements. The main menu is identical to the previous one in every way, it doesn't even look as if it has a resolution scale of 16:9, feels more like it's 4:3. All this aside, it's still a very good game, and if you liked the original, you will like this game!  I would recomend this game, but don't go into this game expecting very good graphics, because then you will get disappointed."
"What can I say. Easily my most favourite game on steam. This game is simply the best in it's genre, in my opinion at least. The Gameplay is perfect, the music nostalgic, and the graphics absolutely charming. This is a gilded strawberry, and you'll be stuck in keeping it forever or digesting it whole."
"LOL CANT WIN A 2V2 WONDERBOY HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH AZTECH RUSH THIS KID, VIKING WARRIORS BREAK YR TURRETLINE LELELELELEL YOU CAN SAY I WENT BEAR-ZERK. YOU BEAR-LY MADE IT, AND THEN BEAR-LY LOST IT. YOU WERE IN A GRIZZLY SITUATION, AND THEN LOST TO WONDERFUL WONDERS. 1000 STONE ALL I NEED TO CRUSH BABEH MAN. HOHOHO.  In other news, play the game. where micro is so hard, and macro is so soft, you'll wonder how to attack move. 10/10"
"An awesome game, fans of any kinf of RTSG will love this."
"good but bad, recommended"
bought the game found out it has no LAN support use cracked version to play onlan with friends. 9/10
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUMRUSHED ELEPHANTS AND TOOK ME OUT AFTER TWO HOURS  ♥♥♥♥ you  10/10 will play again
"I give this game a 4/5 stars. Although it is an old game, it is very fun to play with your friends. It is a very nice game that requires strategy, and planning. I love how it has many tribes and maps to play on, which makes your game expirience much better. If you want to buy DLC, I recommend the Forgotten Pack. It gives you more tribes to be, and if you know what your doing, they can do very good. ALERT: If you do not like games that take forever, this is not the game for you. Me and my friends play, and an average game takes atleast 2 hours. Overall it is a very good game. The only reason why I give it a 4/5 is that they could of added more ages to cycle through, with more buildings and militia. I love playing this game, and I hope they continue making good games like this one."
My first true love is back! &lt;3
"Though the game says HD in the name, it doesn't look HD as I expect an updated game to look. There is not graphics resolution setting available that I can see, there is the just the default graphics resolution which doesn't look very good to me."
Just look at every other game review site...this game lives up to it all.
You just can't stop playing it!!!
A classic that is still a classic and great fun
"Age of Empires 2 is the best strategy game of all time. This is the game which has stopped me from ever getting into Civ or Total War. I've tried them, but all I can think whilst playing them is 'it's not quite AoE, is it?'. And thats all I can say for this game is that it's excellent, the HD remake is gorgeous (but I somewhat miss the more nonchalent feeling of the older graphics), and the foragers are VERY comitted to picking berries. 10/10, enjoy it!"
"Good game. Only thing wrong with it is the 'under attack' sound file is the most annoying sound on Earth and can't be replaced because it's buried so deep , CSI can't find it."
Easily my favorite rts game :D
Classic RTS
complete lag on multiplayer for most people. no known solution. 2/10 would not buy again
"As Usual Age of Empires Series. Love the game as i love age of empires. Graphics lack alot to modern day standards but still a fun game, although a little overpriced Entertainment: 7/10 Grapics: 2/10 Cost: 5/10"
The higher resolution zooms the game too far out to play and there's no adjustable resolution option. Age of Empires II original had adjustable resolution! I'm just thankful steam has a refund policy now.
"A very fun game. The exact essence of the original Age of Empires II shines in this reboot. Naturally, a bit overpriced. Thanks to Microsoft :(. However, I would definetly recomend this game to anyone who loves the beauty of Ensemble Studios' old but not forgotten series."
"I can't recommend a 16 year old game when a modern PC that should be able to handle this game at 5000 FPS can't even get a steady 30 FPS. Multiplayer with only 3 players all with populations less than 100 and no armies, without even moving the camera around my FPS is randomly dropping as low as 16... Negative recommendation until FPS is fixed."
"It's Age of Empires II. You know, the 'good one'.  Seriously, if you want to know what pretty much every RTS is matched up against, play this game. It's basically the standard for RTS games, new and old."
"The title is misleading as it isn't a HD remake, but the game itself is brilliant as ever."
THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTLEY AWEFUL... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone should have this game and learn it.
"Wow, I had really forgotten how boring these kind of games were. All the tedious micro management and villagers standing idle a pixel away from their work and soldiers running for the wood for no apparent reason. Maybe this was OK when one was young and had all the time in the world but now it all just felt like a waste of game time. Sure, all games are a waste of time in some way but this was a boring waste of time. And that is the worst kind.  Graphics update was disappointing and texture mods only helped a little. Still felt like playing an old game and not in a good way.  Glad I bought it on sale and only wasted a little money. "
""
Great game.
Wololoo! is there more to say? Go &amp; Get it
i really like his game
8^|
"THE RTS.  I played so many AoE games in the early 2000's on dial up, my dad thought I was an addict.  I love this game. AoE III killed the series, but AoE II still lives on and is updated to this day!   How many other RTS's can say that?  This is by far one of the best RTS games of all time. Buy it. Now."
only issue is it lags balls online but still really fun
"Too many bugs, virtually unplayable: and even no help from the support staff after I complained"
I have loved this game but every time i play in now it crashes and i dont know why
WHY is my lobby bugged and how can i fix this!?
"i love this game, but currently i cannot play it because it is marked unavailable on my apps list any ideas how to fix it. I can't seem to get any info from either steam or microsoft "
"Played this game for over 10 years. True to the original game yet still definitely different. Opens up new opportunities for those who have played the game before with an extremely graspable learning curve for those who are total novices. The defining RTS’ of the previous decade, updated to become the defining RTS’ of this decade.  Score: 10/11"
Great and nostalgic games
"(Genghis Khan Campaign: Scenario 3 - Into China)  Spent 5 hours trying to knock down the Great Wall of China and defeat five gigantic Chinese empires within.  Had to send a grand total of eight gigantic army waves at separate times.  My first army wave was sent by ship, solely to blow up one building.  Consistently kept running out of resources.  More than once, I had to hide my villagers in transport ships and feebly fend of intense attacks.  Had to rebuild my camp, and then build it again inside Chinese territory while I watched the Tanguts demolish my empire.  Took five tries to beat this specific scenario. All of this was on the successful try.  Played on the easiest difficulty.  Never once did I think I was going to survive.  10/10 My soul is dead."
"This game is a classic! Even after so many years and so many games to choose from, this game is still the best!  I have only a few wishes for this game. 1) If it was available on Mac. 2) Why can't a villager be set on auto-repair!!!? I mean... AOM has it! RIGHT!! So the devs know about it!! grrr  If you are new to this game, be patient and take your time to learn this beautiful game. It's worth it.  As for pricing, It's dirt cheap for a good game with so much content."
Lag Lag and more lag.  Dont waste your money.
"After many attempts, the game runs at very high CPU usage and low FPS. After researching I found out lots of people are having the same problem even though the game is nearly twenty (20) years old. There aren't any optimisations done to make the game run faster on modern computers. Also you can't change the game resolution from the settings, the 'HD' part of the game is only scaling of the original game's resolution. If you have a big resolution screen, things are going to be too small on the screen and the game is not playable. Solution to this is scaling the desktop's resolution. In my opinion this game is highly overpriced since there are only negative things when compared to the original aoe2. Things would be different if the HD version ran smoothly and if a preferred resotion could be set."
xXSwag420BlazeItXx Gud game to pley wit yo homiez to settle CP3 VS John Wall. OBVI CP3 is better cp3 b on the clippers like omg do u even
its is good
Great games in that period.  But RTS is quite hard.
Great Classic game! A must buy if its on sale.
"I unfortunately got a lot less fun out of it than i was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine game. If you already have the old one don't bother with this one though."
"If you long for the good old days, this will be up your alley. Without the latest addons, the game isn't really worth it.  The HD term used, doesn't really add up apart from some water and fire fx. However the game doesn't have graphic errors like bad colour rendering anymore when playing on a windows version beyond xp. So that's worth the effort to.  All in all a nice game."
its great!
very good game love it
one of the best RTS games ever made!
best game out there!
I used to have this game when I was younger and I loved it. It’s simple to understand and it is fun.
The best strategy game ever. BUY RIGHT NOW. STOP READING!
"I loved this game when i was 10, and this remake bringing it back to life is great."
"I highly recommend this as a fun nostalgic RTS. The new water graphics are quite nice although some of the new hotkeys aren't intuitive and I personally preferred the old resource icons but that can be easily modded. So far I haven't encountered any bugs as the old disk version had a couple notorious ones (anyone who played as the Teutons can remeber that when they just start shouting holze holze. The gameplay remains engaging, the new graphics are a bonus, but best of all the game is available again. 10/10"
"Exactly the same as the original, only upgraded to HD so it can be played with today's operating systems. For those who always wanted to build and conquer with swords, bows &amp; arrows, and spears, this is a classic game you should get."
"A great classic but the HD part is a little overplayed, still fun though for a few rounds."
"One of the best in history of games. Perfect for lan partys, even if a game lasts a whole night."
"Old classic is reborn. I loved this game as a kid, and having it on steam is awesome. The developers are still working a few bugs. Most of the credit goes to Ensemble Studios for the origional design."
An all-time classic now in HD for all your war desires
The #1 Best RTS I've Ever Played!
"First game I ever owned on a CD instead of a floppy disc. Putting hundreds of hours into this remake now to play competitively. Good community, ive got new friends ive played games with every week for the last 3 months, with new people weekly. My number 1 game of all time, best bang for your buck if you like rts"
"Arsebreakingly hard, 2 much micro."
this game is very swell
Bish ples 
Classic!
"I've loved this game since it came out, Now in HD it gives a whole new Reason to play. Multiplayer matches, along with new hd textures. Great Game!"
I think it is okay ....
10/10 would play again
"Brings back the memories.... I recommend you purchase this on sale because the original, in 19 something wasnt even 20 bucks! AMAZING GAME."
"It's still amazing, even with the game being so old. The HD remake didn't ♥♥♥♥ it up, but made it a better and bigger experience! The fact that the entity amount has increased to 500 means you can have to most epic battles ever. Still loving it, even after 8 years of playing it. (The original game as well)"
"When I was child, my father bought a computer for our house, the first program to be installed was this game, I am having nostalgic feelings of hating this game for the population cap of 85 that I used to have because I didn't know how to edit the settings in the options menu, another thing that I didn't like either was that all the factions shared the same kind of units, except for a few extras achieved through technologies and castles, not enough for me, When I heard this game was getting re released through steam I got excited and finally bought it hoping for the community to provide a far wider selection of units unique to their faction, sadly no mod as such can be found in the internet.  Depleted my gold deposits and panicked, massacred civilizations for their gold deposits, 10/10 made me a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"
"Really Fun game, to remember old times, totally recommended."
"a classical game, that has stood time."
"Love the game, aside from a few bugs, its not that bad. Wish my subscriptions would work, and could download custom scenarios via lobby from host."
"Age of Empires II is one of the best games I have played in my entire life! I've been playing this game with my dad on Windows 98 since I was about 7 and I'm still playing it to this day. HD was the perfect upgrade from the original game. There are a lot of updates too. There is also a LOT of strategy involved and a LOT of amazing players. Be careful of what you do because one messup, and you are either dead or out of resources. I highly recommend you buy this game and play online. Rating: 10/10"
i love it a remake of a good classic
"I love this game! I remember playing this along with warcraft 3 as a kid and loving it to death. Does it hold up now a days tho? The answer is a simple yes. Both single player and multiplayer offer endless hours of fun and allow you to experience a simple yet complex RTS. AoE 2 HD is not only well worth the money but is value for the dollar. There are plenty of maps, gamemodes and civilizations to choose from. AoE 2HD is one of those games that is simple to play but hard to master. Learning the game does not require much effort with the help of the in depth and campaign based tutorial and story mode. 9/10"
you can spend 500 hours on just 1 game...  10/10
It is one of the world's best LAN games!!
"Wololo  One of the best strategy games of all time, if not the best."
made an aztec army and saved tenochitlan 10/10 would change history again
I WAS MAKING A COOL VILLAGE AND ♥♥♥♥ AND SOME DUMBASS SHEEP HAD A VIRUS IN THE MEAT SO WE DIED AT THE START LOL
My childhood! :D I welcome you!
"When it comes to games, this is one of them!"
"Played with three other friends , got destroyed because they thought they would get food for killing me. 10/10 would play again"
its ♥♥♥♥♥ good ay
classic game and totally worth the money
I changed the world with a sheep  10/10
This game is awesome.
Not great. I loved this game when it first came out. So when I saw that it had an HD version I had to get it. I wouldn't call this HD. I would recommend if under $10. It was $20 when I bought it.
  it's a good game but i cant move my mouse because the games starts to lag like ♥♥♥♥.
"Sick game, used to play when i was a kid, brought back good memories :)"
0/10 worst racing game i have ever played
"Thia game was my childhood, it was fun back then and even more fun now!"
10/10 would Wololo again.
LOL sweg is a Noob Uninstall the game
the best strategy game ever
A very good and addicting stratgy game
Brilliant!
"This is a great game for singleplayer but, personally, I do not find that as enjoyable as multiplayer.  The networking code behind the game is a mess. As such it makes it extremely difficult to play multiplayer games. There is constant freezing and disconnection causing interruption to the game.  I would suggest that it is OK to play singleplayer but I would not recommened buying the game in hopes of playing multiplayer."

"Love the game, Hate the players.  to those who insist on staying in the lobby saying 'I'LL GET IT FIXED PROMISE': ♥♥♥ you"
5/5

The nostalgia...
Goes into multiplayer server Creates giant army Destroys every enemy wins and spams '11' and '8'  The most dickish thing to do in the game.. Also the most hilarious.. XD 10/10
"The other day,Bubu told me to buy this game and u know something I bought it. This is a very good strategy game to play with ur friends except Boba. Hope u liked my review!  See u later!!!"
Thanks Gaben for 1080p edition.

Old but Go... forget it it's a ♥♥♥♥ing new precious masterpiece from another galaxy
I can only speak in AOE Taunts now. 100% worth it.
So happy I bought a new copy of a game I already owned two copies of and still have on CD somewhere for 19.99 now that it's on sale for 2.99 :D
I got this game on cd for long period and then i lost it I saw summer sales and buyed this gamed  1 minute in game HYPE  Awesome if u like old schoop building with old cool texture its fun to play with friends or bots
"A game that has yet to bore, an infinite amount of instances of battle now that the workshop has been intoduced. Fight your foes in the campaign or in your own scenarios, or battle your friends in multiplayer! Build your own maps to fight on! Cities, towns and empires can be built, it is only up to you to build them!"
"Why are you reading reviews? BUY IT, BUILD (AND REBUILD) CASTLES AND WOLOLO ALL OF THE THINGS!"
please tell me how nostalgia makes up for the fact that this game is literal ♥♥♥♥

"Age of Empires II HD is one of my favorite games. It takes place in Loompaland of the year 66, or better known as the yearbook age. My favorite civilization to play as was the Gordon Ramsay whose capital city was Blighttown. The main technology that advanced during this age was the production of stuffed teddy bears. I like the historical factors of seeing people from Disneyland fight people from Legoland. Some of the gloves they wear are incredible! I've seen blank warriors with swords made out of titanium and armor of silk that would rage in the sunlight. I had a vintage monk that had a robe made of wood who could slouch and grill while mooing. This monk also had a pet hippo that he kept with him. He later became known as King Leo the Hairy.   One of my favorite moments was during a siege of Candyland. The custom enemy was a group of enemies from Panda Express who specialized in using jello pudding to take down enemy walls. Luckily, I had just created towers that could shoot 60 volumes of Bleach at them. On the walls were also my shovel troops best known for shooting homicidal psycho jungle cats. The defense was slowly successful, but I had lost quite a few of my shovels.  As time passes, it is always important to make sure settlements are upgraded with the latest technology as you want to keep people dinky. I've found that when baboons strike the land and all the kingdoms get sick and 77 people die, its crucial to build giga drill breakers in each settlement. Also, building pencil sharpeners are critical as well when you want to make sure you can create lots of jars of dirt to fend off hoards of Mark Twain that come from the East. Many of these reasons are why I think this game is scientific.      Framework adapted from 'Total War Game' by Voidseer Libs on the Google Play Store   "
One of my all time favourite games. Have been playing for many years and the updates keep improving graphics and gameplay making the experience all the more enjoyable. Would definitely recommend trying this game at least once.
Old school fun 10/10
just type in 30 and enjoy :)
It's a really cool war game if you're winning.
"I've loved this game ever since I was a kid, this was basically my childhood. I still think that it is the best RTS ever made (other than StarCraft obviously)"
10/10 for awesome memories! Still a good strategy game.
This is a great game from about a decade ago  Yet the developers still update and support this game Which is good :3
I have no words for this game Literally the greatest game i've ever played in my life
Just like the good old days
Old but gold
5/7
I spent my childhood with this masterpeice
"Still great RTS game, even on these days. If you find yourself of having difficulties trying to play the original version on your modern machine, then check out the HD Edition. It provides many new features and enhancements, while still retaining the original gameplay, just like back in the original release date. And best of all, you don't have to worry about the compatibility, as it's designed to be working on the modern computers. Definitely worth it, if you're fan of RTS games."
"It had a rough and buggy launch, nearly decried as a flop, but by god did Microsoft turn it all around and fix a slew of game breaking issues in record time. With that rapid recovery came a slew of new features, an immense collection of useful mods and entertaining campaigns through the Steam Workshop, and even an all new expansion that doesn't disappoint. Today, AOEII HD is a great nostalgia-fest from which I had a terrible time breaking free. It's every bit as amazing as the classic AOEII experience, if not better. It was a preorder I did not regret, a title I have no qualms about recommending, and a gift I've taken pride in giving. I could not recommend AOEII HD more.  Update: We're now two expansions in, the game is still being patched frequently, all of the bugs and performance issues have been patched out of existence, and players are still enjoying it. It's safe to say this is an example of an HD remaster done right."
Been far? Decided to Use? Look more like! Call: 985-655-2500
its is good
dis game dis game  to good rude to AUS asses using Mcdonalds wifi and swarms of sige rams dis game  dis game  is the best
"This game has some of the worst unit AI I have ever seen in an RTS. Attack move is the most frustrating command to give your units in this game. If you are looking for a good old classic RTS, skip this game and get StarCraft 1."
"Leonardo is the biggest loser out of any of the ninja turtles, i swear to god he gives me a damn headache with his stupid pussface ♥♥♥♥ that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥"
one of the best RTS games ever made!
Great games in that period.  But RTS is quite hard.
"Though not the HD edition (obviously) I grew up with this game. amazing stories, well made strategy game!"
It's the game for my 17 !
"I remember playing this game when I was younger, and it is so much more fun now that I actually know what I'm doing! :D"
Great Game! It also brings out the nostalgia from the original and makes the game even more enjoyable
"So I waited until I got 20+ hours, and that just came really fast. Love RTS's? This is the game for you. No doubt. New to RTS's? This is also the game for you, again, no doubt."
My first true love is back! &lt;3
"Food, please. Wood, please."
" Age of Empires 2 is not only a classic, but one of the best RTS games ever made.  There are plenty of reviews for the game, and as such, I'm going to focus on this 'HD Edition'.   Visuals:  First off, there isn't any resolution control, or really any video options of any kind. In Fullscreen it stays at desktop resolution. Otherwise, the game looks alright. Everything is noticeably zoomed out (I'm playing at 2160x1440p on a 12' screen), sometimes more so than I'd like. They redid the animated flames and reverted the food icon from meat back to corn. No major revisions here, really just the high-resolution support.   Audio:  No complaints here. Same great soundtrack, same sound effects too. Didn't notice any changes, but I don't mind.   Additions:  Trading Cards, Achievements, Steam Workshop. Awesome. All the content from the old Conquerors Expansion is built-in, so that's a plus. Some might say that there isn't enough new, aside from the new 'The Forgotten Expansion'. I don't feel this way.   Misc:  It seems to me that the AI (individual unit AI ,that is) has some issues I don't recall occurring in AoE2. Units often freeze in place, not performing their leisurely animations. (ie. swaying back and forth.) Computer-controlled empires' armies may freeze temporarily as well. I'm not sure why.   Conclusion:  If you have a functional copy already and don't have any major problems with it, this might not be worth the money. Otherwise, get it. If you aren't a die-hard fan, maybe wait for a sale though."
BRINGS ME BACK TO CHILDHOOD.
"A great relaunch of a classic in gaming history. I loved every minute of it before and I love every minute of it now.  Too expand on this, even by today's standards the game holds true as (possibly) the best RTS available. With better support for larger armies, larger navies, larger towns, and larger forts, this game really breaks the tendencies of other RTS's (including AoE 3) to be more like skrimisheses than actual battles."
"Love the game, it is a must buy. The only thing that i would change is more nations to spice things up"
"Probably the best title this company has ever released. It's a fun, intense and strategic game. It brings every perspective you need to make a good RTS to the table. I have only been playing private pre made matches with bots for hours and it is still fun. I highly recommend playing the campaign and against friends 9/10"
"This is the Age of Empires you remember, completely unsullied, but now with the added benefit of the Steam Workshop, which allows not only the custom games of old but whatever crazy stuff people want to build for it now. Additionally, there's been an expansion to this already, which means this game is getting active developer attention, so many years after its original release! I'm pretty impressed."
"Positively sublime game; scratches the nostalgia itch but also a fantastic experience for newcomers. I'm really happy to see an HD, Steam-supported version. Makes multiplayer a breeze. If you see this game on sale and you don't have it yet, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to ignore it. I have nothing negative I could possibly say about this game. Pitch-perfect."
"Great game that I played as a kid, now it's on steam and i bought it again"
♥♥♥♥!!! 22 quid spent and it dont ♥♥♥♥ing work!!!!
yea its fun 
"I had three men to start off with, bred over 100 villagers from them. '100/10 so realistic' - IGN"
"Played this game A LOT in the past (before steam).  Why I like it: It remains one of the best Age of Empires for me personally. I still remember those photonguys, that was funny. Building walls around my territory so I can get all the resources for myself haha really good old days. It has got it all, might be old but still worth it.  Does it work? Works on Win7 64 bit.  Recommend? Worth buying anytime. YES."
Wololoo! is there more to say? Go &amp; Get it
"THE RTS.  I played so many AoE games in the early 2000's on dial up, my dad thought I was an addict.  I love this game. AoE III killed the series, but AoE II still lives on and is updated to this day!   How many other RTS's can say that?  This is by far one of the best RTS games of all time. Buy it. Now."
THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTLEY AWEFUL... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone should have this game and learn it.
"I bought the game and after a while I discovered that the game is not HD, The solution?"
"Sadly this game will no longer start up whenever i try to play it. Hoping they will fix this, a fun game but currently broken "
"This game was probably the first strategy game I've ever played and I remembered that I used to be  good  at this game.  However, this game hasn't aged that well for one simple thing: a pause button. With almost 15 years since I last played this, RTS strategy games have moved on to implement this simple feature. It's like playing old shooters without automatic healing, arguably it makes everything less challenging, but for an RTS, it makes micromanaging a bit of a living hell as you are restricted to one playstyle and that is  rush everything!   Regardless of that fact though, it's still a very solid game with countless of hours of gameplay and it's one other reliable timesink for all of you who seem to think you have unlimited time on Earth. Just expect a very simple mechanics that is probably geared towards war more than economy or diplomacy. If you're looking to micromanage huge Empires, there are other games that have done it better since then in many ways such as Civilization series, Paradox games such as Europa Universalis and Victoria II, or the Total War series. Age of Empires II is probably very limited to strictly nostalgia or multiplayer games in today's plentiful RTS games."
"I have like 20 minutes played, so ... ummm ... it's ok :S"
"Worst performing game of all time. Ever.  Someone took an awesome classic which performed perfectly and made it perform terribly in multiplayer.  Games Desync constantly, getting 1 fps at times on a computer that can run all the best new games on Ultra at 2560x1440.  Recommend the game on its own, but this version is woeful."
had a blast on my first game even tho i was carried
"I've played this game for 200 hours now, and it still amazes me! :D I highly recommend this game because of it's integrity and brilliantness."
Wololoo! is there more to say? Go &amp; Get it
Great game.
"A great real time strategy game from the 90s just made to run on newer systems. The core game is exactly the same as the original, just higher resolutions and a few added scenarios and playable races. If you liked AoE 2 when it first came out, or wanted to play it but never had the ability before, this is your chance."
Good fun destroying my friends - just like the original. Thumbs up to the developers!
10/10 would fight the enemy again!
"Not finished  The child hood memories... ah. What a great game. If you don't know what this game is, where was your childhood?!  Since this review is only on the HD edition additions, it will not include the actual gameplay of the game.  The HD edition doesn't mean the textures are changed to 'HD'. What was changed was the screen resolution, which will allow you to play the game in *Full* screen. Some textures are changed, yes, but not changed to a higher definition, they still look similar. Also added was a online multiplayer connected to Steam. The online multiplayer seems to have very little bugs, and I haven't experienced any crashing (Except when you spam the voice commands). You can also connect to the Steam workshop and download things there.   There is also new DLC, AOEII The Forgotten. It adds some new campaign levels, seems to make the AI somewhat better, and adds new civilizations. You should buy it! Especially when it is on sale!"
Kick some ancient ♥♥♥
really fun game
"This is the best game ever made ever. Warcraft 3, Dune 2000, Cossacks and any other RTS does not compare. EVER!"
"This is game is a definite purchase. It's a great addition to the series, bringing some needed content to further the experience. Olly's sucks the fatties Chode"
"I loved this game when i was 10, and this remake bringing it back to life is great."
love all of the game series
The game is great the tech support is a failure. Cannot play game due to server being overloaded. This has been going on for the last 2 weeks and no help.
Age of Empires just like in the old days !! :) And now with online matches also
Bish ples 
good game as far as offline goes but as for online what a joke laggy as all hell and theres basically no one ever online dead game is dead
"Age of Empire II is a very good and fun game. It has a bit of a learning curve as most of these games with hot keys and what not. But as far as the game itself is? its awesome! the graphics look good and having a large army that fights the AI in a bloody death battle is really fun! I can say this is a very fun game to play with friends buuuuuuuuuuut you both have you to really know what you are doing because of one of you is really good and one of you is not , the new guy will die. But this game has allot of hours you can sink into it. 7/10 learning curve :L"
horrible. they are just useing this title to cash in on the fans for $$$ big mistake on buying it with bogus quick money grab dlcs that kill the workshop almost makeing you buy every dlc to stay updated.
"Game is my childhood. Buy it, but only play with friends in LAN: online multiplayer quality sucks. Apart from that?  Best ♥♥♥♥in' RTS in the WORLD, buy it and buy copies for your friends. Wait for it to be 75% off tho."
"Great game, small changes to original, but optimized for PC. Don't expect HD graphics though, it still has the original graphics as well, great if your looking for an RTS with a community to play with, which is something most RTS's dont have currently."
LOL sweg is a Noob Uninstall the game
"This old classic suprised me very pleasantly. Not only does it come with much better graphics, but even has some overall improvements, like hotkey picking for actions that actually makes sense. And it even comes with its own unique expansion (The Forgotten).  Another good thing is that if you had collor problems with the original version (a common issue that I have experienced), those dissappear too!  It's a very well made version of a great game of many peoples childhoods, so what's not to love! But in the end, even though unless you buy the expansion, it doesn't really introduce new gameplay, it is still wololo worth it! :D"
"Good remake of the second age of empires, (I personally started out on age of empires 3, i liked it so i bought 2 HD edition and i just cant get use to the gameplay differences, but overall 9/10. good game."
Review coming soon!
"The original AOE2 is my very first PC game, and the HD Edition still manages to occupy me for hundreds of hours."
"One of the best game from 2000's.I bet we played Age of Empires 2 more than our current AOE2 Steam hours.I cant imagine how many hours it was it.500-600 even more than 1000hours? Yea probably.So AOE2 is an opportunity for us to play this legendary game again on our modern computers.Lets talk about the game little bit;  First everything is pretty much same.I dont know why they called it as HD edition.Graphics are pretty much same. There are 2 big opportunities are waiting for us. -First they have added new campaign which is comes with The Forgotten Expansion.I really recommend it.New nations,building,maps and units -How many times we had a lot problems tried to play AOE2 with our friends.We tried some applicatins such as Hamachi.Anyways we dont need it anymore.Just click on multiplayer button on the main page and get ready for your fight.  I hope AOE2 will get even more players.Such as new generation players.Because it is a really legendary game"
this game is definely worth buying
One of the best strategy games to date
"Classic AoE II in HD edition, what else do you want?!"
This is probably my favorite game of all time. It always has been. Love the new HD version. Love the new civilizations to play in the new expansion. This game has always been amazing. I have tried other RTS games through the years and they never compete with AOE II.
"The re-release of this acclaimed Ensemble Studios classic is a welcome sight to the world of Real Time Strategy if not for the countless and debilitating bugs, oversights, and multiplayer issues that the developers have repeatedly shown they are incapable or unwilling to fix."
Eveytime I play multiplayer I get spammed with wololo whats up with that ? anyway great game for the time and age. still enjoyable today and I reccommend grouping up with a couple of friends 8/10
:)
Cant even start the game now 10/10  (and support doesnt seem to give a damn)
bot built dock in 2 x 2 block of water  13/10 very good
"Alright, ♥♥♥♥ the meta score, the game deserves 90 or higher. You're basically getting a super fun history lesson when you're playing the campaign in single player while you and your friends can build up civs and mess around in the multiplayer. The only thing this game needed was additional civs to play as and they added those in the forgotten expansion, so kudos to the developers. I've gone out and bought all the Age of Empire games and in my opinion this was they best one they're created."
"Great old school RTS games. One of my favorites. Shows its age a little bit, escpecially with the hd remake Age of Mythology available. Newcomers may be turned off by the micromanagement and slower pace, but it's great nostalgia."
this game is a fun
8/10
"It is bloody brilliant, but only when Liam and Danny can be bothered to get their fat arses online!"
"I personally just love how perfectly awkward the Microsoft team were when they were writing out the description for the achievements, even trying to shoehorn a dry little pun somewhere in there.  Overall, I get to relive my childhood and more, it's a sickly sweet sensation of how deeply misguided I was when I thought I was a boss for facing 7 teams on a standard difficulty death match. Jesus, Mary and Joseph! It's a love hate thing where I know I'm playing against bots that I know I can beat but fearing the failure and utter defeat if I turn the game up to moderate.  Age of Empires is serious business, don't kid around."
come back to ages of empires 10 years down line still as awesome as was back then william wallace teaches all
freaking amazing game. I just completely obliterated the chinese with 300 Samurai
"A good trip down memory lane, though HD remake is kind of underwhelming. Get a friend and create some mayhem against other countries in this rts classic!"
"+Timeless gameplay, enjoyable,  +you can have 2-3 hour matches.  +Extra fun with friends. "
I have loved this game since the day I first played years ago. A great game for LAN parties or to just play with your friends online. A.I. in the game is cool but the opponents need to be more aggressive. Maybe there is a setting to change that? Opponets are too hot to build wonders so matches end quickly. I love the drawn-out games that keep me going for hours sometimes. Seriously though 9/10 stars!!!!
"Yay, it looks very good and plays very fun. Yet there is FPS problems in multiplayer =("
"Amazing game, going from easiest difficulty to the next one up though is a massive change."
This game is an absolute classic! I played it to death when I was younger and this brings back the memories. The forgotten add on is quite fun too.
"A Timeless classic reborn in HD. The Age Of Empires series stands upon one of the three pillars of RTS royalty with the other two being Comand and Conquor and Dawn of War. AOE is one of those games you can spend hours on just fiddling away, building up a strong empire only to loose it when you win. But thats half the fun because you get to do it again. I often found myself building a strong base only to toy with my enemies before i crused them. A strong 7/10"
"5/5  Classic RTS that has countless spinoffs like Rise of Nations which is also ace so you know this one is good.  Soundtrack is one of my favorite vidya soundtracks period.  I remember when I was in grade 2 and 3 I'd come over to my Lebanese friend's house at like 6am and his dad would already be up and let me in to play AoE 2 until my friend woke up, serious brostatus.  "
"I don't really like the HD part of this, however I do like that I paid 20 euros for a game I've owned for many years, just so I could play it online again with friends... You sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.   But at least only very few things changed, so I guess I can live with a 500 population cap."
great game and great age to play in if youlike medieval times
I love this game
This game made my ♥♥♥♥ bleed rainbows. But ♥♥♥♥ me those AI are insane.
"Great game, I remember when I was a kid playing this with the family.. Me, my mom, my sister, and my brother, all on different computers playing versus each other, great time.. I'm just glad I can play it again! I get some rediculous, unplayable lag when I set the map size to the max and population to 500, but that's about the only problem I have with this awesome game!  10/10  If you have the money, get it, you wont regret it."
"Fun game, will lag quite a bit due to an outdated engine and horrible optimization with the new screen format and updates. It's being worked on, though."
One of the most fun RTS experiences on Steam (if you have some friends to play it with). Definately worth a buy.  9/10
grew up watching my dad play this and this is one of my favourite games on here so far!
Great classic game refreshed and release to show the gamers of today one of the big time game changers for the RTS genre!
"It's AoE:2, but higher res. There's not much more to be said."
OMG ITS SOO COOL!
Consumed my teenage years. Amazing RTS 10/10
10/10 would fight the enemy again!
"Positively sublime game; scratches the nostalgia itch but also a fantastic experience for newcomers. I'm really happy to see an HD, Steam-supported version. Makes multiplayer a breeze. If you see this game on sale and you don't have it yet, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to ignore it. I have nothing negative I could possibly say about this game. Pitch-perfect."
"Great game that I played as a kid, now it's on steam and i bought it again"
"Love the game, it is a must buy. The only thing that i would change is more nations to spice things up"
"Probably the best title this company has ever released. It's a fun, intense and strategic game. It brings every perspective you need to make a good RTS to the table. I have only been playing private pre made matches with bots for hours and it is still fun. I highly recommend playing the campaign and against friends 9/10"
"This Game will not run, Keeps crashing,"
Awesome. other than the people that have 1500 - elo but play like a 2000
"They didn't do crap to update the engine. Games will consistently disconnect, don't buy."
My first true love is back! &lt;3
"One of the best in history of games. Perfect for lan partys, even if a game lasts a whole night."
"Old classic is reborn. I loved this game as a kid, and having it on steam is awesome. The developers are still working a few bugs. Most of the credit goes to Ensemble Studios for the origional design."
An all-time classic now in HD for all your war desires
The #1 Best RTS I've Ever Played!
"First game I ever owned on a CD instead of a floppy disc. Putting hundreds of hours into this remake now to play competitively. Good community, ive got new friends ive played games with every week for the last 3 months, with new people weekly. My number 1 game of all time, best bang for your buck if you like rts"
"A classic game thrives again, with Steam multiplayer support and a whole new expansion adding five civs and new game modes. Plus Steam Workshop support, so you can update in-game textures, get new maps, etc. It's AoE II in the modern age!"
"i Love this game very much, really really love this game"
The ability to wage war for hundreds of years because your enemy once stole your sheep.   10/10
Wololoo! is there more to say? Go &amp; Get it
i really like his game
8^|
"THE RTS.  I played so many AoE games in the early 2000's on dial up, my dad thought I was an addict.  I love this game. AoE III killed the series, but AoE II still lives on and is updated to this day!   How many other RTS's can say that?  This is by far one of the best RTS games of all time. Buy it. Now."
"After many attempts, the game runs at very high CPU usage and low FPS. After researching I found out lots of people are having the same problem even though the game is nearly twenty (20) years old. There aren't any optimisations done to make the game run faster on modern computers. Also you can't change the game resolution from the settings, the 'HD' part of the game is only scaling of the original game's resolution. If you have a big resolution screen, things are going to be too small on the screen and the game is not playable. Solution to this is scaling the desktop's resolution. In my opinion this game is highly overpriced since there are only negative things when compared to the original aoe2. Things would be different if the HD version ran smoothly and if a preferred resotion could be set."
dis game dis game  to good rude to AUS asses using Mcdonalds wifi and swarms of sige rams dis game  dis game  is the best
"A return to possibly one of the best RTS games I have ever played. It has the same epic feel it had over 10 years ago when I first played it, if you enjoy playing RTS games this is definitely a must play, worth every penny."
"Great Game, very strategic and hard to master a certain style for a race of people because of the depth the game goes into (like strengths and weaknesses). Overall it's a well balanced game and is all based on your skill level to win the game."
"Yes, I love this game. Played the orginal years ago. So happy it is now updated and has great steam integration. The strategy genre doesn't get a whole lot of good new games and this is a breath of fresh air from the past. Just as fun and good as the original."
Kudos to Steam for intorducing this ultimate classic! Works well with all versions of Windows. :D
I liked this game back then when it first came out. I like to come back to it from time to time to play again. Making it HD was a nice touch.
I didn't even play it when it first came out and I like it.
really fun to play 420 poeteitao!!!
very great game still love it from when i use to play
Great game one of the best of all times
This is a great game for how old it is. HD never looked this good on a classic game before. Definitely recommend
A classic that is still a classic and great fun
"Age of Empires 2 is the best strategy game of all time. This is the game which has stopped me from ever getting into Civ or Total War. I've tried them, but all I can think whilst playing them is 'it's not quite AoE, is it?'. And thats all I can say for this game is that it's excellent, the HD remake is gorgeous (but I somewhat miss the more nonchalent feeling of the older graphics), and the foragers are VERY comitted to picking berries. 10/10, enjoy it!"
My first true love is back! &lt;3
Great Game! It also brings out the nostalgia from the original and makes the game even more enjoyable
Good classic game a realy fun game to play I would recomend to play also the multiplayer is realy good
only issue is it lags balls online but still really fun
"i love this game, but currently i cannot play it because it is marked unavailable on my apps list any ideas how to fix it. I can't seem to get any info from either steam or microsoft "
this game is a classic. allways a good way to play with alot of friends that dont have gaming pcs
"It's my second favorite childhood game, now with functional multiplayer, mod support, and an expansion. Would buy again.  "
"If you either didn't play Age of Empires 2 when it came out or you don't have conquerors expansion (or in my case, had color glitches), then this for you. It's the same glorious AoE2 we all know and love. However if you already have the original version of AoE2, then I would say stick with that, the HD edition is the same thing it just runs better modern monitors. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 for newcomers, and a 7 for vets (because like a stated earlier, it's practically the same thing)."
I would strongly recomend forgotten expansion to anyone who llikes Age of empires 2 hd and you can switch from the expansion to the normal game from the main menu if you want to play multiplayer with someone who only has Age Of Empires 2 HD.
Great game with a lot of fun waiting to be played
"Sure, you could download an old executable copy of the game in a few seconds, rework your DirectX drivers to properly display colors, and then mess around with IP settings with your friends until you finally get everyone to connect.  Or, you could instead buy this version with better AI and higher population caps, and have everything work with the push of a button.  As for the game, it's a classic. Tons of room for base-building, politics, control-intensive combat and base management, there are plenty of ways to play and tons of fun to be had. Buy a four-pack when it goes on sale and try it out with your friends."
Very good rts. Almost as good as Stronghold Crusader. 8.5/10
"They didn't do crap to update the engine. Games will consistently disconnect, don't buy."
"I remember playing this game when I was younger, and it is so much more fun now that I actually know what I'm doing! :D"
dis game dis game  to good rude to AUS asses using Mcdonalds wifi and swarms of sige rams dis game  dis game  is the best
""
THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTLEY AWEFUL... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone should have this game and learn it.
"The title is misleading as it isn't a HD remake, but the game itself is brilliant as ever."
"I loved this game when i was 10, and this remake bringing it back to life is great."
how do you turn this on  so satisfying playing this classic again and using the whole monitor. Plays just like the original and pretty well a perfect port/upgrade.  buy it when its on sale. full price is too much for HD.  endless replayability
"Oh my, this is a blast from the past. But in a highly enjoyable way, bringing back the glory days of CRT monitors, trackball mice, and 256/512 MB hard drives.  This game is a classic and still very much an awesome experience. I highly recommend purchasing this item if you have the means to. This game and others like it defined the RTS genre.  For those that dont know anything about this game, you can play the in-depth campaigns, which cover a number of historical periods and battles, allowing the player to get a very simplified version of what happened and what could have happened. For me though, multiplayer and skirmish are my bread and butter, and skirmish allows you to set up the game, from what civs, how big the map is, what type of map, so on and so forth. The game will begin with your town center with a few villagers and a scout. Typically you would use the scout to explore the map, finding the enemy and more resources. At the same time you have the few villagers start to collect resources, mostly wood and food at first. You would want to then pump out a few more villagers, building housing as needed, all to accelerate resourse collection. After a sizable amount has been stored and the right conditions are met, you can then advance ages, which unlocks more options for building your town and armies. Anyone that has not played this game is missing out on what I think is a crucial piece of RTS gaming history.  And if you havent figured it out yet, I really like this game. So much so that my first copy way back in CD-ROM days was burnt right through by my old computer's disc drive. Thats how much I played this game."
"Maybe i'm just a fanboy of this game, but i still highly recommend it. Even if you don't know the basics it won't take you long to learn them. The rest of the tricks will be finded in gameplay. I'm not gonna touch the 'HD Edition' this game declares to be but i'm gonna say that for what it is it deserves a beautifull 9.5/10.  This game will literally take hours and hours of worth gameplay and it's extremelly fun with friends.  Where is the .5 missing? The online, is not bad at all but if one person has lagg everyone will suffer form it. But that can be easily fixed. At full price or at discount i higly recommend Age of Empires II HD Edition with the DLC."
The game is great the tech support is a failure. Cannot play game due to server being overloaded. This has been going on for the last 2 weeks and no help.
GO BUY IT WITHOUT SECOND TOUGH
Bish ples 
"Age of Empire II is a very good and fun game. It has a bit of a learning curve as most of these games with hot keys and what not. But as far as the game itself is? its awesome! the graphics look good and having a large army that fights the AI in a bloody death battle is really fun! I can say this is a very fun game to play with friends buuuuuuuuuuut you both have you to really know what you are doing because of one of you is really good and one of you is not , the new guy will die. But this game has allot of hours you can sink into it. 7/10 learning curve :L"
good game as far as offline goes but as for online what a joke laggy as all hell and theres basically no one ever online dead game is dead
Age of Empires just like in the old days !! :) And now with online matches also
love all of the game series
The father of strategies. The best.
"Great game, It never gets old and there is always something you can improve on when playing."

"Leonardo is the biggest loser out of any of the ninja turtles, i swear to god he gives me a damn headache with his stupid pussface ♥♥♥♥ that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥"
"This game has some of the worst unit AI I have ever seen in an RTS. Attack move is the most frustrating command to give your units in this game. If you are looking for a good old classic RTS, skip this game and get StarCraft 1."
AGE IS LIKE WOAH DUDE IT REMINDS ME OF A DOUBLE RAINBOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN
Been far? Decided to Use? Look more like! Call: 985-655-2500
Good classic game a realy fun game to play I would recomend to play also the multiplayer is realy good
"My review in Haiku form.  Fanbois eveywhere Poor framerate and online stuff Devs left it broken  This has been, a review in Haiku form. Thank you."
liked the orginal game played loads of when young got the hd editoin for nostliaic reasons then got the new expsion like new civs but why half new campiens set in italy would have liked more verty in that not same part of world all the time. maybe more native american scoiners and different teyps not just charthier drivern not much village building build own army etc diferent soinciers.could never finsh holy roman campgien.like there to be more then chirsten monks native american priests and more unique units would be nice. give each civ more diferences. please frogive bad speling and that.
old days im in love  
This game is fun three stars
"What can you say really Micro♥♥♥♥♥ best game ever......trust me replay is never ending, I've been playing this since the first release it is seriously good gaming, in my top 10 easily.  I waited until on offer, I paid £2.49 as microshit is greedy and keep games overpriced for years and too lazy to fix the bugs."
"Amazing Game! I spent alot of my childhood playing this awsome game, so I really only bought the HD edition to support the devs, but still a great game. I recommend anyone who was played this game, the Age series, or similar games like civ 5 to try it out!"
not recommended
"I really want to recommend this game.. I REALLY do. But after playing it recently.. I found out how broken it became after the 'updates'. Units used to actually listen to orders, now they just get stuck on themselves. Boats dont work any more. Its a Miracle that Fishing boats and Trade Cogs work (They still glitchy when u have a fair bit though, but dont freeze on anything.) The last game I played it was a Water match. 2 players vs 2 bots vs 2 bots on standard difficulty. The AI's beat us to imperial.. But never made any move. Not even against eachother. The most the AI did was act defensively with Monks against Galleons. After I got more then 8 combat ships, they started to show signs of glitchyness. The ships got stuck on one another permenently and I had to kill one to free the other, they didnt attack anything at all, they froze in movement with more then 7 units in one grouping. Even when I attacked one AI's island, and they had British longbowmen moving about.. None of them shot at me. The only thing that attacked back was its castle. I love this game and games like it (Age of empires 3 sucked and so did Age of Myth. I dont like their feel and how they limit the gameplay capabilities.) but right now the games glitchyness... makes me cringe.   7.8/10 - Rating  Will play, but cant recommend to someone who wants a strategy game that doesnt bug like crazy. If you want one then try out Starcraft or Warcraft 3 (Not World of Warcraft, that game died a while ago = /)"
This is one of my first games i played on steam i played it with my brother and best friend i was never good but it was always fun. if you like RTS games this is a game you want to buy! i also recommend getting the third one if you do not have it aswell as this.
"Age of Empires II the Forgotten single player campaign game may just be some of the absolute BEST RTS games with detailed maps, amazing challengs, and enough gameplay types to keep all the games fresh. Strongly recommend for the single player alone."
The game that got me into PC gaming. Speaks for itself.
Wow.... I played this for the first time in 2015. Oh how I wish I would have played it back in 1999 when it first came out!  It's wonderful!
Still waiting for it to be released in stunning 480p
GO BUY IT WITHOUT SECOND TOUGH
"getting really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of now, i start a game fine and then it freezes my entire pc, resulting in me to hard reset why is this happening, i have 16gb ram, 4690k i5, and asus strix 1070, all my other games are fine to play, its getting on my nerves now"
I expected more for a remake or offical HD version. (I have also the old AoE2)  - very bad AI with more thane one player - the new balancing is ♥♥♥♥ - the Multiplayer runns very bad behind NAT-Players - No new '3D' Units like from 'Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds' (same Engine)  This is only a small texturepack and not a real remake!
Like CIV but faster and more fighting-based.
10/10
One of the greatest games ever made.
Not even nostalgia can make this game good.
Great
"Age of Empires 2 HD edition brings High Definition to arguably the best strategy game of all time. For a fan like myself, this brings back childhood memories and I was very excited for its release. First of all, there have not been that many changes to the game. Apart from the food, wood, stone and gold icons and the fire image there are no noticeable changes. What I say is don not fix something that is not broken and it seems that the changes that would have been made which did not make any changes in reality. The A.I is no different from the original game, which honestly I would have liked a little tweaking, they are still find ways of getting trapped on bridges and in woods. This should have been fixed. Expansion aside, the HD edition brings no new features to the game (no new civilisations or maps or campaigns). Again I would have liked new features to this classic game, the HD edition by itself does feel quite outdated but then again in RTS, that is not necessarily a bad thing. RTS has not really changed since AoE2 was released. The price of £15 is a major rip-off and is the biggest reason why not many people have bought this HD re-master.  Pros - Classic game re-mastered in HD - Steam servers for online playability (which the original had major problems with) - Ability to save a game online and then come back to it is another great feature. - No compatibility issues  Cons - Little difference between the original and the HD version  o Same A.I problems  o Textures have not make a noticeable difference  o Same nations and campaign  Rating 7/10  The expansion for the HD Edition is what the AoE2 game was crying for. The forgotten is an excellent expansion to the game and adds features which should have been there is the HD edition. There are new nations, extra features, better textures, new campaign and even more fixes to the game. For me this expansion should never have been there it should have been included in the HD edition but both of them together makes a huge difference to the game and the classic game feels re-mastered and up to date yet still retains the core gameplay that made the game so appealing in the first place. When boths games were 75% off about £7 total price, I felt that this price tag is what the actual price shouls have been, £22 is too much for a remaster of a play no matter how good it was.  Rating 8/10"
"If you didn't play this game when you were a little piece of momy and daddy's love, then you deserve to be murdered by psycho bananas, inside a soundproof, transparent cage in front of the whole school so the cool kids can laugh at you.   "
Simply... Nostalgia
bejeweled clone
"My childhood is all about this game, huhu, it makes me cry :((("
"Though not the HD edition (obviously) I grew up with this game. amazing stories, well made strategy game!"
"Maybe i'm just a fanboy of this game, but i still highly recommend it. Even if you don't know the basics it won't take you long to learn them. The rest of the tricks will be finded in gameplay. I'm not gonna touch the 'HD Edition' this game declares to be but i'm gonna say that for what it is it deserves a beautifull 9.5/10.  This game will literally take hours and hours of worth gameplay and it's extremelly fun with friends.  Where is the .5 missing? The online, is not bad at all but if one person has lagg everyone will suffer form it. But that can be easily fixed. At full price or at discount i higly recommend Age of Empires II HD Edition with the DLC."
Second best game :) (one love sc2)
"I'm surprisingly let down, what was great years ago is now clunky. I honestly wanted to fall in love with this game again but it didn't happen. They should have done a lot more work, if you have the original version play that, there really isn't much of a differnce. Sadly I can't reccommned."
"Game is my childhood. Buy it, but only play with friends in LAN: online multiplayer quality sucks. Apart from that?  Best ♥♥♥♥in' RTS in the WORLD, buy it and buy copies for your friends. Wait for it to be 75% off tho."
10/10
one of the best Strategy ever ! Worth it &lt;3
Nice HD remake of the old Age of Empires II. The best things in the game are the new AI (more challenging than the original) and the multiplayer.
horrible. they are just useing this title to cash in on the fans for $$$ big mistake on buying it with bogus quick money grab dlcs that kill the workshop almost makeing you buy every dlc to stay updated.
"Its like Age of Empires 2, but HD. You get what your asking for, the best rts from your childhood with functioning multiplayer and an extra expansion pack. Also the graphics are slightly less mind bogglingly nineties. Overall if you played the origional 9/10, if you didnt 9/10."
"The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing."
"15Fps, lags on a average system. Buggy game."
I play this game since I was a kid and now I have a chance to play again.. However.. just warning. Community is toxic af and I dont recommend to play this game online.  This game is great.. The community players sucks .  
ELITE MANGUDAI SPAM INTENSIFIES
I hate France so much
"Could be better without bugs. Tried to host game 2 times.. First time it just crashed for no reason, second time, out of sync error eccorured. I have decent PC/connection."
"Classic AoE II in HD edition, what else do you want?!"
A genre defining game. Easily the best of it's kind and with the versatility of Garry's Mod when it comes to player created worlds and mods.
one of my top favored games of all times but horrible Remastered edition seriously. this game is 2013 and has 2 second delay on every action in multiplayer and even lan. not even my old computer back in 2000 lagged this hard when playing on voobly/gameranger/Lan. how can this even be sold withouth fixing simple problems like lag/delay? btw i have a supercomputer so the problem is not on my end. very dissapointed and can't recommend to anyone
"Absolutely love this game; however, it crashes incessantly which really is getting to me. If this gets fixed, it'll be my best game purchase on steam"
"I have played this game for over 10 years now, love it!"
I hope they fix the bugs and crashes soon.
Well over 15 years old and it's still a masterpiece 10/10
"Prefer the first age of empires game, but this will do."
"Takes some practice, get good and don't play the Huns you ♥♥♥♥in plebs. #♥♥♥♥ThyHuns"
Great game. Cannot figure out though how to play vs AI with resources on zero. Always seems to start at 10k everything..? AOE3 is better otherwise.
"This Dracula campaign is the most absurd thing I have ever seen. To beat it you just need to save and load, then AI will become dumb and glitch every second. Otherwise prepare yourself to infinite waves of enemies, because AI is given unlimited resources and will produce units nonstop. Those who made this campaign are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."
"My Childhood is back, but taking off the nostalgia goggles off: is this game worth it?  TL;DR? Yes.  (Click Read More for a more detailed review.)      Pros and Cons:  + Great blend of games like Starcraft and Civilisation. + Graphics aged well. + Campaign for people who like story and Sandbox for people like me who just wanna play. - AI can hurr durr at times - Poorly optimised, but gradually being patched - not recommended on pre-2012 computers.  Notes:  AoE II is a superb game worth your time and money. From the nomadic times, all the way to the Post-Imperial age: you will see your choice of Civilisation through it (or be destroyed horribly). AoE's blend of many different RTS (and strategy for that matter) games will engage you for many playthroughs, whether you like the thoughtfulness of Civilisation 5 or the action of Starcraft: AoE has something for you. However, it is very poorly optimised and the AI can be a dunce on occassion - but fairly rairly.   Verdict:  8.5/10"
"The Good: If you really liked AoE2 a decade ago you will probably still like it. :D  The Bad: If you are playing on an HDTV, high resolution monitor or require any kind of visual assistance (it is completely lacking accessibility options) I cannot recommend this game. The UI and text are extremely small on high resolutions and it does not have the ability to zoom in so everything is just too small. :("
"old game, same fun, this game is a MUST in your library "
"i love this game so much when i was a kid that i was running to the computer room so excited to play this , jumped and hit my knee on the side of the wall and ended up with a broken knee so i didnt have to go to school :) , would break my knees again to play AOEII"
Best game of the AoE series
"A true RTS with great game mechanics, accurate historical elements and simply epic soundtrack"
"Its fun and addicting, but it'll be more fun if you have friends to play with you."
Not great value for money when you consider all that this adds to the original was available freely as mods. Would still have given a positive rating if it weren't for the netcode being complete ♥♥♥♥.
"i love this game so much when i was a kid that i was running to the computer room so excited to play this , jumped and hit my knee on the side of the wall and ended up with a broken knee so i didnt have to go to school :) , would break my knees again to play AOEII"
"Its fun and addicting, but it'll be more fun if you have friends to play with you."
"It's Age of Empires 2, with Steamworks, and Achievements, and ease of use, and no MSN Zone"
"I bought the game and after a while I discovered that the game is not HD, The solution?"
i can't play because of this product key help please? 
"Sadly this game will no longer start up whenever i try to play it. Hoping they will fix this, a fun game but currently broken "
"This game was probably the first strategy game I've ever played and I remembered that I used to be  good  at this game.  However, this game hasn't aged that well for one simple thing: a pause button. With almost 15 years since I last played this, RTS strategy games have moved on to implement this simple feature. It's like playing old shooters without automatic healing, arguably it makes everything less challenging, but for an RTS, it makes micromanaging a bit of a living hell as you are restricted to one playstyle and that is  rush everything!   Regardless of that fact though, it's still a very solid game with countless of hours of gameplay and it's one other reliable timesink for all of you who seem to think you have unlimited time on Earth. Just expect a very simple mechanics that is probably geared towards war more than economy or diplomacy. If you're looking to micromanage huge Empires, there are other games that have done it better since then in many ways such as Civilization series, Paradox games such as Europa Universalis and Victoria II, or the Total War series. Age of Empires II is probably very limited to strictly nostalgia or multiplayer games in today's plentiful RTS games."
great strategy game......play more and discover more and more never ending interest
"I bought the game and thought that there weren't many graphical differences to the game, but when one of my soldiers stabbed a farm. Oh god. That ♥♥♥♥ing fire. That's the most ♥♥♥♥ing HD fire effect i have ever seen in my entire life.  Praise the HD Love the HD"
Not great value for money when you consider all that this adds to the original was available freely as mods. Would still have given a positive rating if it weren't for the netcode being complete ♥♥♥♥.
"It's Age of Empires 2, with Steamworks, and Achievements, and ease of use, and no MSN Zone"
Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings in High Definition.
OVERLOAD OF EPICNESS. TYPING IN CAPS TO EMPHASIZE HOW ADRENALINE-INDUCING THIS GAME IS. DON'T EVEN PUT AN EXCLAMATION MARK AFTER ALL THESE SENTENCES BECAUSE A DOT GIVES MORE OF A STATEMENT.
"Really love what they have done with the new expansion, makes this classic very fresh and allows for people to see it and possibly try for the first time i have been playing this game since i can remember and will continue for many years"
its not as fun as i thought and i wasted 16 and i cant refund it 
Great ♥♥♥♥in' Game
Yes... Yes I do recommend the game that I grew up with in my child hood.
Brings back so many memories!
i played vs a guy that was playing his first game so i put tons of wall all over his base and he was like uh is this normal hahaha 2 sec after he ragequited
I've always been a fan of Age of Empires. It's the game that got me into gaming. Love to see this on steam. Steam Workshop makes it even better.
Think of it like the ♥♥♥♥ the chick takes in your favourite porno. She Loves It! Also this is a good game.
"Do you have fond memories of playing this when you were younger? If so i can 100% recommend this game, HOWEVER if you have never played this game i STILL recommend it 9/10"
"Love this game, it's like a fine wine, as it gets older it just keeps getting better and better. :-)"
"Was promised giant map, got ludaKRIS lag. 11/10 would lose army by having them walk into the enemy army.  Was promised new ai, new ai lets their villagers die to light calvery 10/10 ai's would let you roll over their base in the first age."
Very fun fantasy game. Strengthen your strategy. meh 8/10
"High school LAN parties wih pirated AOE2. Good old days. But now finally bought this steam edition as an 8 user pack and with me and my friends working in different places all over the country we can play using steam servers and continue with the fun. No hastle like those school days. Just sit and play and now with better graphics too. Highly recommended.  Last played on: GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 820M DDR3 CPU: Intel Core i5-5200U @ 2.20GHz RAM: 4GB DDR3 Game Resolution: 1366x768, 60Hz Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 64bit Home Controller: Mouse and Keyboard"
"What's good? It's age of empires 2... well, mostly.  How did it ♥♥♥♥ the bed? Well...  - Cannot change resolution. It's stuck on a big resolution that makes units feel a bit smaller. No reason why. It's missing a very basic thing that most games should have. The options actually feel scaled down from the original, which was a game made in 1999. Pretty sad, but this isn't the biggest let down for me.  - You can't import save files from the 1999 version. If you try to load them, the game crashes. Which is fine - there may be a way to do this, but I'm at a loss.  - Scroll speed feels more finicky, and takes some messing with to get used to.  The good of it...  - You can do windowed mode, which didn't exist in the original. Windowed mode also lets you 'clamp mouse to window', which stops mouse-going-out-of-window hijinks from happening. The latter feature was something age of empires 3 didn't have either, so this, as you can see, is a big improvement.   - Speed setting feels as fast as Age of Kings. The Conquerors (the original AoE2 expansion), had sluggish speed settings, even when playing fastest. I always like to play on faster or fastest speeds to get my brain going, so I like this.   Still sluggish in a way that taxes response time in online play with 4 players or more.   Nitpicks...  - The crops of the farms are now yellow. Apparently, all farms are corn or wheat. Pointless deviation from the classic, which didn't seem necessary.  - You can't save replays.  - Pop limit increased to 500. While cool, villager limit should be 100.  - There needs to a be game set up option to cap ages. Right now the strategy is always a variation of 'get trebuchets/protect trebuchets'. Give noobs the chance to win in the castle age with mangonels, knights, archers and rams! Dark age with militia cheese!   This is what I wanted out of Age of Empires 3 (and I don't think they delivered then, either).  - Graphics don't feel different from the original, like, at all really - until you see things like burning buildings, probably water, projectiles (cannon balls, arrows, etc.), and the farms.  Overall - 7/10. You can ignore the nitpicks (except the pop and age cap thing). It replaces the original in just about every respect. Though it definitely needs some additional patching before it can be made a perfect remake. If it didn't have online though, it'd probably only get a 5/10, so be warned."
Lack of linux support is shameful

"Completely useless. AI in single player is non-existant, multiplayer is hard to get working. Save your money and buy the original version if you need an AoE fix."
Watched my workers die farming while being pelted by spears  10/10 would recommend
Best strategy game ever made. As timeless as 'chess'.  Thank you for bringing it to steam! You guys are my heroes.
Recommended!!!
Lots of fun. I enjoy building way too many walls and then cringing as the enemy breaks easily through them. 'HD' is kind of a lie but all the gameplay's still there and good as ever.
even better than aoe 3
"Immersion is the word.  Back when AoE II was launched, and graphics were not at their peak, the game creators did everything in their hands to add up a little extra of immersion, wherever they could find it.   The stories were great and true, the surrounding sound, the sound armies did, everything was done to enhance that little bit of magic that the graphics left out.   Well. That was twenty years ago. Now, in 2015, in an era where graphics cards can differentiate between hair strings, what can we do to enhance the immersion while bringing something new to AoE's universe ?  Why, says the current team, let's just bring all the graphics to HD. All the players wanted was to play it at 1080 x 800 back then, and guess what! Now we can play it at 1980x1280!   Ok, so what else? We can bring new civilizations! ... Nah, leave it at DLC's. "
"I have like 20 minutes played, so ... ummm ... it's ok :S"
  This game is bloody amazing
Reminds me of the time I used to get my dad to write in the cheat codes because I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and put like 1000 spaces inbetween the words because it looked too small.
great game. great multiplayer fun.
11/10 would bang
really fun
"My favorite strategy game. Amazing playability, balance, and feel. Age of empires is the heart of my strategy gaming world. I do like the Total war series, but they lack the heart offered by Age of Empires. I can spend hours playing this, and creating scenarios. The AI might not be the worlds best, but it is an awesome game for it's time, and a not to miss gaming experience. 10/10"
"  I Classic. One of the best, i used to play this game a whole bunch back in the day but recently got it gifted to me by my bro on steam and i thank him to infinity.  Worth it."
"Awesome remake, works really well and if you are a fan of the first two AOE games this is perfect for you. Had a ton of fun and will return again in a few years, replay value isnt super high but the core RTS is still great"
this game was my childhood 10/10
"This game. It is one of many games on steam, but this game reminds me of my childhood. I would spend hows playing this game as young lad. It is worth the wieght if you enjoy RTS type games. Beware of the Meh multiplayer, sometimes it can be shaky but ok."
one of the best rts of all time.
"A classic game that I've loved since childhood, everyone should play it at least once! Wololo!"
its alright but i prefer MemeItUp: Chronicals
"I played Age of Empires II extensively back when it was released in 1999 along with every game in the Age of Empires franchise before and after. Age of Empires II is the high water mark for the series and arguably the best overall RTS game of all time. It combines excellent design with solid art direction. The single player campaigns are fun and varied and multiplier is still fun to this day. This is one of the easier RTS titles in which to create your own map and I have made everything from the Great Lakes area of the United States to a large scale map of Middle Earth. Overall you can not go wrong with this purchase, especially for the low price that it is offered for on Steam.  Positives +Excellent graphics for its time, although they look dated now +Management of economy units was still important back in 1999 and you win this game with villagers, not with trebuchets.  +Huge maps and many valid play styles.   Negatives -Dated graphics.  Overall 9/10  At time of initial release (1999) 10/10"
I remember atempting to play this game at 6 years old while my older cousins were frusrtated with me doing absolutely terrible.  I remember playing this game at 9 years old in my elementary school library.  I remember playing this game at 10 years old when I discovered that there are cheat codes and spamming Robin Hood.  I remember playing this game at 12 creating my own scenarios.  I remember playing this game at 16 when I found out I had other friends who played this as a child and we had essentially acomplished the LAN party.  I remember playing this yesterday when I got whooped by a Viking computer on hardest on an Island map.
"The game that started the collection... Age of Empires!  When whoring resources or walling out the gold from you 'Ally' many, many hours are guaranteed to torture your realm and ambush your enemies and leave your allies locked outside your gates whilst they run away from impending doom... Oh wait no that was me, at my allies gates running away from the 2nd coming!!!   Or perhaps role in with 300 Hun horses backed by sige equipment and play wipeout!   11/10 Would Blame it on your ISP again!"
"Played with three other friends , got destroyed because they thought they would get food for killing me. 10/10 would play again"
classic game and totally worth the money
I changed the world with a sheep  10/10
"Not that many servers available currently. Just a few dozens of servers... And people are complaining about Out-of-Sync issues everywhere. Still... I got it for less than 5€ (AoE2+Conq), so I can't complain. The 'HD' merely beefs up the resolution which you can't change in the settings btw. Nothing more. Oh yea and there's an Attack-Move finally!"
"Age of Empires 2 HD edition brings High Definition to arguably the best strategy game of all time. For a fan like myself, this brings back childhood memories and I was very excited for its release. First of all, there have not been that many changes to the game. Apart from the food, wood, stone and gold icons and the fire image there are no noticeable changes. What I say is don not fix something that is not broken and it seems that the changes that would have been made which did not make any changes in reality. The A.I is no different from the original game, which honestly I would have liked a little tweaking, they are still find ways of getting trapped on bridges and in woods. This should have been fixed. Expansion aside, the HD edition brings no new features to the game (no new civilisations or maps or campaigns). Again I would have liked new features to this classic game, the HD edition by itself does feel quite outdated but then again in RTS, that is not necessarily a bad thing. RTS has not really changed since AoE2 was released. The price of £15 is a major rip-off and is the biggest reason why not many people have bought this HD re-master.  Pros - Classic game re-mastered in HD - Steam servers for online playability (which the original had major problems with) - Ability to save a game online and then come back to it is another great feature. - No compatibility issues  Cons - Little difference between the original and the HD version  o Same A.I problems  o Textures have not make a noticeable difference  o Same nations and campaign  Rating 7/10  The expansion for the HD Edition is what the AoE2 game was crying for. The forgotten is an excellent expansion to the game and adds features which should have been there is the HD edition. There are new nations, extra features, better textures, new campaign and even more fixes to the game. For me this expansion should never have been there it should have been included in the HD edition but both of them together makes a huge difference to the game and the classic game feels re-mastered and up to date yet still retains the core gameplay that made the game so appealing in the first place. When boths games were 75% off about £7 total price, I felt that this price tag is what the actual price shouls have been, £22 is too much for a remaster of a play no matter how good it was.  Rating 8/10"

THIS IS THE ♥♥♥♥!!!
Always loved it still do (but not with rob -. -...) 10.5/10 c:
old days im in love  
"Amazing Game! I spent alot of my childhood playing this awsome game, so I really only bought the HD edition to support the devs, but still a great game. I recommend anyone who was played this game, the Age series, or similar games like civ 5 to try it out!"
"I really want to recommend this game.. I REALLY do. But after playing it recently.. I found out how broken it became after the 'updates'. Units used to actually listen to orders, now they just get stuck on themselves. Boats dont work any more. Its a Miracle that Fishing boats and Trade Cogs work (They still glitchy when u have a fair bit though, but dont freeze on anything.) The last game I played it was a Water match. 2 players vs 2 bots vs 2 bots on standard difficulty. The AI's beat us to imperial.. But never made any move. Not even against eachother. The most the AI did was act defensively with Monks against Galleons. After I got more then 8 combat ships, they started to show signs of glitchyness. The ships got stuck on one another permenently and I had to kill one to free the other, they didnt attack anything at all, they froze in movement with more then 7 units in one grouping. Even when I attacked one AI's island, and they had British longbowmen moving about.. None of them shot at me. The only thing that attacked back was its castle. I love this game and games like it (Age of empires 3 sucked and so did Age of Myth. I dont like their feel and how they limit the gameplay capabilities.) but right now the games glitchyness... makes me cringe.   7.8/10 - Rating  Will play, but cant recommend to someone who wants a strategy game that doesnt bug like crazy. If you want one then try out Starcraft or Warcraft 3 (Not World of Warcraft, that game died a while ago = /)"
"Simply put, if you loved Age of Empires 2, you will love this game. Same great RTS with integrated Steam Multi-player. No more MSN Gamezone! Also, if you plan on picking this up looking into AOE2 HD: The Forgotten. It breathes new life into the game with new civiliations, and gametypes.  Love it, buy it!"
I attacked my friend with an army of sheep.      I didnt win that game. 10/10
"Multiplayer is unacceptably laggy, and the omnipresent 'out of sync detected' makes it unplayable. The multiplayer restore function is broken. Given that multiplayer is the only reason most of us are even playing this game, I can't recommend it until these problems are fixed."
"Love the game, Hate the players.  to those who insist on staying in the lobby saying 'I'LL GET IT FIXED PROMISE': ♥♥♥ you"
I'm being rushed!
I can only speak in AOE Taunts now. 100% worth it.
made an aztec army and saved tenochitlan 10/10 would change history again
I changed the world with a sheep  10/10
5/5
good game as far as offline goes but as for online what a joke laggy as all hell and theres basically no one ever online dead game is dead
"Age of Empire II is a very good and fun game. It has a bit of a learning curve as most of these games with hot keys and what not. But as far as the game itself is? its awesome! the graphics look good and having a large army that fights the AI in a bloody death battle is really fun! I can say this is a very fun game to play with friends buuuuuuuuuuut you both have you to really know what you are doing because of one of you is really good and one of you is not , the new guy will die. But this game has allot of hours you can sink into it. 7/10 learning curve :L"
Age of Empires just like in the old days !! :) And now with online matches also
"This is a great game for singleplayer but, personally, I do not find that as enjoyable as multiplayer.  The networking code behind the game is a mess. As such it makes it extremely difficult to play multiplayer games. There is constant freezing and disconnection causing interruption to the game.  I would suggest that it is OK to play singleplayer but I would not recommened buying the game in hopes of playing multiplayer."
love all of the game series
A blast from the past!
bejeweled clone
Simply... Nostalgia
"My childhood is all about this game, huhu, it makes me cry :((("
"What can you say really Micro♥♥♥♥♥ best game ever......trust me replay is never ending, I've been playing this since the first release it is seriously good gaming, in my top 10 easily.  I waited until on offer, I paid £2.49 as microshit is greedy and keep games overpriced for years and too lazy to fix the bugs."
"Cannot recommend until they fix their bugs and synch issues. Over 20 patches and a new expansion later-- the bugs are even worse. AI has no response sometimes, heck even campaigns are not all possible to beat. The devs acknowledge but so far no fix. And multiplayer has always had and has lag issues. Still if you are a diehard fan you will find enjoyment in some games, just know that the status as of right now is not recommendable.  8/10  The game is a classic 'redone' with slightly better graphics. Just as fun as it was basically a decade ago and now with a fresh expansion. The music aint too bad either. So find some friends and play this real time strategy masterpiece, either versus eachother or teamed against programmed bots. AOEIIHD will quench that early 2000's nostalgia, somewhat."
This game is fun three stars
"I must 100% agree with the Totalitarian above me. In fact he is one of my friends from school. He is quite good, but he lacks a quality castle age rush-- which I consider my best time period. Thank you for your time. Have a great afternoon!"
"Was promised giant map, got ludaKRIS lag. 11/10 would lose army by having them walk into the enemy army.  Was promised new ai, new ai lets their villagers die to light calvery 10/10 ai's would let you roll over their base in the first age."
Very fun fantasy game. Strengthen your strategy. meh 8/10
The best game ever made.
"Dont believe the metascore, this game is a spectacular classic, the reviews are people whining they paid $20 for something so old. But to be honest, it's still not washed up and the game is super fun in multiplayer."
Go get the ♥♥♥ game and make sure you have friends to play with. This game is better than drungs and sex.
Lack of linux support is shameful
"If you didn't play this game when you were a little piece of momy and daddy's love, then you deserve to be murdered by psycho bananas, inside a soundproof, transparent cage in front of the whole school so the cool kids can laugh at you.   "
i luv when i RekT all Da 0thr emPires Thx ensemble  
"Not that I feel I have to recommend this game, but I will anyway. Age of Empires II was legendary for good reason. It set a lot of precedents that are now commonplace in the Real-Time strategy genre and while this HD remastering isn't very impressive and changes a few unnecessary things from the original games, those changes can be negated by the stellar Steam Workshop support."
This is one of my first games i played on steam i played it with my brother and best friend i was never good but it was always fun. if you like RTS games this is a game you want to buy! i also recommend getting the third one if you do not have it aswell as this.
Not even nostalgia can make this game good.
Always loved it still do (but not with rob -. -...) 10.5/10 c:
a great version of the original
AOE 2:  Use a villager to build Lose the villager Make a new one Find that villager that you lost 2 hours later.  11/9      One of my favorite games of all time. I had it on disc but I decided to get it on Steam. Buy it.
"Not ♥♥♥♥ing HD at all, I feel completely ripped off. All they've added is widescreen and high resolution support but the graphics have NOT been updated at all. This update should have been a free patch to original owners of the game, at best."
Nice game
"Lots of people are giving this game negative reviews because they are saying that this is exactly the same as the original. However, I am going to judge this as a separate game. The gameplay itself is extremely good, and the graphics are fine. The steam workshop support is nice. There's only a few bugs."
"Oh goodness this game, it was on sale and me and some friends bought it (one of which played starwars battlegrounds) and we all loved it. Whether i'm playing singleplayer or raiding my friends if your a fan of strategy and betrayal this is the game for you."
"It's Age of ♥♥♥♥ing Awesome II, but in HD, with steam-integrated online multiplayer and bug fixes. And compatability fixes. I beat my old roommate at this game once and he got really hissypissy that I adapted to his strategies.  WOLOLO"
"Buy this while it's on sale, you will NOT regret it. I also suggest number 3"
"I've loved this game since it came out, Now in HD it gives a whole new Reason to play. Multiplayer matches, along with new hd textures. Great Game!"
Cool game.
5/5 pretty good.
Converted enemy armies with hundreds of monks.  10/10 would wololo again.
Played the classic game when i was 7. And it got quite good improvements. Definitely worth the money. :)
Great ♥♥♥♥in' Game
Fun and very nice game .... But unplayable on 4K monitor :(
  This game is bloody amazing
"The best of RTS, a classic! Love it"
Great Game
You can never go wrong with nostalgia.
  It's very laggy in Window 10. Only playable in window 7
great game
"This is the game of my childhood. Watching my father play, raising civilizations from scratch, just makes me relieve all the good times. What I noticed in the game now and didn’t see ten years back is that every nation’s units speak differently. If the unit is British, he would speak English, if he is Teuton, he would speak German. Also, I like both expansions – first gave us new style in buildings (aztec style), second gave us even more new styles – italian and slavic. It is really pleasant to see something added to such an old game, something that feels right and not as some addon. Totally recommend the game! "
Not enough water.

Awesome RTS game one of the classics.

"Nice Strategy Game.Very well done and thought of with nice features and naval warfare included.But games might take a long while to finish, so be warned, beacause long games aren't everybodies picnic, but if you don't mind, this game is really good and fast paced, good micro and macro requirements to play at both casual and competitive levels."
great game. HD is very impressive compared to the first version 
"What other game can I spend 3 hours building a civilization of eagle and jaguar warriors only to have them be mangudai'd to hell in seconds, and now in 'HD'?  This game is only fun at 3 in the morning/10"

And now you published the ♥♥♥♥ as a game in HD. I would call it Age Of Empires II HD ♥♥♥♥ edition.   This game is slightly amazing.  The ♥♥♥♥ slided from my ♥♥♥ some good i had a amazing pain.   DO YOU LIKE THAT? DO YOU LIKE THAT?"
ITS ABOUT ♥♥♥♥ING TIME THEY HAVE AOE ON STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOOOOOW
"Very good game, you all must buy it... NOW"
the game is great but not realy the ai sometimes it only builds priests and settlers but when it works the game is as good as it was before
"Never played the game, friend convinced me to get it. Sooo much fun playing with friends "
"A good remake on a old game that I still enjoy to play. For anyone that enjoyed Age of Empires II, you will certainly enjoy this game."
if you enjoy rts games   ♥♥♥♥ing  buy the ♥♥♥♥ out of this
do you like stratigy games like civ or any other phone game ex: grepolis well you can actuly use stratigy in this game!!!! build your buildings were you want build what units you want move individual units better your gear build your village city kingdome EMPIER? or become a band of roving bandets and have your light calvery destroy the eniemy with hit and run charge a group of unsuspecting man at arms with heavycalvery or black out the sun with arrows from your longbowmen get this game are you still reading this wtf is wrong with you get the bloody game

great strategy game......play more and discover more and more never ending interest
"This game still holds up even though it's older than I am, and still being given DLC to keep things fresh"
"A super fun game! If you happen to like RTS games this is one I would highly recommend, assuming you like the art style. The campain and even single player battles are fun and you often have to think in order to win the battle. It can be a little hard to get used to at first but once your used to it you'll have lots of fun from the game for quite a long time. From the campain to the single mission battles, you'll have a blast."
Great Game!

"Grew up playing Rise of Nations, but my friend introduced me into this game and I got hooked. Another impulse buy, ALL HAIL GABEN, haven't played it much, but mostly because there as many good RTS'. I'll get around to this game someday, and I can't wait till I do. The strategy in this game is huge, especially if you get into this game. There is good pros and cons to each country and this makes the replayability of this game huge."
Yes... Yes I do recommend the game that I grew up with in my child hood.
Best strategy game ever made. As timeless as 'chess'.  Thank you for bringing it to steam! You guys are my heroes.
Recommended!!!
Lots of fun. I enjoy building way too many walls and then cringing as the enemy breaks easily through them. 'HD' is kind of a lie but all the gameplay's still there and good as ever.
AOE 2:  Use a villager to build Lose the villager Make a new one Find that villager that you lost 2 hours later.  11/9      One of my favorite games of all time. I had it on disc but I decided to get it on Steam. Buy it.
"Not ♥♥♥♥ing HD at all, I feel completely ripped off. All they've added is widescreen and high resolution support but the graphics have NOT been updated at all. This update should have been a free patch to original owners of the game, at best."
"Play match with my little brother, the map is islands. proceed to fill entire sea max population galleons. This expansion has been too funny."
Soldiers and villagers need food.  Monks only need gold  10/10
5/5 would recommend
a great version of the original
Its aoe2 but with new water even tho the grass still looks dumb so i dunno but its updated so buy it k and dont forget forgotten empires. watch out for lag and mexicans
It's p dece a
"Still great RTS game, even on these days. If you find yourself of having difficulties trying to play the original version on your modern machine, then check out the HD Edition. It provides many new features and enhancements, while still retaining the original gameplay, just like back in the original release date. And best of all, you don't have to worry about the compatibility, as it's designed to be working on the modern computers. Definitely worth it, if you're fan of RTS games."
"It had a rough and buggy launch, nearly decried as a flop, but by god did Microsoft turn it all around and fix a slew of game breaking issues in record time. With that rapid recovery came a slew of new features, an immense collection of useful mods and entertaining campaigns through the Steam Workshop, and even an all new expansion that doesn't disappoint. Today, AOEII HD is a great nostalgia-fest from which I had a terrible time breaking free. It's every bit as amazing as the classic AOEII experience, if not better. It was a preorder I did not regret, a title I have no qualms about recommending, and a gift I've taken pride in giving. I could not recommend AOEII HD more.  Update: We're now two expansions in, the game is still being patched frequently, all of the bugs and performance issues have been patched out of existence, and players are still enjoying it. It's safe to say this is an example of an HD remaster done right."

"I've loved this game ever since I was a kid, this was basically my childhood. I still think that it is the best RTS ever made (other than StarCraft obviously)"
It's a really cool war game if you're winning.
It's really really good eventho there is some lag with the multiplayer :D
I loved this game ever since I was a child. That's all I really have to say.
"Fantastic Game, its a joy to play a Classic."
Best RTS in my childhood. Have to play it until i die.
5/7
I spent my childhood with this masterpeice
I have no words for this game Literally the greatest game i've ever played in my life
Just like the good old days
Old but gold

fix the netcode make the bots more ballanced PHEWUD PLEASE
"It's been years since release and the big issues still persist. I consider myself robbed for having bought this game, and if I were to ever meet the developers I would treat them as thieves who have stolen from me."
"A great Medieval Strategy game with lots of units, buildnings, upgrade branches, different nations and warfare where each and every unit counts towards victory. I allso recommend the campain as it is following real histories of for example Atilla The Hun, Gengis Kahn, Rome and so on"
"not only has this game made a huge impact on my childhood, it is still to this day one of the best rts games of all time. deffinitely worth picking up"
Dispite being old it stands up to the test of time.
"This game so good, i played 3 DLCs, AMAZING. But has any problem sometimes games crashes and low performance though fps ~ 60, IDK but not good when i start to play. Hope studio can resolve that, Thanks!"
getting kicked out of game cause i dont have raja xpack keeps saying im trying to create a unit from that xpack even tho im not.!

This seriously is such a good game!
"Gather around children, Dracathio has a story to tell.  Once upon a time a crazy ginger went on the road with his crazy father, while on the road he came across a demo game on his dad's laptop, titled Age of Empires Demo. The crazy bored out of his mind ginger figured 'hm lets try this' about a week or so later over killed three very unqiue seniors and was so badly wanting to try the other features that were grayed out on the menu screen. He finally gets home from being on the road and gets the game in gold edition, he beats the senerios and plays them again, and beats them again, he than gets the sequal and does the same dang thing. He decides to spend hours upon hours messing around with random maps destroying empires that try to build up decently and laughs when the enemy doesn't know how to tower defense because bad programming. He realizes though he keeps on scratching up the disc's from constant play.  He than gives up on trying to get another copy and moves on with his gaming, over 10 years later he sees a steam summer sale and buys this version and feels the biggest wave of nastalga ever, and that grin from long ago comes across his face once more.   ------------------------------------------------ My love for strategy games started with that single demo on my father's laptop, from age of empires i spread across to playing games like Evony, Evony2, Castlelot, Three Kingdoms Online, Age of Kings, Backyard Monsters, Clash of Clans, Civilization 5, and many others I just can't remember.  If you are asking if i would recommend this game, the answer would be 'HECK YEAH MAN', because even though this game is old it is a game that can keep on being played for another good 10-20 years and still not get old as long as you have other's to play along with/against. To me Civ 5 is nothing compared to this, turn based and limited resources isn't really as much fun as being able to actually build up your own defenses and hope your enemy doesn't come in and covnert your whole army against you."
"Well, it´s still AoE 2 ...do you have money for shopping? Your call...."
"This game is awesome, I played it alot during my youth and while many would want the HD update to be a complete overall, I for one like seeing it as it was with only few modifications done.  While I will dispute with the price I must confess that it is best to be gotten on sale."
I don't like this game ...*WOLOLO* I love this game !!!!
"Awesome, Just do it. It's as good as it was back then.  Edit: Nominated for the “Test of Time” Award"
"It doesn't matter how old this game may be, it is obvious that it is still alive and that the developers are very much interested in delivering a fun and entertaining experience with it. I reccomend it 100%"
Old But Gold!
not enough 'wololos'
Interface scaling doesn't work so it's unplayable on 4K screens.
Air Conditioning.
It's AOE2 what other reasons do you need to play
My favorite RTS game of all time. This is great on LAN or in single player. I recommend this to anyone who likes RTS games.

This made me stick my ♥♥♥♥ in a light socket
The greatest AOE yet
One of the best RTS game of all times.
This game has been around the block time and time again. I played this as a kid and loved it then- I would recommend this for any age as it incorporates strategy and warfare into building an empire and surviving along the way. This is a don't miss title ever if it is aged.
The age of empire HD is a game you will enjoy if you had played company of heroes.
9/10
What a game.
Who needs scouts to explore the map when you can use sheep.
So great! Its so nice to play this childhood favorite with friends.
Really good game.
Nostalgia: The Game
Love this game 10/10
Age of empires nuff said !!!!
Interface scaling doesn't work so it's unplayable on 4K screens.
Best strategy EVER!
"Age of Empires 2: Netcode is still ♥♥♥♥ Edition.  Nahhh it aint that bad but seriously, competitive games outside of LAN are impossible due to the input lag. I r8 a hun rush out of 10"
This game is for Meme's
"The first RTS game I played in my life, now in HD. Ultra highly recommended."
"Very buggy game. I played the original growing up in the early 2000's on older hardware without a problem. This 'HD' version is much slower even with modern hardware. Not nearly as fluid. The final map in the Yodit campaign will crash every time if you go to a certain part of the city (unnecessary for winning, but still a severe bug! The entire game just exits!). The path noding and AI seem to have taken a hit as well. Armies won't navigate well. All the hotkey buttons have changed from the original. The extra campaigns (African and Forgotten) are just awful. No nice way to say it. The voice acting seems to be done by one amatuer. NOTHING like the original AOK! Severely lacking in quality and story! As somebody who owns multiple copies of AOE, I cannot recommend this. You are not missing out on anything. Anyone who wants to play this game online should use the original and connect via Voobly (pretty much replaced GameSpy network for matchmaking) instead of Steam. I don't have much confidence that they'll be able to fix all these underlying problems. The game has become crippled and not nearly as lightweight as it once was."
Its a good gaming experience 
My favorite RTS game of all time. This is great on LAN or in single player. I recommend this to anyone who likes RTS games.
It's AOE2 what other reasons do you need to play
Forget the last time i played this game. Still as much fun as it was when i first played it.
not enough 'wololos'
  i'd say this game has pretty good use of farm animals
THIS IS A TOTAL COPY OF THE GODLY GAME MINECRAFT!!!!
"This game was my childhood. Little old me walking up to windows XP computer and playing this for hours. Ahh, good times ^_^  This game is one of the best RTS games out there, even to this day. Even if the graphics may look bad, or you've seen the memes on buildings catching on fire with a bow and arrow, this game is still fine to play and is timeless.   Just play it, you will not regret it :)"
Been playing this game my entire life Improvements r awsome and the seamlessness of adding and removing mods add a whole new dynamic to the game i love it..
well i guess i brought this is game on sale and i know i didint wasted money on this game. first aoe game i played is III and it sucks so glad i tried aoe II hahaha 
"An extremely robust RTS that still holds up well today. Even though the graphics are certainly dated, (which I think it adds a retro charm to the game) Age of Empires 2 easily offers hundreds of hours of gameplay. But don't get me wrong, this game can be *CHALLENGING* but getting better and refining your strategy is amazingly satisfying.  And with the added Steam multiplayer support, this game is a hoot with friends. Definitely recommended."
I loved this game as a kid and I love it now!
"Overall the greatest game I've ever played on the Steam market. It's far from a modern game based on realism and immersion, but the replayability and stress-free gameplay that one can just enjoy with friends is amazing. I highly recommend this product and at least investing the money during a sale for a few good times with friends. You won't regret it."
Like the original but even better great game
Best game.Ty for Age of Empires African Lag.I cant play single player(ofc multyplayer too).Go Goths and laaaaag
Age2 is by far the best RTS ever!     Timeless fun.
This seriously is such a good game!

Worth the money to have a digital copy of one of my favorite games ever
Addictive game really good to play with friends and strangers
I have nominated this game for the past of time award because I been playing this game since I have five years old and every time I play I have the same experience that the first time I played the game. It's unique mechanics and gameplay make this game a masterpice that keeps shining while time passes. The graphics are unique and works perfect with the game art and mode. It's a unique experience that everyone should try.
"This game is awesome, I just love it, but I can´t give it a good review with that multiplayer, there is always lag and there is no way I can play a good game with my friends, Why don´t they fix that? It´s been a while now..."
"Have you ever wanted to Bang something and your pp is too small? Look no further my friends, AOE2 has you covered. You just play god and beat the crap out of the other team. Just WOLOLOLO Yeah them and take everything.  10/10 would have relics stolen again"
"I grew up with this game and I needed it back in my life, So I payed $20 to get updated water textures"
i love when the monkeys rip out someones splean. i laughed for hours 
  Childhood and now part of my morning ritual before work every day.  Coffee and a quick match of aoe a day keeps the autism away    
I've spent countless hours playing this game during my child/teenage years. it still has a place in my heart &lt;3  10/10 Would send my army on a suicide mission again.

Its a good gaming experience 
i will never in my life get over this EPIC AND I SAY EPICCCCCCCC game but i just wish it had better servers cuz the lag is killing me other then that THIS GAME IS TRULY EPIC
A classic game for the strategy/RTS gamer. This is the very beginnig and It's a 'must' for anyone who likes the type of genre. Highly recommended! 
It's quite an amazing feat when you manage to win against 7 Britons...  ... as the Byzantines.   11/10 will get peppered by arrows again.
"Excellent remake!! You will get a lot of fun with this, and new content is a good call from steam. Shut up and take my money!!"
"It all works for me, windows 8.1.  I got it for $4.00 and it's a bargain at that price. Development seems to be current, they're releasing expansions for it.  Get in on a sale and you won't regret it."
extremely fun and still better than aoe3 in my opinion
"This game was my childhood, I learned a ton about history with it too, I would go as far as to say this is the best edutainment games ever. I love this game and the cheesy sound effects make it even more nostalgic, I love to use my hun hordes to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. 10/10"
Eeeh.... NICE until now the develop make a DLC
The age of empire HD is a game you will enjoy if you had played company of heroes.
I loved this game as a kid and I love it now!
I really love hwo they cosntantly update the UI and it is almost better than voobly's but the ping experience and number of people doesnt compare. sorry.
"Aoe2 is such a classic but this 'HD' version has some serious work yet. For some the game works flawless for for others it's a complete b*** to even get running. My expeirence is that in game sound cuts in and out and the music plays for about 15 sec and then starts another track, which i can live with. One of the biggest problems is that the game crashes on me maybe an hour in or even just 15 minutes into play, which is a very popular topic on the forums if you run into such an issue."
"Garbage, the multiplayer netcode is awful, they never went back and fixed it. This game is just a reskin, there is nothing HD about it, not worth even $2.   Avoid it at all costs, total trash."
"Very good game, no warmongering Gandhi thou."
vry gud gaym i play wif vrend all time but del wont buy
"I recommend this game, but as a word of caution. If you only buy the African Expansion and not The Forgotten Expansion you will not be able to load any saved games, This causes a serious issue. I heard The Forgotten Expansion had so many bad reviews that I didn't buy it, I heard that the African Expansion had great reviews so I bought it. 90 minutes into a mission I was getting tired, I saved the game only to return today and I can't load the game because I don't have the Forgotten Expansion.  I'm going to log a formal complaint with steam, on the basis of an incomplete game forcing players to buy DLC in order to save progress. This is in strict violation of steams agreement with software companies, where in they must provide meet specific requires one of which any DLC may not directly influence the players ability to play or not to play a game and must only be sold as an extention of the game itself and should and can't be required to have to play the game.  At this point, I will be getting my money back, by either going through steams process or reversing the payment on my card for services not rendered."
Just updating my review..
This is a gaem.
Stabbed a building with a sword until it caught on fire and blew up 10/10
"I have been playing this game for years.  I got this version for $3 on sale, but it's worth whatever the price is now. I am just a poorfag."
the book was better
It's still the best strategy game ever. 10/10
"10/10 Would conquer, oppress and enslave other nations again. wololo"
I love every single aspect of it
thicc af
This is possibly the best RTS I've played. If you like the genre this is a worthy use of money.
Been playing this for ages and ages still see myself playing this with the grand kids one day :P  10 / 10
"I really like the game, but...WHEN MY FRIEND WOLOLOLOLOS I FRICKEN LOSE IT HE WINS EVERY FRICKEN TIME WITH THAT PLS FIX VOLVO"
"Absolutelly awesome game. After many years playing on old PC with friend over LAN or Hamachi it works and looks better then ever. Great looks on big monitors, without bugs or crashes. Thanks community you can use many maps, mods and more :). Everything works. Worths for every spend €. Edit: Working community ^^"
Pwning nubz since 1999.
This game is so FUNNNNN
"I can't remember how long ago it was that I bought Age of Empires, but I still have 1, 2 and Mythology on CD/DVD. The only real reason I bought the HD version here on Steam was the convenience of not having to load in and out a disc all the time. In truth the game is solid, it's the game that you all remember. The AI was never very clever, but AOE2 took the next step on from AOE. It's a decent balance of build, strategy and has (had) a half-decent multiplayer too. This HD version takes the original and makes a few minor surface tweaks. It's slightly better looking, but it all looks pretty much the same.   There is one tiny problem. The pricing here on Steam. I was fortunate enough to get this version through a Humble Bundle, but I'd NEVER pay £14 for a copy of the game. Even $14 is too much. The HD 'extra' isn't something that really justifies the extra spend. If you're after this game get the original on disc or keep an eye out for sales. Paying the extra for the HD really doesn't seem worth it. The original disc still runs fine on my Alienware 14, it doesn't always look wonderful, but it's perfectly playable. My opinion is that it's just not worth the extra cash for something that isn't that improved.  Additionally, the new 'Forgotten' Campaign certainly isn't worth the extra money. There are literally thousands of user generated maps and campaigns that you can get out there for free.  If you've got AOE2 already on disc, keep using that. If you've never played AOE get it on disc (it's probably cheaper), or wait for a sale somewhere.  To be clear I'm recommending the game over the HD extra stuff here on steam."
great for playing with mates
"A no-frills and effective update for a timeless RTS. What does this essentially do? It gives you touched up visuals, new resolutions, steam integration, and a new multiplayer lobby system. That's all it really is and that's all it needs to be. AoE II is still loads of fun."
Demolition ships.
"- Monk, I need a monk!  - Wololo!  /Rogan"
"At this point in time the programming is very poor! I bought the game and am very disappointed! It runs very slowly regardless of what you are doing. I am very upset! Scrolling is abysmal, your new hot key programming is not the same as the original game but luckily I can change that. Overall I do not reccomend this game and want a refund!"
"Pretty unplayable. They made it look pretty and then resold it for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of money. There are virtually no players because they divided the community between HD and Forgotten Empires editions, people from across the world with horrible connections constantly plague the game and make every game unplayable. I loved this game, for over 15 years, played it more than any other game, but they've successfully made it not fun anymore. Now they're working on a new expansion, which I assume will bring loads of new civilizations and units, and absolutely ZERO improvement to the netcode, or removal of bugs, or catastrophic game-breaking lag or desynchronizations, or lobby browser, or anything else to make it simply more fun to play, and then sell it for another cool 20 euros.   If you love aoe anyway and are die-hard, buy it and enjoy yourself despite the above, if you've never played, don't even bother unless it's for the campaign. The multiplayer is pointless."
Played this when I was 10.  10 Year Old Me: &gt;play game &gt;build up fort &gt;defend every once in awhile &gt;build up army &gt;attack &gt;win  Me Now: &gt;play game &gt;build up fort &gt;find myself surrounded by enemy workers &gt;they keep building towers around my base &gt;weep softly as my childhood is crushed around me &gt;entire base converted by priests.  I give Childhood Destroyer 2015 Game a 6/10.
"It is very frustrating that the game does not save changed hotkeys. I googled a lot around and some people apparently have found solutions like running Steam with adminisitrative priviliges, but nothing has worked for me. Very disappointing."
"As much as I love this game, but it wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing run. I've tried changing the Launcher name, verify cache, reinstall, none of which worked. Nothing happens after pressing Start in the launcher, if I skip the launcher part, literally nothing happens."
"Age Of Empires 'HD' vs Age Of Mythology  Are the graphics good enough to be called an HD remake?  - No, Textures quality are really low and bad. Not good enough for what I think are acceptable in an HD remake.  The Game mechanics compared to Age Of Mythology are much worse. The AI and movements are stupid and slow. Multitasking in a RTS game are very important but you can not stack up any orders from workers or buildings except for when you are building Units. Which requires you attention at all times so you can't explore or move units in battle also very frustrating for me.   In combat you will get your units lost behind building because you can't see them and grouping your units to have a more advance stratergy does not exist.  The minimap is small and does not give you a good overview of the battlefield buildings are units.  Basing my review in comparrisent to Age Of Mythology I would rather recommend it then Age Of Empires II HD if you want a more casual and simpler RTS game with a more updated game engein.  But if you are a hardcore fan of the series and liked the old game mechanics and the problems from this older game and you feel nostalgic, it is for you.  Sorry but the game was not for me..."
20 year old game what now fits on 1920x1080.. It looks like ♥♥♥♥ and the pathfinding problems have not been addressed. Other than that the great classic play style is still there if you can handel the pathfinding.

It's a unique experience that everyone should try.
"Great game but historically inaccurate, I played against ethiopia and they had food  8/10"
"This game is awesome, I just love it, but I can´t give it a good review with that multiplayer, there is always lag and there is no way I can play a good game with my friends, Why don´t they fix that? It´s been a while now..."
  Childhood and now part of my morning ritual before work every day.  Coffee and a quick match of aoe a day keeps the autism away    
"Fantastic, brilliant, amazing game, do yourself a favour, don't buy it on steam, the steam version crashes frequently, is riddled with bugs and isn't worth the additional DLC."
I've spent countless hours playing this game during my child/teenage years. it still has a place in my heart &lt;3  10/10 Would send my army on a suicide mission again.
"The real time strategy game that introduced me to the genre, but in HD! Love, love, love. Doesn't have LAN support though, so that's a load of ♥♥♥♥."
"Age Of Empires 'HD' vs Age Of Mythology  Are the graphics good enough to be called an HD remake?  - No, Textures quality are really low and bad. Not good enough for what I think are acceptable in an HD remake.  The Game mechanics compared to Age Of Mythology are much worse. The AI and movements are stupid and slow. Multitasking in a RTS game are very important but you can not stack up any orders from workers or buildings except for when you are building Units. Which requires you attention at all times so you can't explore or move units in battle also very frustrating for me.   In combat you will get your units lost behind building because you can't see them and grouping your units to have a more advance stratergy does not exist.  The minimap is small and does not give you a good overview of the battlefield buildings are units.  Basing my review in comparrisent to Age Of Mythology I would rather recommend it then Age Of Empires II HD if you want a more casual and simpler RTS game with a more updated game engein.  But if you are a hardcore fan of the series and liked the old game mechanics and the problems from this older game and you feel nostalgic, it is for you.  Sorry but the game was not for me..."
fu*k your sh*t updates
"IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING MULTIPLAYER, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.  I have played this game since I was a little kid and I do still enjoy the game, but the reason why I bought this game again was because of the multiplayer and that just sucks. bringing the game to steam was rather to farm some extra money, then to give the player a real improved game. ofcourse they made it HD and 'made' a new expansion, but the expansion has been a free mod for over 14 years.   I had hoped on a better multiplayer exprience, but they only brushed the game up."
"Played this loads when I was younger, I used to sit for hours and hours just playing back to back games.  A true classic, one of my personal favourite games of all time."
Nostalgia is the only reason to buy this game and even then chances are you will regret the purchase in hindsight. Horrible 'HD' remake.
"its ok, only played a bit so can't really say."
"This game does not work, Valve will not refund you for buying this buggy garbage.  Despite being called a 'HD' title you can not set the resolution in-game, as such the game will try to support your desktop resolution using a very buggy algorithm. The result for me is that Age of Empires II HD actually runs at a lower effective resolutionon my 1280x1024 display than the original game did.  Despite the fact that my computer meets all the requirements and that the title clearly is not a HD version as it claims to be, Valve will not refund you if you're foolish enough to trust that this title will work as expected.  If you're really determined to buy this then I'd really advise you look at the support page and be really sure that it'll work with your setup."
"Age of Empires II is a good game, especially when playing with friends and the HD edition's proper multiplayer setup is a great thing in that area. Sadly, aside from that improved multiplayer setup and only slightly better graphics it brings very little to the table. I would have never gotten the game if it wasn't for a steam sale since I own the old fashioned edition and its expansion, both of which were still readily available in boxed retail for a fraction of the price. The game simply brings nothing in the way of new gameplay (perhaps in the DLC which I admit I haven't bought) and while I love the game to death, I would simply not recomend shelling out more than twice the price of the classic version for what ultimatly amounts to a slightly better paint-job."
This game is great for single player and LAN but the online part is VERY laggy. Dont buy for to use online - or at least beware of this. Paying full price for a old game is not worth it when it's unplayable online for most of us at least.
"It seems that multiplayer issues will never be addressed. I wan't may money back, Microsoft!"
"New AI has absolutely ruined it. I am not the best player at it but Easiest setting is more like moderate, so there is no room left for a leisurely game. completely screwed it up with the new update. Don't bother if you are a casual gamer!!!!"
"I always loved this game, it has huge nostalgia value for me so playing AoE II is usually wonderful. However this is not so much. would be. But for some reason every game seems to lap severely. Sometimes to the point that it freezes up and I have to shut off the game. Every mach. No matter how few players, how small the population, or even if I turn off all the high def settings. Eventually it always starts to lap. I would love this if it would stop and I could actually play throuh a whole game.. I know my computer has well over what it takes to run this game so I don't know why its not working right. Maybe my version of windows is too new, I don't know. If someone has any ideas, please message me or something. Until then, I cant give it a good review, but I have to saw I do enjoy the new features very much before it starts lagging. I wish I didn't spend money on this."
DAT LAGG  i have i5 4670k and gtx 780 and i have like 5 fps plz fix that but it is a really nice game   Tijs
spent 30 bucks and cant even login
I absolutely loved the original game but the HUD/UI in this HD remake is so tiny that it is unplayable for me on my 27' 2560x1440 monitor... Very disappointing :(
"I played Age of Empires when it first came out so very long ago, and I spent hours playing and loving that game. Heck, I enjoyed it so much that I ended up minoring in History in college just because the game inspired me to learn more about these cultures and people. When I saw Age of Empires II HD on Steam, I happily bought the game, expecting to relive a little of the magic of my youth. After playing some skirmish matches and on the campaign, I cannot recommend Age of Empires II HD for, really, any price.  My problems with this game do not have to do with the older graphics system or gameplay. On the contrary, the original visuals and gameplay were (and still are) quite charming and challenging respectively. My biggest problems stem from the hyped visual overhaul and new gameplay options. The original visuals were well done, yet I cannot distinguish any real difference between the original game's visuals and the 'HD' visuals. The only difference, I assume, is that the 'HD' means widescreen support as opposed to a real overhaul of the graphics. Since I don't play the game on widescreen, there's really no visual difference between the original and the HD.  As for the gameplay itself, I seem to encounter massive slow down in mid-to-late game skirmishes despite a pretty decent ROG laptop (Intel Core i5 2.5 GhZ, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M, 8 GB RAM). The developers warn that population should only be set at 75, but if the option runs up to 500 and offers 'LudaKRIS' size maps, why would I stick to one of the lowest population and map settings when my rig can run Total War: Rome II on med-high settings without stuttering? When I try to play at the higher or medium settings for Age of Empires II HD, the game becomes virtually unplayable. Even at population sizes of 100, I experience significant slow down when playing with 7 AI. The fact is, if a modern gaming rig can't handle this rehash of a much older game with barelu updated graphics, then why even own it in the first place? Really disappointing showing, and I should've spent more time checking out the reviews on metacritic and the like before buying this game."
RIPOFF! For all those who want to play Age of Empires II: This is worth nothing. Get the original AoE2 and install the latest community patch (still being updated). It looks virtually identical and is FREE. This here is a waste of money and I only got it because of a recent Humble Bundle.
"Very few new, the new campaings are made in hurry, they aren't even dubbed. I was expecting more new features, like better graphics, more unique units, you know, things to make different the gameplay with each faction, like Age of Empires 3 had. If they launch a new expantion I hope they at least give a improvement in the graphics and makes more changes in each faction, just one new technology, and sometimes isn't even good, it is not enough."
"I was expecting new assets, but it really just seems like the same game."
Not good.Do not buy it.i regret buying it.SO MUCH UNBEARABLE LAGS.!!!
"While the new graphics for the game are quite stunning and the lovable parts of the Age of Empires II original are maintained, there are evident faults that shouldn't have been overlooked. The removal of graphcis options is a big one for me, causing low-end PC's that were quite capable of playing the original now unable to handle the improved version. The other gaping flaw is that while they maintained the good, they also maintained the bad. Bugs like the patrol bug were simply left in game, apparently to 'keep the classic Age of Empires II mechanics' but in effect turning away a large potential playerbase. While HiddenPath tried to improve the game, the lack of graphics changing and bug fixing leaves me wondering how Microsoft Studios could publish this without updates."
Don't buy this game. It has some bugs and won't be fixed. You can't choose resolution and multiplayer lags. It's a scam.  No compren este juego. Tiene bugs que no serán arreglados. No se puede elegir la resolución y multiplayer laguea. Una estafa.
HD my ♥♥♥. It looks crap.
"Utter trainwreck made by complete amateurs. The mod version, Forgotten Empires is much better."
"I LOVE Age of Empires 2. Wonderful game. I still play it to this day and that's why I purchased the HD version along with the Forgotten expansion. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with both. The new features that have been added are not enough to make up for the issues. Most of the issues with the new version of the game were present in the original game like multiplayer lag and the game going out of sync. I expected these serious problems to be fixed with a new version of the game I paid for. I think if you enjoy playing single player then you will have fun with this but if you prefer multiplayer, there is no way I can recommend this."
Played this when I was 10.  10 Year Old Me: &gt;play game &gt;build up fort &gt;defend every once in awhile &gt;build up army &gt;attack &gt;win  Me Now: &gt;play game &gt;build up fort &gt;find myself surrounded by enemy workers &gt;they keep building towers around my base &gt;weep softly as my childhood is crushed around me &gt;entire base converted by priests.  I give Childhood Destroyer 2015 Game a 6/10.
"It is very frustrating that the game does not save changed hotkeys. I googled a lot around and some people apparently have found solutions like running Steam with adminisitrative priviliges, but nothing has worked for me. Very disappointing."
"I can't remember how long ago it was that I bought Age of Empires, but I still have 1, 2 and Mythology on CD/DVD. The only real reason I bought the HD version here on Steam was the convenience of not having to load in and out a disc all the time. In truth the game is solid, it's the game that you all remember. The AI was never very clever, but AOE2 took the next step on from AOE. It's a decent balance of build, strategy and has (had) a half-decent multiplayer too. This HD version takes the original and makes a few minor surface tweaks. It's slightly better looking, but it all looks pretty much the same.   There is one tiny problem. The pricing here on Steam. I was fortunate enough to get this version through a Humble Bundle, but I'd NEVER pay £14 for a copy of the game. Even $14 is too much. The HD 'extra' isn't something that really justifies the extra spend. If you're after this game get the original on disc or keep an eye out for sales. Paying the extra for the HD really doesn't seem worth it. The original disc still runs fine on my Alienware 14, it doesn't always look wonderful, but it's perfectly playable. My opinion is that it's just not worth the extra cash for something that isn't that improved.  Additionally, the new 'Forgotten' Campaign certainly isn't worth the extra money. There are literally thousands of user generated maps and campaigns that you can get out there for free.  If you've got AOE2 already on disc, keep using that. If you've never played AOE get it on disc (it's probably cheaper), or wait for a sale somewhere.  To be clear I'm recommending the game over the HD extra stuff here on steam."
if you want to sit on your ♥♥♥ for a few hours just to lose get this game
"I totally love Age of Empires II, which I'v bought this game, but only because at a very good discount. The 'HD' sets certain expectations regarding more modern graphics, but in practice doesn't deliver. I hope the studio in question will release a High-res texture pack to compensate this. Other downside is the lack of LAN support, you are dependent on online servers for connectivity, which may cause lag in LAN games."
region restricted when you buy the 4 pack - no mention of this when you buy however - so bought 4 games for me and my friends - mine works ok - but cannot gift the other copies to any of my friends - really dissapointed to be honest .
launchs but never starts. no matter what i do
Would be great if they had done any modernisation at all. Want to queue orders or select multiple buildings? Play something else.
"Why are all the hotkeys changed? The majority of people who buy this HD-touchup are the people who loved the original, so changing the controls is a BIG nono, especially when the changes make no sense! To build a barracks, it used to be (B)uild (B)arracks, now it's 'A', 'Q'!? It used to be (B)uild (D)ock, now it's 'A', 'T'. What's the logic in that? If you're going to be idiots and change the ****** hotkeys, at least make them make sense. What is WRONG with you developers?!  I can go change them all back myself, sure, but it's less time-consuming for me to go dig out the old cd and install that.  Plus, you 'improve the AI', but you neglect to fix something simple like the non-functioning shift-click movement queuing? What a waste of my 5 dollars. I can't recommend this to anyone. I should have read reviews first. WASTE OF MY TIME."
"Big resolution issues that are not fixed. Ironically, the original game looks and runs better. Lazy cash grab conversion is simply a lazy cash grab conversion. Huge disappointment. Having to waiting for a genius in the modding community to write a mod which enables a simple ingame resolution change so everything is not so zoomed in."
"I can see why a lot of people would like this game, but I just don't really enjoy it. It plays a lot like dota 2, which isn't bad, however, the graphics were just awful."
"this game should not be allowed to be called 'HD' the graphics are still terrible and it looks like upscaled 800x600. there is no visual difference whatsoever unless you compare side by side. and the stupid unit selection cap of 40 is STILL there, so of course when you attack someone you have to order around 5 or more different squads to attack instead of one large one because the pathfinding has not been fixed either. it is honestly hard to tell what they did other than rename and relaunch."
i want a refund this game sucks and its not even hd
"Age of Empires was and always will be an amazing game.  This HD remake, however, is not!  Yes, it has updated graphics, Steam Multiplayer support, and Steam Workshop, but the multiplayer has 500ms lag built in, constant errors and dropping of players. This game is almost unplayable on multiplayer! I reinstalled the original with the Userpatch. It looks better and runs better than this piece of junk."
"I love the game itself, but the HD version is very unreliable. It often quits unexpectedly and doesn't run well on Windows 8. I have spent tons of time on this game only to be continually frustrated by errors and buggy performance."
When they announced that the wanted to create a up to date version of Ages of Empires II I was really happy. I played the game often when I was younger. But I must say I was hoping for more than they did. The graphic isn't much better than the 'normal' version. And they didn't update the game for higher screen resolutions. So personally I think it isn't worth the money.
Still a good game
How do I turn this on ?    👌👌👌
Best RTS game ever ;) There are some unbalanced civs but it's an amazing game overall!
Demolition ships.
"Age of Empires 2 is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. It is simple to pick up, but difficult to master. Even though my steam says I only have about 15 hours on record at the time of this review, I have played this game well over 100 hours on different computers.  The graphics hold up even to today. The vanilla textures are pleasing to look at, and everything is nice and charming. Because this game has so few hardware requirements, you can have huge maps, tons of soldiers, and lots of different mods all running at once with little strain on your system.  The campaigns range in difficulty from super easy to rather difficult. Each campaign has you follow the history of some of the world's greatest military commanders, and you control the battles they fight in. The missions can last from 30 minutes to well over an hour, and are all fun with lots of hidden secrets. There are also many stand-alone battles, which usually focus much more on military tactics rather than exploration and resource management. You can also play a quick match with the setting, opponents, and goal of your choosing.   This game also has a thriving multiplayer scene. I've heard that many people have trouble with getting online to work, though, so you may run into trouble if you decide to play multiplayer. And for players who have played lots of strategy games before, you may find that the game is too easy, especially for some campaigns. Sometimes, the AI bugs out as well. For example, I had a group of knights run off and attack a mining camp when I explicitly told them to attack a barracks. These instances are usually rare, and they do not impact play that much.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game both at the sale price of roughly 4 dollars, and the full price. I also recommend buying all the available DLC, as they give you more civilizations and extra campaigns. This is an engrossing, fun strategy game that has stood the test of time, and will continue to be one of the top computer strategy games for years to come."
I will never recommend this game. The game was deleted many elments. I am disappointed.
"The real time strategy game that introduced me to the genre, but in HD! Love, love, love. Doesn't have LAN support though, so that's a load of ♥♥♥♥."
Very fun stratedgy game. Brought back good memories from my childhood.  Nostalgia to the max. Worth the small price tag.
"I used to play this a lot as a teenager but now just bought it again as I felt nostalgic. It is a great game, the graphics are of old type, but I do not mind, in fact I prefer it from AOE III. I like its multiplayer feature. Has some DLCs too but anyway it has a taste of childhood warmth and I am personally bonded with the music soundtrack and the sound effects."
One Of the best games I've ever played - addicted!
Even better than the old Age of Empires II  I have lots of fun playing this with friends
If you loved the classic AOE 2 then seriously just get this.   &gt;Multiplayer is a breeze thanks to steam.  &gt;Steam workshop akes mods so much easier  &gt;Modern computers won't make the grass purple and rainbow coloured anymore.  &gt;Age of Empires II HD you have 500 population limit.  This game has solved all the problems AOE 2 originally had and left everything that was good about the game.   Any Age of Empires die-hard fan should own this game. 10/10
"This game is awesome, I just love it, but I can´t give it a good review with that multiplayer, there is always lag and there is no way I can play a good game with my friends, Why don´t they fix that? It´s been a while now..."
Addictive game really good to play with friends and strangers
I've spent countless hours playing this game during my child/teenage years. it still has a place in my heart &lt;3  10/10 Would send my army on a suicide mission again.
"Great game but historically inaccurate, I played against ethiopia and they had food  8/10"
"Have you ever wanted to Bang something and your pp is too small? Look no further my friends, AOE2 has you covered. You just play god and beat the crap out of the other team. Just WOLOLOLO Yeah them and take everything.  10/10 would have relics stolen again"
"I grew up with this game and I needed it back in my life, So I payed $20 to get updated water textures"
i love when the monkeys rip out someones splean. i laughed for hours 
unplayable for new update.. it shows same mission after win
IS THERE A ♥♥♥♥ING REASON WHY NOONE CAN JOIN MULTIPLAYER GAMES?!?!?!?!?!?! PLEASE HELP
"Always crash and poor people, Piece of ♥♥♥♥ I lost almost 20bucks and never recommend"
"This game is a re-release of the original age of empires 2, fantastic game at the time of the original release. One of the best RTS’s at the time however over the years has lost a lot of its original flavor that made it great to play.Fan’s of the original will enjoy playing this for a while as it brings back a lot of memories however anyone looking to play age of empires, I would suggest age of empires 3 as it has a lot more for your money and its updated features make the game much more enjoyable. Worth a play if its going for cheap, however just does not complete with modern RTS’s."
"I bought this game because it was on sale. And, this freking lousy game does not work. It is not launching."
"If you liked the old AoE2, might as well keep it at this point. If you never got AoE2, then get this version. The game is not worth $20 for updated graphics and to add insult to injury they want you to pay money for what was a free modification, (Forgotten Empires), on the original game. Not to mention FE came with a bunch of difficulty levels for computers and the new version did not come with that on release (a patch is slated to add these in).   In short, not recommended unless you just like a bit prettier graphics. And just a bit better too. FE had already added in the ability to utilize larger resolutions in the game itself- again for free. For $5 when its on sale for 75% off? Sure, take a leap if you really like AoE2. Otherwise, steer clear."
"Do not buy this game!  Search google for Age of Empires 2 bad performance  The game is unplayable for me. It lags like crazy on my powerful PC. Its not the PC, its the game. I really cannot recommend this game in any way."
"Since the game has been released they try to do the maximum of benefices. They have only one server and very slow, it's hard to have a good ping the average is 1000-1500 pings... The HD version has just a new resolution that can be changed with some settings avalaible with a patch and the water and fire reworked doesn't fit with the old graphics. The game is very expensive and doesn't include the DLC, you have to pay a lot for a DLC released 15 years ago. Microsoft had originally earned a ♥♥♥♥ load ammount of money with the original game and they continue to scam us. They do as much as they can like i said to offer the minimum service, i mean one 56k server. We should do a petition to get refunded.  I don't recommend this game and now the servers are empty you must wait 30 minutes to join a game and almost everytime someone disconnect because of lags, or because it's unplayable it's like watching a powerpoint."
"The original game with the user patch does all this does and more. Less lag and better lan support, more mods (forgottern empires is free for example). Its a good game, but if you own AOE2 GOLD its not worth your time."
"Now I'm not an expert RTS-player and I do suck at micromanagment. It is unfortunately just an HD remake, the builders often get stuck between buildings or walls, neither does an attackmove forward exist, and I do miss that the most.  It is basicly the same game it was all those years ago, only in HD instead, and it's current pricing isn't helping either. Don't recommend this one"
Buggy and unoptimized. This game should not be dipping into single digit FPS on a modern system. There is an obvious lack of care placed into the game based on how poorly it runs. Either dig out your old copy or wait for GOG to release a version that isn't a waste of money.
"Very laggy game, still have bad graphics."
if you want to sit on your ♥♥♥ for a few hours just to lose get this game

"Multiplayer is lagging as hell(not talking about FPS here), and newer patches seemed to make it worse. I own a high-end computer and have a good internet connection for both DL/UL, but this game is unplayable. It even laggs when i play with PC's connected to the same router. I haven`t play the campaining so i don`t know how SP works. I also own the original AOE 2 and that one is considerable less laggy."
27 euro to a company who still can't fix aoe3.. nice
"Multiplayer does not work (netcode has not been improved since the original release, which means input lag). Singleplayer is the only redeeming factor but even that is bogged down by minor issues such as poor pathing and slowdowns when there are too many units on screen (regardless of hardware).  EDIT: As of 6/19/2015, the netcode is still utter ♥♥♥♥. One person can lagging makes everyone in the server lag."
"game runs like crap when you have a few AI on and around 100 pop, have tried it on 3 diffrent computers"
"I really like Age of Empires II. I spent hours and hours playing the original version. So i was encouraged to buy HD version and was looking forward to 'good old days with AOE'. However as soon as I started the game, huge framerate issue appeared. Well guess what? I would expect some framerate issue when playing new games, but this? How old is this game? I haven't had any issues on my Stone-Age-PC and now this HD version is completely unplayable on quad-core with good graphic card.  Not to mention that there is few and less added since the good ol' days. You can't set any graphics options and customer support is just awful.  Don't buy this game, unless you are 100% sure it will work on your machine (system requirements are meaningless). Otherwise you might as well throw your money out of a window."
"Since Patch 3.6 the game has pretty much become UNPLAYABLE. There is so much Lag (especially when using the standard line formation for troop movement), The A.I seems to have been 'improved' in that the difficulty is twice as hard as before (so easiest is easy, easy is standard, standard is hard, hard is hardest and hardest is Impossible!), combined with the lack of available diplomacy between A.I and players in singleplayer random maps (they used to but now never do) and the fact that even enemy teams no longer attack each other they just build up their forces and attack the human players first (tested in single and multiplayer). In Short nice idea but Terrible to play.  As an OLD gamer and having grown up with AoE:RoR this game is hardly anything like the AoE2 that i remember, sure it looks the same but the mechanics have been altered and fluidic gameplay is gone."
"Honestly, I find this game has severely lost its charm, and we shouldn't have to pay $20 to get a newer version of this game. The only real difference I have noticed is the fact that there are no longer any graphical errors on Win7, as well as moving water. I do not believe this game deserves this revitalisation in fan base. I gave it a go, because it was gifted to me, but I honestly just couldn't get back into it. If it weren't for the graphical issues on Win7 in the original, there would be no real bonus to buying this."
I will never recommend this game. The game was deleted many elments. I am disappointed.

There are also many stand-alone battles, which usually focus much more on military tactics rather than exploration and resource management. You can also play a quick match with the setting, opponents, and goal of your choosing.   This game also has a thriving multiplayer scene. I've heard that many people have trouble with getting online to work, though, so you may run into trouble if you decide to play multiplayer. And for players who have played lots of strategy games before, you may find that the game is too easy, especially for some campaigns. Sometimes, the AI bugs out as well. For example, I had a group of knights run off and attack a mining camp when I explicitly told them to attack a barracks. These instances are usually rare, and they do not impact play that much.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game both at the sale price of roughly 4 dollars, and the full price. I also recommend buying all the available DLC, as they give you more civilizations and extra campaigns. This is an engrossing, fun strategy game that has stood the test of time, and will continue to be one of the top computer strategy games for years to come."
"This game is so laggy and buggy, I ended up playing the old CD version of the game. I feel sorry for every penny I paid for this unplayable game. -I have a somewhat decent laptop(i7-3537U, GT 740M, 8 GB RAM, SSD) and I cannot play this game without lag even on single player with all visual effects turned off. -Multiplayer is plagued with sync errors and random drops. -Saved multiplayer games cannot be restored in most cases."
"Horrible horrible lag, regardless of your computer specs"
"nothing hd about it, same old graphics at 1080, don't buy this, pixels are the size of legos"
"This is my favorite game in the world. The update is beautiful. The new civilizations are awesome. The game play is great... unless you are in multiplayer. Then eventually the lag becomes so bad that the game becomes unplayable. If they could fix this single problem, it would be perfect. Not recommending a game has never been so painful."
"They managed to make a 13 year old game laggy on modern computers. No new content compared to the original game (except steam workshop). As a long time fan of the series, I'm really disappointed."
"What a horrible letdown. Hidden Path is appropriately named; the pathfinding in this game renders it unplayable. How, may I ask, did they manage to do this to a 14 year old game? There are some bright spots: better graphics, new civilizations, new units, and new campaigns. Unfortunatly, this does not mitigate the overall slopiness of the game. How much would it have cost to have voice acting for the campaigns, for example? The entire thing feels cobbled together. Honestly, the fan community could have done a better job, and probably will be the only way this diaster gets fixed."
would only be worth it if it was 5 bucks. otherwise its the exact same game as aoe. nothing of note was improved. only fun if youre playing with RL friends. hidden path is overcharging for an old game which you can just download somewhere. played 2 games and havent touched it since. its a shame really =/
"This game does not work, Valve will not refund you for buying this buggy garbage.  Despite being called a 'HD' title you can not set the resolution in-game, as such the game will try to support your desktop resolution using a very buggy algorithm. The result for me is that Age of Empires II HD actually runs at a lower effective resolutionon my 1280x1024 display than the original game did.  Despite the fact that my computer meets all the requirements and that the title clearly is not a HD version as it claims to be, Valve will not refund you if you're foolish enough to trust that this title will work as expected.  If you're really determined to buy this then I'd really advise you look at the support page and be really sure that it'll work with your setup."
"Age of Empires II is a good game, especially when playing with friends and the HD edition's proper multiplayer setup is a great thing in that area. Sadly, aside from that improved multiplayer setup and only slightly better graphics it brings very little to the table. I would have never gotten the game if it wasn't for a steam sale since I own the old fashioned edition and its expansion, both of which were still readily available in boxed retail for a fraction of the price. The game simply brings nothing in the way of new gameplay (perhaps in the DLC which I admit I haven't bought) and while I love the game to death, I would simply not recomend shelling out more than twice the price of the classic version for what ultimatly amounts to a slightly better paint-job."
This game is great for single player and LAN but the online part is VERY laggy. Dont buy for to use online - or at least beware of this. Paying full price for a old game is not worth it when it's unplayable online for most of us at least.
"It seems that multiplayer issues will never be addressed. I wan't may money back, Microsoft!"
"Installed it, didn'T want to play. I had 4 hours in and suddenly doesn'T even want to start up. Don't waste your money."
"It's just like the old AoE II with some extras:   GREAT GRAPHICS:  I sometimes just enter a game to stare at the buildings or some maps like Hun campaign first map.   AMAZING NEW BUGS: - Units for no apparent reason appear inside a cliff. Or any sort of unpassable terrain, like on top of a building and unable to move. Some times you have to to get a priest because of his high range and try to kill the last remaining enemy unit that 'teleported' in terrain you cant reach. My personal favorite: 2 transport ships with 40 paladins getting stack inside a cliff.  - Villagers standing idle on top of their farm (which still has 200 food) while you cant get them back to working on it.  - Mouse clicks some times don't have the effect you expect. e.g. visually it displays the 'attack' cursor but when you click it could just move there.  GREAT PRICE:  ... if you own micro$oft that is. The game is overpriced as hell. There are brand new games out there that are 1/4 of its price, which are similar quality. AoE HD is a graphics remake with addition of new bugs at a price 10 times its actual creation cost. Even at a 80% discount it's not worth buying. They simply have those discounts so that the buyer can get the wrong impression that it's a good deal."
"+ : Multiplayer works a lot easier than it did in the old days  - : This version is full of bugs that prevent a ton of people from playing. Every single update adds a new bug/crash that's annoying as hell. This game has 'HD' in its name yet is not HD at all. The sprites have the exact same resolution as before, the UI has the exact resolution as well. Ironically, the UI and texts have kept the same size in pixels as in 2003 which make it unusable and impossible to read in-game text on any high pixel density screen which are so common today. There is absolutly no way to scale the UI.  The fact that they've worked on a cash-cow DLC while the game has been full of bug for more than a year shows you just how much respect this studio has for players."
i want a refund this game sucks and its not even hd
"Age of Empires was and always will be an amazing game.  This HD remake, however, is not!  Yes, it has updated graphics, Steam Multiplayer support, and Steam Workshop, but the multiplayer has 500ms lag built in, constant errors and dropping of players. This game is almost unplayable on multiplayer! I reinstalled the original with the Userpatch. It looks better and runs better than this piece of junk."
"Dear AOC friends, to my opinion it´s still the best game ever but not on the steam platform   based on the technical issues with disconnection, lags etc. useless patches .... STEAM killed this epic game! Even with old fashioned technology like modem 14400 &gt; 10 years ago it was runing lag free and stable! WTF you are doing    Shame on the unprofessional setup of Age ! If you are not able to set up a game in a proper way don´t sell it. Maybe it would be helpful to asked the amateurs at Voobly how to do a good job !!!!  And don´t complain the others the game is to old......,   If you sell it´s your responsiblity to solve technical problems or give the customer their money back"
"Game is non-functional, no LAN multiplayer is routed through terrible servers so there is a constant delay while playing. You would be better off buying AOE complete from Walmart for $10, downloading a graphics fix and actually enjoying the game."
"Doesn't scale properly, I have to play in 1024x768 on my 1920x1200 display. The game is supposed to detect and adjust to the current resolution, but it doesn't. For some reason devs thought it would be a good idea to not include a manual setting for the resolution. I am  not the only one  facing this issue, this is ridiculous.  Other than that this is not a 'HD Edition' (whatever that means...) don't expect nice textures and animations, this is more a compatibility update for recent systems with a Steam workshop integration."
"New AI has absolutely ruined it. I am not the best player at it but Easiest setting is more like moderate, so there is no room left for a leisurely game. completely screwed it up with the new update. Don't bother if you are a casual gamer!!!!"
"I always loved this game, it has huge nostalgia value for me so playing AoE II is usually wonderful. However this is not so much. would be. But for some reason every game seems to lap severely. Sometimes to the point that it freezes up and I have to shut off the game. Every mach. No matter how few players, how small the population, or even if I turn off all the high def settings. Eventually it always starts to lap. I would love this if it would stop and I could actually play throuh a whole game.. I know my computer has well over what it takes to run this game so I don't know why its not working right. Maybe my version of windows is too new, I don't know. If someone has any ideas, please message me or something. Until then, I cant give it a good review, but I have to saw I do enjoy the new features very much before it starts lagging. I wish I didn't spend money on this."
DAT LAGG  i have i5 4670k and gtx 780 and i have like 5 fps plz fix that but it is a really nice game   Tijs
spent 30 bucks and cant even login
I absolutely loved the original game but the HUD/UI in this HD remake is so tiny that it is unplayable for me on my 27' 2560x1440 monitor... Very disappointing :(
"I played Age of Empires when it first came out so very long ago, and I spent hours playing and loving that game. Heck, I enjoyed it so much that I ended up minoring in History in college just because the game inspired me to learn more about these cultures and people. When I saw Age of Empires II HD on Steam, I happily bought the game, expecting to relive a little of the magic of my youth. After playing some skirmish matches and on the campaign, I cannot recommend Age of Empires II HD for, really, any price.  My problems with this game do not have to do with the older graphics system or gameplay. On the contrary, the original visuals and gameplay were (and still are) quite charming and challenging respectively. My biggest problems stem from the hyped visual overhaul and new gameplay options. The original visuals were well done, yet I cannot distinguish any real difference between the original game's visuals and the 'HD' visuals. The only difference, I assume, is that the 'HD' means widescreen support as opposed to a real overhaul of the graphics. Since I don't play the game on widescreen, there's really no visual difference between the original and the HD.  As for the gameplay itself, I seem to encounter massive slow down in mid-to-late game skirmishes despite a pretty decent ROG laptop (Intel Core i5 2.5 GhZ, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M, 8 GB RAM). The developers warn that population should only be set at 75, but if the option runs up to 500 and offers 'LudaKRIS' size maps, why would I stick to one of the lowest population and map settings when my rig can run Total War: Rome II on med-high settings without stuttering? When I try to play at the higher or medium settings for Age of Empires II HD, the game becomes virtually unplayable. Even at population sizes of 100, I experience significant slow down when playing with 7 AI. The fact is, if a modern gaming rig can't handle this rehash of a much older game with barelu updated graphics, then why even own it in the first place? Really disappointing showing, and I should've spent more time checking out the reviews on metacritic and the like before buying this game."
RIPOFF! For all those who want to play Age of Empires II: This is worth nothing. Get the original AoE2 and install the latest community patch (still being updated). It looks virtually identical and is FREE. This here is a waste of money and I only got it because of a recent Humble Bundle.
The game is good and looks better than it ever has before until it crashes. This game going through steam crashes constantly what ever they did its screwed up. There are not many online games being hosted by other players if you are into custom scenarios but there are some ranked RM ones open. In the end go with the normal aoe2 and not this one.

"Very few new, the new campaings are made in hurry, they aren't even dubbed. I was expecting more new features, like better graphics, more unique units, you know, things to make different the gameplay with each faction, like Age of Empires 3 had. If they launch a new expantion I hope they at least give a improvement in the graphics and makes more changes in each faction, just one new technology, and sometimes isn't even good, it is not enough."
"I LOVE Age of Empires 2. Wonderful game. I still play it to this day and that's why I purchased the HD version along with the Forgotten expansion. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with both. The new features that have been added are not enough to make up for the issues. Most of the issues with the new version of the game were present in the original game like multiplayer lag and the game going out of sync. I expected these serious problems to be fixed with a new version of the game I paid for. I think if you enjoy playing single player then you will have fun with this but if you prefer multiplayer, there is no way I can recommend this."

Burned down a castle using a spear.  10/10
Good stuff
"Age of Empires 2 is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. It is simple to pick up, but difficult to master. Even though my steam says I only have about 15 hours on record at the time of this review, I have played this game well over 100 hours on different computers.  The graphics hold up even to today. The vanilla textures are pleasing to look at, and everything is nice and charming. Because this game has so few hardware requirements, you can have huge maps, tons of soldiers, and lots of different mods all running at once with little strain on your system.  The campaigns range in difficulty from super easy to rather difficult. Each campaign has you follow the history of some of the world's greatest military commanders, and you control the battles they fight in. The missions can last from 30 minutes to well over an hour, and are all fun with lots of hidden secrets. There are also many stand-alone battles, which usually focus much more on military tactics rather than exploration and resource management. You can also play a quick match with the setting, opponents, and goal of your choosing.   This game also has a thriving multiplayer scene. I've heard that many people have trouble with getting online to work, though, so you may run into trouble if you decide to play multiplayer. And for players who have played lots of strategy games before, you may find that the game is too easy, especially for some campaigns. Sometimes, the AI bugs out as well. For example, I had a group of knights run off and attack a mining camp when I explicitly told them to attack a barracks. These instances are usually rare, and they do not impact play that much.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game both at the sale price of roughly 4 dollars, and the full price.

Hooray for multiplayer!!! 
As a gamer since grade school this brings back the memories. Awesome game.  11/10 would wololoo again.
"I have played this for as long as I can remember. When I saw the new HD version with the forgotten, I had to buy it. Nostalgia overload is all I have to say..."
Spent three hours fighting a 3v3 with a friend with frantic back and forth battles. Died to wolves. 10/10

"Originally, I said this game was okay.  DISCLAIMER: IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME MULTIPLAYER YOU WILL EXPERIENCE HUGE TRACTS OF NET LAG  THIS HAS SOURED MY WHOLE EXPERIENCE SO MUCH THAT I NO LONGER CAN RECOMMEND THIS GAME, IT HAS SOME WEIRD FLAWS AND SUCH THAT MY OWN REGULAR NON-STEAM COPY OF THE GAME DOES NOT HAVE, BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN NOW IGNORE THESE AS QUAINT LITTLE LEFTOVERS FROM THE FACT THAT THIS GAME IS OLD AS HELL  GO BUY AGE OF MYTHOLOGY OR SOMETHING, THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS ♥♥♥♥ING NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY  P.S When I say 'non-steam' I mean I've still got my old disks kicking around. I like CDs."
Hooray for multiplayer!!! 
One of the best startegy games! 10/10 - 'Nanobat'

"The best AoE by far.  Also, can those c*nts who send units to attack in the first 2 minutes kindly go f*ck themselves, thanks. :)"
I liked this game as a kid but its not as good as i remember.
"AoE and AoE:II are the epitome of great RTS games.. I played both of these games for thousands of hours, This HD version was a godsend."
"Utter trainwreck made by complete amateurs. The mod version, Forgotten Empires is much better."

"Age of Empires II is one of the best games i ever played. I still got the CD version. Now it's on steam i dont need to pray to the CD gods about my pc reading that scratchy CD. This version does not come with only visual enhancements, but it also comes with a better multiplayer experience and Steamworkshop support. This isn't just a HD version of a wonderful game, it's overall improvement of one of the best games ever created.  10/10 - IGN (Intellectual Gaming Nerd)"

"Builds a big army, Attacks bad guys, loses army, rage quits.."
Amazing game! It has to be my all time favourite. It's great coming back to it after a good decade. Endless fun!
"I play this for the LAN games with my friends.  But I can't do LAN, it forces me to play through their servers. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the latency is T E R R I B L E.  I'll try to move a villager and the villager takes 2 seconds to register that I clicked. It's hardly playable like this."
Multiplayer is laggy af
"It is unbelievable, we just saw yesterday that this awesome game is for 5$, and 1 day later we wanted to an 4vs4 party at home, but they've raised the price the next day to 20$. I will eventually ask for refund."
"It has nice campaign, ok, but when it comes to multiplayer, this game's a joke. You have to fiddle with it a LOT to get it working properly and still it's unsafe for an end-user to do such things as port opening. One mistake and you can do more harm than good. If you don't open the required ports, you will play with abysmal delays in multiplayer. Until they fix this, I do not recommend the game."
** (of 5) For its age and price a quite well made civilization game. There are however not many things to discover and all the games seem to be similar to each other. Will try the campaign and see if it is some more interesting. Maybe then a recommend...
most likely the best RTS ive everplayed 10/10
Super good for such an old game
"Age of Empires is a legendary RTS series, with a firmly established place among the best strategy games of all times.  How good is the HD edition?  Nothing really sticks out positively, except maybe the much nicer water fx and more map overview - but that's way too little after fifteen(!) years.  Mods do that for free!  Why not include new animations and icons that actually work with the new resolutions? Why not include the improved (read: less clunky) farming mechanics from Age of Mythology ? Why not produce at least new menus that look decent even for non-computer-archeologists? Hint: 90s PC graphics were horrible for the most part. etcetc  It is still a great game, but this HD Edition is a ripoff   The Emperor decrees 4 out of 5 yays for the classic RTS, then Mongols from the Ripoff Steppes invade and kill 1 out of 5 children with poorly designed HD arrows."
"The game was an absolute masterpiece when it was released over a decade ago, and a remake is most welcome. However this version runs terribly slowly (almost unplayablely so). I would recommend finding an original copy until this one is patched to deal with FPS issues."
"I give up on the battle of conquerors campaigns, they are so large, with so many units, makes the game unplayable / laggy as hell and yea with a gaming rig.  The new campaigns are buggy, I had to restart many times because the functions/triggers disabled the only way to win.  The UI is messed up even though they said it's improved.  Enemy units seem to be able to just walk right through gates.  I've been playing this game since the Zone, and not once have I seen units walk backwards like they do on this version. Idk what they are doing with the code but it's terrible. The modifications suck.  I'm a lil annoyed being a big fan and all. Seems like they have a bunch of amateurs working on this."
"Actually gotten worse with each update. Unplayable online, and in-game crashes and FPS lag is beyond ridiculous for a game from the 20th century and carted over to systems that are probably 50x more powerful. A crying shame, avoid."
"Don't waste your money. The game has the same potential of the old one but it's completely messed up, the game is completely lagging, unplayable in multiplayer. They just added some civs, some new maps and new technology but the game engine is totally messed up.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/221380/discussions/2/828935673161651486/#p3  take a read before buying"
I love this game but it seems the performance gets worse and worse. They are coming out with an african exspansion but i will be very hesitant to buy it unless i see some performance issues addressed. I do not understand why a 20 yr old game is constantly laging out or going out of sync with 8 players. Its not like were playing a brand new game with super graphics and 64 plyrs in the room. Please fix Our Awesome Game.
This game is great when it's NOT FREEZING. That's twice now it's frozen in the middle of a huge battle towards the end of a game. Just feel like I've wasted 2 whole hours for nothing. Do yourself a favor and just get the original. This version has issues.
"A classic, poorly remade. Very buggy, not really what I'd consider 'hd' as you could have downloaded a widescreen fix for the original and have the same graphical fidelity. Multiplayer is really laggy, and there's no improvements in any of the gameplay mechanics. They should have left AOE 2, to the 5 year old me and not refresh the game with this garbage! Players constantly leave, game constantly desyncs, game will freeze for a few minuites due to somone lag spiking....."
Cmonn fix the online its too laggy i cant eaven play a game without dropping atleast 1 player. if you want too play online dont buy this game is not worth
"I love AoE 2, and the 1080p/1440p is truly great. But the framerate drops so low it's unplayable when too many units are on the move (regardless of CPU/graphics power). It's so disappointing... I really hope it's fixed soon, but until then, I'd stay away (especially for the price). I was so happy that AoE 2 was being revived, but perhaps it's best to play the original so that it runs smoothly."
"A considerable improvement over the bland and limiting AoE III, its predecessor is still well behind my current standard for CivBuilder RTSs, Empire Earth II. Playing much more like the skirmish-based RTSs which I avoid for their overly-aggressive tedium, AoE II is rather poorly paced, with AI opponents advancing in Age inside of ten minutes, setting hordes of troops on my head while I'm still figuring out the local geography. While some might just attribute this to me not being very good, I would attribute it more to me playing the wrong game.  I suppose for those who like that sort of pacing I can recommend this game, as mechanically I am pretty satisfied with it, with only its poor pacing and relatively short match length the killing points for me. I might still play it from time to time but for now, I'm still waiting on a civbuilder that can meet my standards of pacing and freedom."
"Very lag, Even with the moden computer to play a kind of old game. When population grows, its very lag. And even use 500mB internet speed, it still got 2000 ping.  NOT RECOMENED"
"An amazing game, but there are so many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs, it makes the game practically unplayable."
"It's a decent game, even though my computer's got a tendency of getting the 'Blue Screen of Death' every time I try things like increasing the number of opponents... It worked well back in the days when I used it on a Windows 98 machine, but with Windows 7, the gaming experience tends to get a little... annoying..."
wow  such bugs  much unplayable  very lag  wow
"Steam workshop support is awesome, but that's the only benefit to buying this. If you're thinking about getting this for the online play (like I was) you're going to be extremely disappointed. Matchmaking is buggy and doesn't work very well, and even when you get into a game there is a high chance you'll experience crippling lag that makes the game basically unplayable. Save your money and play online with your old AoE CD with voobly or gameranger..."
"Stirring up nostalgic memories this game might, but after being used to other games for a decade, this game doesn't age well. And it is hardly HD, main menu looks like crap, menu hasn't even slightly been touched to reflect newer systems.  Once you finally play it you will also be saddened to realise that it just isn't that good. 2 Guards and 5 archers, to take down one wolf?   I wish I could remove games from my collection forever, alas, like The Ship, this will be on my games list until I die."
"Can't recommend this game its just has too many bugs, lag, and over all very poorly optimised for modern computers, they are suppose to fix this I've read but been out for years and this far its gotten some bug fixes but over all optimization still very bad.  Rather get the classic version with a few easy obtainble mods and its better than this HD release also with full resolution support and what not, for that reason this game isnt worth picking up on heavy discount even."
It doesn't really hold up. Campaign is really grindy and slow. Newer games have all the same features but are slicker and better put together.
There's nothing HD about this. It's the old game with no graphic overhaul whatsoever. The engine feels slow and clunky. I don't remember the original one being this hard to play. I would avoid this one unfortunately. Could have been great.
It's pretty dank.
"Nice nostalgia trip... but don't get too excited about the population level increase. I experienced game killing framerate drops in games approaching the 500 population limit... and considering games like Cossacks: Back to war allow for 10's of thousands of units on the map (another vintage title) I have to say I'm a bit disapointed. I spent 100's of hours playing this gem over 10 years ago, and it was a nice trip down memory lane, but even the map editor lags. Just very disapointed in game performance.   My system is 4 years old: Intel core i7 950, 12 gigs of ram, 120 gig corsair SSD &amp; dual Radeon 6870's.   I originally played this game on a Dell w/ a pentium 3."
"Age of Empires II is one of the best games of all times. But playing this online is at the best of times a joke. Matchmaking is still done by buggy 90s technology, central matchmaking is non-existen, disconnects in every game are the rule"
"Nice game for real-time strategy enthusiast :) lovely HD version,couldn't be happier to have it in HD of my childhood favourite game."
"This is one of the best RTS's of all time, and until version 4.x it was a fantastic remake for modern systems. Unfortunately, 4.x messed around too much and now it's pretty broken. Most mods that worked with previous versions won't work any more and there are no available workarounds other than manually editing game files. So mod support is pretty much useless other than cosmetic mods. Any mods that make changes to mechanics (like resources, population, units, etc.) require convoluted procedures.  Also, the game will no longer let you create custom MP matches by yourself. Before, you could always go into Multiplayer and host a game against AI, and set it up however you wanted, but now you get an error 'You cannot start a game with only one player.' and it won't let you start the game. Single player won't let you customize the number of opponents or anything like that.  The game is pretty much broken. The original HD version was fantastic, but the developers kept fiddling and making things worse and worse, and I can no longer recommend this."
Was working fine but the forced update broke it wont run.. When are you guys going to learn to leave well enough alone. Its so frustrating!!!!
The graphics don't look HD to me and the game has a severe lag (even on a 8gb quad with titan graphic card).  I don't recommend the game and I am sorry I got it.  Hope they will fix this soon... (but it is doubtfull)
Multiplayer runs like complete crap
"The gameplay and music are straight from 1999 but luckily the graphics aren't in this brand new, up to date, riveting HD remake. It's so HD, the resolution is about 800x600, that's 600p for you uninitated folk.  Had this remake came out in 1999, it might have been acceptable, but some 15 years later, you're better off getting two jars of honey and using a spoon and dobbing it on the ground and hoping that two warring tribes of ants try and take control of their honey kingdom and attempt to conquer the other. Worst case, you can try and lick the honey, crushing ants in the process and possess the delusion that you are a god.  AoE 2 High Definition. More like Hard Donkeys.  Edit: I came out in 1992 and no there wont be a HD remake unfortunately. This is why I can judge based on only 1 hour of play time. Would I play more of this amazing game? Perhaps if I get a time machine, take it to 1998, sing with Ricky Martin and try and impress Richard Nixon that I have a video game from 1999."
"I can't even play the game. I managed to get it to launch. But in the game it's very laggy and after a few seconds sprites turn black and then the game crashes. I have a really good pc with windows 7- 64 bit, i7 proc, GTX780, Xonar Phoebus. I really want my money back since i cannot even play."
would lovetobe able to play the game but after a few seconds it just crashes to the desktop with no error msg.

"It's AoE 2 with a HD resolution fix. Not really much else to say about it. The game is priced terribly unfortunatley. Really, $20? The sad part is some saps were conned into buying this because they can't let go of their nostalgia. Buy it on sale if the game interests you or you want to relive your youth. Otherwise stay away."
"Dear Developers,  is Age of Empires from 1999 a good game? - Yes, indeed! is the Age of Empires HD Edition from 2013 a good remake or rebirth of a game to fit it into modern gaming environment and its usual 18€ (~ $20) worth? - No!  Why? I expect different minimum aspects of a game or remake product what costs this price:  - New/Improved graphics - OK, nice work! - Workshop, Modern Features &amp; New Content - OK, but most came from the community! - Work on bugs etc. - Yes, work is still in progress, I'll come later to this point! - New/Improved Interface - Nearly no changes - Fluently gameing, even in multiplayer - NOPE (!!!), every (regional!) game has a latency which is not acceptable for such an old game (or better REMAKE!) with such low system requirements! (1.2 GHz, 1 GB RAM, DirectX 9.0 ?!)  The last point is the most important. Have you seen the Stronghold Crusader HD Patch? Have you seen this project:  http://www.openra.net/  ? New graphics, new content, this does not help anything until I can't play fluently without connection problems in every second or third game and constanly latency issues... You are not able to solve these problems? Okay, but then tell it to the customers and furthermore declare it in the shop describtion and finally don't expect 18€! (Hint: The other remakes are for free!!!)  I appreciate your work on this game goes on, but after the last 4.0 update I do not understand what you are doing with the code all day? I've got a glass fibre with 100 Mbits with an average latency of 5 ms. Every other game, even older ones with a more challenging graphic works fluently. I don't think this is a problem of my connection. My computer has enough power to manage games like Crysis, this is not the eye of the needle, too. So, I don't understand what you have done during the last years since its new release?  Luckily, I didn't spend too much trust into a Microsoft licensed development, and I just paid my 3.79€ during a summer sale a while ago. So, until the developers of AoE2HD does not improve these performance issues, I cannot recommend to pay anything for this!  I do not wanna be impolite, but at the moment I remember this about the CS:GO development:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjvNMhRt4NI  Some may get the same feeling about this remake!  Best regards and break a leg!"
This game is the ♥♥♥♥.
"Bought the game to play with friends, and the Multiplayer doesnt work, everyone gets disconnected ever few minutes, you cant enjoy more than 15mins of playtime properly, and the restore system doesnt work at all either.  I asked for a refund, but aparently i spent more than 2 hours trying to fix this awfull insult to customers and fans,  Save your money, or buy Age of Empires 3 separately, because AOE2 HD is a robbery."
  Just a poorly made rehash of the original.   You can get a patch to make the original cd version work on Windows 10. Just search around
Can you roll the update back in fix the ♥♥♥♥ing problems with the game?  You've gotta be joking with this latest one right?
"If you wish to play Online with friend DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME, its been years and they still havent fixed the multiplayer lag, it just simply doesnt wanna cooperate, youll have to wait 5-15 seconds to move any unit, single player works fine but multiplayer is a no go, if they fixed this then itd be 10/10"
"AoEII is one of my favorite RTS games of all time. I remember foaming at the mouth looking at preview shots of the game before it came out. All things considered, I cannot recommend the HD edition as it is. This game has horrible performance issues that makes it almost unplayable at a point. Even if you're playing a single player game the game will start to stutter a great deal once more units are on the map. In one of my games I alone had around 300 units on the map and the game was lagging so hard (single player) that my computer frequently marked it as non-responsive. The computer I play it on will run many of the latest games at full settings while doing several other resource-intensive things without any performance issues. This version of the game, however, begins to ♥♥♥♥ itself when barely warming up. I keep playing it because I always loved this game, but honestly my old 667 ran this game better than my much newer and much more powerful computer I use today. This is a very poor re-release of a great game."
"What's to say....hmm...  Well first off, it's a must have. The single player and multiplayer are too fun to pass up (aside from the MP lag). Alot of people prefer this one over the 3rd, but I love all of them.  This one offers alot more then the 3rd, so one could say to play the 3rd before the 2nd. But I am recommending you play every single AoE game, and not leaving your parent's basement till you beat single player on all of them. Ok? Ok.  Best RTS of all time. 5 out of 5 Acorns.  P.S. BUY THE LEGACY BUNDLE!!!!!"
"this game is broken. The game still lags 30 seconds in larger size maps. None has had a chance to build 500 archers 30 seconds into the game, but it still lags.  FIX IT MICROSOFT!"
"No point in buying this game just for the wide-screen fix, also multiplayer sucks ♥♥♥ with not many lobbies and constantly bad connectivity.   Also the game developers expect You to fix your router settings to fix NAT forwarding bullcrap that does not appear with any other Valve games.  Don't buy this out of nostalgia, not worth it."
"It's the classy AoE2 you know and love with minimal changes, online multi support added in and a fairly high asking point.  Hard to recommend this to anyone as most gamers would have played it already, and can get it cheaper elsewhere. There is a variety of mods made for this game already, with extra expansions that don't ask you to fork over cash for a DLC."

The game lags way too much.. After a quick search only I`ve found that many players seem to have experienced this problem for years. Truly a waste of money and a shame that it`s still for sale.
"A waste of money. Don't buy it, unless you really want to see a barely improved version from the original."
Awesome game but I've experienced major lag problems in online play. It runs perfectly as a single player game. I hope the developers fix this issue.

"This RTS game is the best one of all-time to me. It was fun 15 years ago and still fun today. Very good gameplay, not too complicate, not too simple."
Campaign progress keeps starting over game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
Amazing game if you're willing to play '2 hours to die like this'.
A classic RTS game from the past that still has fun mechanics.
"It's a bit laggy, but it's a very nice game to play!"
"oh, the countless hours i've sunked into this game (while only 9.8 in steam, im sure i have 300+ hours in cd version i had).. Definetly worth it- has tons of content and replayability."
The game is great but unplayable because it runs like garbage. Please fix.
"Can't launch this damn game, either stuck on the loader or at the start of the game. Sometime i'm super lucky and get it work but the game is unplayable in multiplayer i got a damn 1000ms latency and reccurent freezes while other online games run perfectly"
awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"It's a bit laggy, but it's a very nice game to play!"
"If you enjoy RTS, then this is a great game. The blendind of eras from the times of the Crusades all the way up until basically New World Exploration, this medieval rts will put your skills to the test as you advance through time fighting your enemies over land and sea. Its just as I remember as a kid when I had LAN parties with friends, endless hours of fun. Works together warfare and city building in a very unique way with emphasis on research and single units (contrary to groups of units like in Total War Franchise) which I believes adds to the need for micromanaging abilities. Ummm, how do you turn this thing on again?"
"Laggy on my pc's, laggy as hell. It's a shame because the game itself would be nearly perfect."
"The game crush when i try to set gather point,,,  how can i fix it?"
I have an i5 with a $300 grafix card and... Low FPS? What the flying ♥♥♥♥? For a game that can run fine on my 15 year old computer? Inexcusable. I mean /really/ low fps. It's unplayable. What a rip off.
How to win against AI (any dificulty):  1st method.  Step 1 - Gather resources. Especially gold. LOTS of gold. Step 2 - Advance to the Castle Age. Step 3 - Build 5+ Monasteries. Step 4 - Build a lot of houses. Step 5 - Research every technology you can for monks. Step 6 - Advance to the Imperial Age and repeat Step 5. Step 7 - Make an army of monks. Step 8 - Wololo any opponnent.  2nd method.  Step 1 - Press 'Enter' to pop open the chat bar. Step 2 - Write 'how do you turn this on' and press 'Enter'. Step 3 - Repeat steps 1 and 2 more than 100 times. Step 4 - Obliterate any opponent with Cobra Cars.  10/10 would wololo cobra cars again.
"I remember back when this came out I was just a early teen and it was my favoruite game, I used to play 1v1 Deathmatch on some 3rd party website where there was ratings to see who was the best. They also had many other game modes that were hell fun. Archer wars or and tower wars were fun. multiplayer games were fun.. if anyone could refresh my memory what website that was thatd be cool.  If they could fix the lag I woulc play the game wput playing with 200 ping every game is no fun and I regret buying this game"
""
Wood please.
"Don't waste your money, I much prefer the free user patch available on the net for the original than this game. They've broken more than they've fixed and promised more than they've delivered. I only play it because its the version my friends play."
"One of the great classics of its genre. For me Age of Empires II is one of the best games of all time and I must've poured hundreds upon hundreds of hours in this game since it came out.   I must add, I'm not a Multiplayer person. I'm playing it for the Singleplayer portions and the scenario editor where I spend a lot of time coming up with ideas for new scenarios.   Really liked The Forgotten expansion and I look forward to playing The African Kingdoms as well."
"Could not believe my eye, much HD"

I started out with all male villagers and somehow was able to get a female villager at the town center.   10/10- would force men to bang more   11/10- helps single life
"Best game EU.  Nothing more, nothing less"
0/10 this game never actually tells me the Age of these Empires.
"I loved growing up playing this game. I couldn't get enough and it really made me fall in love with the RTS genre...that being said, this port is horrible. Constant bugs and slowing without remorse. It's so freaking annoying. The game seems smoorth until the battles start commencing. Then, the sluggish side to side scrolling and grouping takes over and you're pretty much dead to rights when you play any kind of RTS without the quick response. It's sad, I really wanna recommend this game, but I just can't. Also, considering that these 'developers' that have taken control of the series are just making crap ontop of crap and not fixing the glaring needs to the game, just disgusts me that much more. I could honestly care less about new teams. New campaigns is always nice! But fix your ♥♥♥♥. Make it run smooth, or don't bother at all."
Buy it.  Now
"If you want the AoE experience, look elsewhere. This HD remake is very underwhelming.   -Graphical issues across the board, and generally the HD polish does not help the game look less dated. This seems to be a trend amongst companies making HD remakes; they never look good enough to justify a repurchase in my opinion.  Overall just really disappointing, and I went back to playing my old CD-Rom version of AoE II."
"An oldschool awesome game, this is pretty new tho of the fact that its HD.... But the original Age of empires is pretty old, but it still does what it should.. very cool game to participate in, especially against friends! And freaking own them!.... Well i usually never win but its pretty fun anyway xd"
"I used to play this game a lot back in the day, it was a good game then. The upgraded graphics, resolution, and expanded game play make this game even better! Gameplay hasn't changed at all from the original, but instead of being capped at 200 populace, it can be set all the way up to 500! Battles and war are now epic in size... the new DLC available also looks promising.  All-in-all, if you are a fan of RTS titles, this is an instant classic. I bought the four pack and sent it to friends that remembered playing years and years ago. Glad this game got an HD reboot!"
"No no no. Do NOT buy. The game will not work on most Windows machines past XP, and forget 64-bit OSs. You'll get arcane errors like 'Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw.' What is this, the 90s? That ♥♥♥♥ came out prior to DX9, so everyone with a reasonably modern machine should have that installed.   If this crappy port to modern machines can't figure out where Microsoft hid the DX9 and higher files in their newer OS, then maybe I should take up reverse engineering and decompile the code on this bad boy for a look-see.   Long story short, don't buy it. It'll make you wish Bill Gates had suck-started a shotgun instead of dropping out of college."
"This is basically just the game many of us played years ago... with updated terrain and a re-scaled UI.  All of the issues from the original game are still there, such as pathfinding, unbalanced upgrades, and an ugly interface.  So while this game is great for the brilliant variation in units, and the great strategy, it is still full of issues, plus some more that were introduced just for this edition, which you will certainly find via a google search.  No new features were introduced, apart from the expansion's addition of a few map options.(you can now get extra huge maps, though this is barely a major feature)  This means there is still no building rotation, no grids, and no new units.(except in the expansion, but they are unbalanced, and they are few)  Worst of all, considering the name of this edition: The textures have barely been upscaled, though they still look good, as the original did, there are no new graphic effects, and graphics options are still few, just as they were in the original. You can't even choose a custom resolution. The game defaults to your desktop's current resolution, which can be frustrating if you want to run the game in a window.  It would have been great if they'd at least swapped out the sprite graphics for 3D models, assuming they have the source code to make it possible, and it definitely would have been really great if they'd modified shadow rendering.(shadows in this game are poor)   Basically, if you still have the original game, like I did, don't bother with this, at least not until some major mods get made and released on the Workshop. If you've never played the original game and don't have a copy, then sure, buy this, but don't expect it to meet modern standards. It's always been a great game and it still holds up well, but it definitely needs some changes."
"I liked the game but there was so little content it wasn't worth 14.99 luckily i bought it before that but yeah, played through most of the campaingn(s) during 2 hours ish, it isn't as good as classic strategy's like Caesar III &amp; II which i would spend days on anyway it's like 5.4/10 for me, like the game is fun but the graphics suck but thats normal but even for a game like this they could of worked harder :/ the lack of customisation pains me, you can't really choose a style for your buildings you're set to have your race's one it's all about war none about economy and stuff and the lack of female character spawns is like oddly low i aint no feminist so ur safe but still. There are alot better out there."
"I will probably try the game again but at the moment, I find the actual GUI/animations so bad it's hard for me to get into. I'm sure it's a great game if you get into it early but its hard for me to like it..even after liking AOE3."
Terrible performance on a pc which should have no problems running this.
"This game was fine for the time it was made but now it is so ghetto. The AI is horrible - don't bother trying to control your units in battle, it only makes them fight worse."
"Awful. it's unplayable, get Age of Empires II instead, do not buy the HD - waste of money."
"frame rate problem with modern pc, unplayeble online lag problem, and no difference with the original AoE 2. 18,99$ are too much for no changing"
"AoE 2 is a great game and like many others I was ready for this game when it landed and excited to play against others in Multiplayer. They have not improved the lobby system or multiplayer system what-so-ever and it's atrocious. Getting a game to start will most likely never happen, and their 'ranking' system of placing a number next to your name that other players can see is the dumbest concept ever executed in matchmaking.  If you're expecting to play this game with other people easier than the original AoE 2 or think it's anything like Starcraft 2 or CSGO matchmaking you are entirely wrong. If your goal is to spend some time playing actual games of AoE 2 instead of waiting in lobbies, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck, sorry."
its a fun game but on steam is has so many bugs... its very annoying
"RTS perfection by Ensemble Studios.   This HD edition is nothing spectacular, it adds support for various modern resolutions, multiplayer that works. While that doesn't sound like much, it probably is, but maybe it isn't, I have no idea.   The price-tag on this VERY old game is absurd, coupled with the fact that there's a price-tag on a DLC which was initially free and developed by fans. It feels greasy.  But in the end, this is Ensemble Studios' good old Age of Empires, with a few improvements made here and there to accomodate our modern needs and that jolly multiplayer part. I really, really want to recommend it, but not at full price.  Get it on discount and spam some ♥♥♥♥ing paladins and longbowmen, you ♥♥♥♥.  "
"Step 1. Take a game from 1999, Slap a HD sticker on it and put it on steam. Step 2. Don't do anything to improve the performance issues of your title, Ever.  If your considering buying this game for anything more than 4 player multiplayer(This includes CPU players) i highly suggest looking up the performance issues.  This game drops down to 3fps regardless of machine running it when more players are playing.  What a joke."
I think I just missed the days of playing this game online when I was a kid so I picked it up. The original Starcraft aged better than this so its hard for me to recommend it.

No new features were introduced, apart from the expansion's addition of a few map options.(you can now get extra huge maps, though this is barely a major feature)  This means there is still no building rotation, no grids, and no new units.(except in the expansion, but they are unbalanced, and they are few)  Worst of all, considering the name of this edition: The textures have barely been upscaled, though they still look good, as the original did, there are no new graphic effects, and graphics options are still few, just as they were in the original. You can't even choose a custom resolution. The game defaults to your desktop's current resolution, which can be frustrating if you want to run the game in a window.  It would have been great if they'd at least swapped out the sprite graphics for 3D models, assuming they have the source code to make it possible, and it definitely would have been really great if they'd modified shadow rendering.(shadows in this game are poor)   Basically, if you still have the original game, like I did, don't bother with this, at least not until some major mods get made and released on the Workshop. If you've never played the original game and don't have a copy, then sure, buy this, but don't expect it to meet modern standards. It's always been a great game and it still holds up well, but it definitely needs some changes."
WTF is wrong with it it crashes everytime i start playing im new to steam n tryed everything to get this to work i am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ i am not ever ganna recommend steam to anyone shouldve listend to my friends steam is such bull ♥♥♥♥

"It never works. It just says: preparing to launch, running, syncing and then nothing happens :( . Help"
Years after release this game still has unsolved issues with slowdowns and lag in multiplayer. None of the patches have truly fixed it and it renders the game unplayable. So sad that a game that worked perfectly smooth in the 1990s is slower now even on modern machines.
Oodles of content and so low spec it could run on a PS4.
i like to be the muslims and make petards and blow ♥♥♥♥ up allahu akbar
"Very fun, I only have a few hours in it, around 17 but I think its a wonderful game. It was my frist steam game I ever had, but when I was younger I had no clue how to play it, but now I do, so I have been playing it so much ever since then. Great game to buy, its worth to buy."
"Still laggy ♥♥♥ H¤% . Its a shame that its so laggy game and cant use attack move like 'a' Archers = Win , to hard for any micro, with this system and lagg."
"AoE 2 is a great game and like many others I was ready for this game when it landed and excited to play against others in Multiplayer. They have not improved the lobby system or multiplayer system what-so-ever and it's atrocious. Getting a game to start will most likely never happen, and their 'ranking' system of placing a number next to your name that other players can see is the dumbest concept ever executed in matchmaking.  If you're expecting to play this game with other people easier than the original AoE 2 or think it's anything like Starcraft 2 or CSGO matchmaking you are entirely wrong. If your goal is to spend some time playing actual games of AoE 2 instead of waiting in lobbies, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck, sorry."
"This game was so awesome. The HD version was just as good as the original if not better. A few years ago. I don't know what happened, but now it does not work at all. It either won't launch or crashes constantly. What a pitty. This game is so good. Steam isn't worried about it I guess."

"*really sad they went to voobly and ripped all the community work, repackaged it... changed the keys to anything but the original.... and offer a really poor copy of this fantastic game... even worse - they stole the forgotten again from the community and now profit from it.  My advice - find a copy of the original game google Voobly aoe... and play on there hundreds more people to play against.... more traditional replica MSN gaming network interface.  this is the worst version of aoe u will ever play."
"wtf, okay this isnt about the game itself but.... the devs have locked everyone out of forums so no help for any issues i bought the aoe2hd+forgotten dlc and the dlc is nonexistant. in singleplayer i have standard, conquorers and age of kings.. no forgotten..  seriously with the forums WTF guys"
"Do you remember when you got the copy from a friend's friend of this game, linked it up via Hamachi and I don't know what? Yea... that worked better than this version.   5/10; Graphics are okay, sounds as always, the new tribes..well, you don't neet them, but they're there (imho); gameplay: Since it's a multiplayergame which's been messed up....I don't recommend AOE2HD"
"i bought this game to play with my bro but i couldnt start it, theres always some error preventing me to play a game on both machines i have....  On my netbook with windoes 7 i had an error 3 saying that my gpu didint supported shadders 3.0, wich is false, it doens support it, i then tried to use swiftshader and got the error 1, i guess i couldnt use my net book.  I then tried with my normal laptop that is running win xp, i download the game again and tried to play, got another error, my gpu had some issue and couldnt run direct draw or something....  Really??!  THE ORIGINAL WORKED ON BOTH COMPUTERS DAMMIT  The last time i had incompatibilities and errors like these, i was still using an single core pentium...  The original version &gt; hd version."
Lan is a must in this game or it is a dudd.
Guys... i bought this thinking it was going to bring back the old glory days of AOE... Got it and was shaking with anticipation... only to find out they ruined my favorite game of all time by Screwing up the servers. 4 second lag on any command and when you do play the community thats left has custom made maps that play the advantage Extrememely to the makers side. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! WASTE OF $20 AND RINED THIS GAME FOREVER FOR ME!!
"This game was fine for the time it was made but now it is so ghetto. The AI is horrible - don't bother trying to control your units in battle, it only makes them fight worse."
"Awful. it's unplayable, get Age of Empires II instead, do not buy the HD - waste of money."
"It never works. It just says: preparing to launch, running, syncing and then nothing happens :( . Help"
"Age of Empires II is the very first video game I ever played and it remains my favorite game till today. The aesthetics, history, complexity of this game had me hooked to it for nearly 15 years. And this new HD version obviously kept all the original games charm since it's virtually the same. But there are a few very nice new features that I enjoyed immesely.  What I like best about the HD version is the steam workshop support. Mods can be conveniently applied to the game, I had a few graphic textures installed to my version and it totally revitalized the experience.  The Forgotten expansion is a bit rough on the edges in the beggining, but with almost a monthly update it is getting better and better. In time I think all the new content added to the game, such as new civilizations, new campaigns, new units would match the quality of the first expansion: the Conquerors.  I have never played multiplayer in the past, now with steam support I did try a few games, and it is very user friendly to say the least, I might do that more in the future.  In summary what I love about this game and this HD version is that it brought a ture classic game back to life, it brought a generation of gamers who love this game together. I would recommend this game to anyone who have played AOE2 in the past, who is open-minded to classic strategy games, and people who love ancient civilizations. Age of Empires 2 is one of those rare experience that never grows old and keeps getting better. No game has ever impacted me as much and no other game ever will."
always loved this game so glad i can still play it 
"The graphics are bad, the units are simple, and online lags hard sometimes, but this is a perfect RTS. You must choose upgrades carefully and produce just the proper units at just the proper time. This isn't about flash, it's about strategy.  If you do purchase this, check out some guides first. Otherwise, you just might get pummled.  10/10 - a timeless masterpiece"
"Let me start off by saying this game is just as fun as the old one, and if u dont like the new 3D features you can turn them off or install mods to make it like the first one. Anyways this game is one of my all time favorite games, (most) campaigns are exciting, the mulitiplayer is a bit laggier then by yourself but thats exepected and you adjust pretty quick to it. I have spent countless hours on this game and the old version made in the 90's and its always something new everytime i play, now with the forgotten this game is a must buy and trust me u do not need a great computer to run this, i have a friend who only has 2GB of ram and it runs very well. To conclude this review, i want to say that i would buy it now during the christmas sales before its gone. TY and if u buy it i hope you enjoy :D"
"Best Retro game ive played, its really fun."
"Worth getting. Especially the Forgotten Wars DLC campaigns are well-made. Personally I find it dull that you have to build all the buildings over-and-over again everything you start a new map, but that belong to the RTS genre, I guess?"
I have a PC running Windows Vista that has been fully updated and I constantly get a messge saying 'Unable to initalize graphics system. Your GPU hardware may not meet the minimum system requirements. Subcode=3.' The 'Contact Support' button takes me to the Age of Empries website which has nothing to do with Steam. I paid $24.99 for this and I can't even play it nor is there any hint of wanting to help fix the problem from Steam. I have read the forums (unfortunately after I paid for the game) and it seems like a ton of people have this issue.   Don't be a fool like be and DON'T BUY THIS GAME!  Silly me thinking that something I bought from Steam would work like it was supposed to...
Goths
THEY RUNIED THE GAME! Put it back the way it was There was no lag there was no probolms there was no crashing Im going back to DISC! this is freaken Rediculuse the campains are laggin my computer I never had probolms till the update crap and Now I got all kindas of probolms PUT THE GAME BACK THE WAY IT WAS! By the way the new civls are crashing the game cause the game cannot support that graphic of the building and the new soliders and the old soilders yes it may work but its crashing my game after a 1hr of gameplay I crash I should be able to play 24-7 if I needed to I used to do youtube vidoes but I cant now.
HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON
"Absolutely brilliant game, one of the best purchases I've made on Steam so far. A large part of my childhood in a folder. ;D"
"Very goos RTS, very easy to learn how to play"
why is the standerd game not loading up 
love it childhood favorate reborn
Best played with friends.
Best strategy game out there according to my opinion. I'd be really happy if the developers would take some time to update the graphics and add more different unit lines in a future version of AoE4! :)
"The game is pretty much a remake, which isn't bad, but there are bugs that bother me which you didn't have in the old game. If you play the game solo it's solid. However as soon as you start setting up multiplayer games you end up with bugs and ♥♥♥♥s. First of all if I try to choose full random(which exists 2 times in the list for no proper reason) the game gives me some error and crashes afterwards. Then if you finally launched your game with friends, you start to play for a great period of time having fun, but then suddenly the game crashes without any error message on all pcs of the people that were in the game. Sadly no restoration point either, I remember getting them in the old aoe2 when something happened. Now the other bad point I have is that the game starts to lag with bots, you get freezes depending on what the bot is trying to do, for example I had a bot on multiplayer that closed out his army in the forest with a wall, since he couldn't find a path but was aggroed it started to lag on my pc. These are glitches I didn't have on the old aoe2 and since they are really fatal I can't recommend the game in the state it is right now. If you're just going for singleplayer you can give it a try. Now take my salt :DDD."
"5/7 Reminds me of my childhood, except on steroids"
.
Be me  Build a giant army and explore the whole map  Feel Good  See Economy is doing pretty well  Buy a lot of walls for defense  Attack enemy  Sees guard towers  Gets scared  Lose half of your army destroying mill  Despise mills for life  Notice i have no guard towers  Watch enemy come  Watch enemy attack  Lose the rest of your army  Lose troop training buildings  Lose           8/8 Best mill despising game of all time!
hey that's pretty good
"I feel like I should write some review to convince you to buy this, but I won't. You know what this game is and I know why you're here, to look at reviews and find a funny one. Well, too bad, this isn't such a review. It's just here to fill in the up votes of the game"
THIS GAME..... just is soooo fun. i love it i have played 300h of this. is is good  but wach a vid or two to know what you are doing
WOuld not save my campaign progress. Could hardly play it.
"For the past few weeks, my game tries to update, but will not complete the process. It continues to say, 'An error has occurred during updating.' In essence, I cannot play the product. I've attempted contacting their support staff but there has been no reply. DO NOT RISK PURCHASING THIS GAME. IT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU."
When its called Age of Empires II HD i thought it was HD xd
I really loved the first one :/ this is just a sad buggy up mark of the best game ever made
I actually have thousands of hours in this game but Steam doesn't take my hours from the CD version into account. Thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
boring
Like Strategy building god like games? OR played aoe 3? GET THIS its awsome and fun :D 8/10
"AoE 2 has been my favorite RTS ever since it first came out. The campaign is time-consuming and interesting, while you can also play custom games or multiplayer with friends/AI. The battles can be huge, and yet, the outcome can never quite be certain on the harder difficulties.  I definately recommend playing this game with or against friends if you can."
"Gameplay-wise, here it is; the game you enjoyed (and probably have continued to enjoy) for a decade. The game plays exactly as it used to, it'll be perfectly familiar if you've played the original.  Graphically, we're not looking at much, the water looks a little better, and that's about it. Besides that, they simply added more resolutions. You can play in your native resolution, and if that is technically HD (1600+) then this is AOE 'HD.' There are, however, plenty of wonderfully made graphic upgrades in the Steam Workshop, and if you need a fresh look, then I highly recommend you check them out.  Matchmaking works well enough, and has gotten better as they have upgraded the game, lag so far has been quite minimal, and the talent field is, well, talented. If you're looking for a good challenge, be sure to get in some online matches.  All in all, I can't really complain. What it lacks in visuals it more than makes up for in being a perfect RTS. Still a 10/10"
This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥... can't believe all the trouble i am having playing with my father. The darn thing keeps on disconnecting and not letting us restore the game.... too bad i had such high hopes for this turd in hd.

"Played for 1 hour, Got killed for doing the objective, Raged from the game, Game's ♥♥♥♥. I REPEAT DONT PLAY BY OBJECTIVE OR YOU WILL GET REKT. WONDERS GET YOU KILLED! 10/10 WILL BUILD WONDER AGAIN."
"Reminds me of the original AOE 2, but i don't remember the game crashing and erasing my scenarios back in 2006. Lost hours of building, pathetic."
"This is delicious vintage 90s RTS. Get it if you like Warcraft II or Starcraft.  A few things that stand out to me in AOEIIHD. The first is massive groups of units, the second is how they can be crushed with very effective area of effect attacks. The gameplay itself is very fast-paced and challenging; if you're finding yourself waiting around when playing you aren't playing right: this game will challenge you to complete as many actions as possible as quickly as possible. The maps have a good variety and unique challenges for the players.  The game includes a non-military victory option, wherein you build a 'wonder' and a timer counts down from 250. I have mixed feelings about this mechanic. On one hand it gives a 'multiple routes to victory' flavor like the Civilization series, but on the other hand it encourages a very defensive playstyle, which might work against the AI, but will leave you very poorly prepared for multiplayer matches, which are still very popular. Did I mention resource gathering and management is constant and frantic? It is and it's awesome.  I don't feel comfortable rating this game on a number scale. It's a classic RTS from the 90s, like Warcraft 2 or Starcraft, with a world flavored like the Civilization series. If this game has one flaw it is that the developers made the different factions too similar (this game is not Starcraft), but to make up for this there are maybe forty of them, all with unique units."
10/10 would get nostalgic again
"It's a good game, don't get me wrong but this version is plagued with so many damn bugs and issues and the workarounds are so elaborate and don't even necessarily keep working that I just don't think it's worth it... I spent more time trying to get it to run than actually playing it. The multiplayer is just screwed up. A real shame but don't waste your money. Go with AoE3 instead."
"Good game, used to play when i was younger :D For me personally it's better than AoE 3. Was happy to find it on here so i could get to play again :)"
One of the best games I have played

If you had like this game when it first came out you will love it even more now. Everything in hd in this classic and age of mythology. Both good game's you should pick up (if you didn't already!)
Great strategy game.

"this game is govno  reseeding farms isnt automatic pathfinding doesnt work shiftclicking doesnt work rally points do not work soldiers go through an army of enemies who are attacking them without giving a ♥♥♥♥ ^all this ♥♥♥♥ makes you do unessesary micro which doesnt help anyway, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soldiers still have to think about meaning of life for like 5 seconds before attempting to do what they were ordered ai stops thinking after an hour or so villagers cost unreasonably a lot so it makes you have to spend like 40 minutes setting up economy just to be able to produce troops in adequate quantities fanboys get butthurt over my reasonable complaints  this game is 6 million years old and all this crap still isnt fixed rise of nations is better"
This is an epic RTS game its really fun to play with friends or vs. AI

"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
Kinda and old game(3 years old) but it still extremly good.I recommand it it extremly cool.

Why the ♥♥♥♥ does this game have 2D tag.  its 2.5D Get it rite scrubl0rds
expansion pack required. download dlc required. steam says* content downloaded i don't like it at all 
"If you are going to sell an HD remake, then it should look good. This most definitely does not."
"Quite disappointment since i am a big fans of AoE series. Game can not start and stuck on 'Validating subscription' pop up windows and force closed when i pressed ctrl + c.  Steam forum suggesting to add 'NOMODS' and 'SKIPINTRO' as launch options, it does clear out 'Validating subsctiption and mods' pop up windows but now it stuck on welcome screen with no menu clickable. Force closed upon random mouse click in welcome screen.  Uninstall - restart PC - and reinstall, still same result.  Issued refund request to steam to avoid further disappointment.  Installed on ASUS ROG GL552VW with latest driver updates + win10, so i guess it way beyond minimum spec for the game."
"I used to have a empire, then I took an arrow in the knee"
Way to many bugs. and even new oens come up when the old ones is stil there. if you play mutilplayer with friends it just get worse the more time you are in the game. the bigger the size of the map the worse the problems. the ai dont work like it should. the pathfinding is bad. its clunky and its stil not fix the lag issue.  and the dlc adds nothing more then bugs indstead of focusing on making the game better. The money is more worth it then the entire game  therefore i cant recomand the game before they fix it
"Dank game, PS2 Classic and i just finger myself over this stuff."
"THE GREATEST, MOST AMAZING GAME IS BACK now in HD for a small fee of $19,99  "
Just Started Glitching out of no where and levels won't load anymore. Help anyone?
"Age of Empires 2: HD Edition is a solid comback for the nostalgic strategy gamers and the new ones alike. This wonderful remastered version of the classic title has been catered to perfectly. The gameplay remains the same as it did so over a decade ago, which was important to be left alone; considering the fact it is perfectly balanced. Nostalgia and newcomers are welcome to this awesome strategy game, and for me this is a nostalgic viewpoint.   The graphics have been enhanced on multiple levels. The game engine still runs of the isometric and sprite based visuals, but they have been improved drastically with high resolution sprites and land. The water visuals have been also given a very nice look that is nothing like the old water. It has caustics and waves; reflection and the water looks more natural. One of the biggest perks to this remastered game is the native widescreen support. The older games featured some tolerance for widescreen through special editing; but this game runs flawless on widescreen and on triple monitors.  The gameplay is that of the original one as mentioned; none of the game mechanics or stats have been altered. I believe that this game's stats and mechanics should remain unchanged due to the fact it was made so perfectly.   Another great perk to AOE 2: HD is that multiplayer via internet is much much easier. Steam is used for server hosting; which means less pain for people to play together. In the old times; gamespy arcade was used mostly to play mutliplayer with AOE2. AOE2: HD also uses steam workshop, which is awesome because map uploads and mods can be obtained rather fast since most of them aren't too large in file size.

"It a really fun Game to play with if love old school games and the fact there workshop support in it make it very fun i play this when i was kid and i had great times with this beast what makes it fun is the way it works and how you must plan to attack your opponent to win the game and also it quite hard in cases like in the battle of hasting (which is a level in the game btw). if you love warcraft, starcraft, or the total war games then your going to have a fun time with this game."

"I have been playing AOE2 since the realise in 1999. However the new developers Skybox really suck at developing games, the ready screw up age of mythology, now they are gonna screw up AOE2.  - There is no LAN mode. - The campaigns from forgotten empires expansion onwards are broken - endless spawns, super diffcult missions, broken triggers etc.  - Multiplayer is too lag to even play, every single game has delay.  How I wish the developer was ensemble studio. They are the original creater and make good games."
Very dissapointed with this purchase (and I even got it on sale). Unplayable. I have a retina display and the units are so tiny you can't play it. There's no way to change the resolution in game. Changing OS resolution has no effect. I don't recommend spending money on this. I'm guessing no one will fix it and there are probably no refunds.
How do you turn this on  11/10
"My first Game in Pc , a relic ♥"
Better looking than me Good game though
the classic AoE2.  Delivers. Nostalgia. get it. Don't pay too much for it! It's a bit old..
delay in any game mode bye aoe.
Best RTS game i have played(because original version) but this HD version is bit broken compared to original game: if you want play multiplayer i suggest you download 'AoE II HD Compatibility Patch' so you can move to voobly and play againts original game users(you lose hd features wbile play patch. You don't need uninstall patch in order to play normal HD version in steam). Also skill rating is a lot higher + more people play custom scenarios.  +2000 hours in original game and more to come

"THE GREATEST, MOST AMAZING GAME IS BACK now in HD for a small fee of $19,99  "
"Dank game, PS2 Classic and i just finger myself over this stuff."
Way to many bugs. and even new oens come up when the old ones is stil there. if you play mutilplayer with friends it just get worse the more time you are in the game. the bigger the size of the map the worse the problems. the ai dont work like it should. the pathfinding is bad. its clunky and its stil not fix the lag issue.  and the dlc adds nothing more then bugs indstead of focusing on making the game better. The money is more worth it then the entire game  therefore i cant recomand the game before they fix it

"Great classic game. Horrible broken remake. Age of Empires 2 the original would run perfectly with max players even on my old super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer, but this piece of garbage even starts lagging when playing on original sized maps not to mention the two newer bigger sizes on which it will start to lagg even with just 4 players and 200 unit cap each. Just bad. Really bad. Unfortunetly it seems that this has become the norm though, even crappy looking small games nowadays may end up lagging like hell. I guess that's the result of the gaming industry being overrun by people who look to make a (small) fortune as quickly as possible instead of producing a enjoyable and 'original' working video game."
Two Words-Great Game
"I am extremely dissapointed. I love this game and spent many hours playing it when it years ago. I was pleased to see this new realease version and quite interested to see what the new AI is like since it got boring creating a million archers and mowing down everything.   Unfortunately, the resolution of my retina screen makes everything so small that the game is unplayable and there is no way to change the resolution of the game. This seems pretty micky mouse to me."
"The Multiplayer does NOT work. Its lagging ! (not the FPS) The connection, doesnt matter if you play on LAN its still lagging."
You pick it up after tens of years since it came out.  You try a match. You make some units.  You hear the priest go 'ululu'.  Then never pick it up again because its just boring.
"This 'game' is, without a doubt, the biggest rip off I have ever experienced in a purchase.The game is slow even on fast. All of the hotkeys have been changed, to represent God knowws what. The advertisement says improved AI. I say, 'What AI?' All in all, a total debacle. I want my money back"
Even more bugs than day one. Avoid this piece of crap
2/10 got knight rushed by original ai while trying to eco boom and lost
I picked this and the expansion up on Amazon for $3. Still wouldn't consider it worth it.
I bought this game a while back and it can never for the life of me run.....
TOP GAME :)
"It's a classic. I honestly don't notice the the whole 'HD' part, but the multiplayer is phenomally quick and easy to use. There are always servers up, no matter the time of the day.  Just like the old game. I reccomend it completely. :)"
Classic game.
played 20hrs of it and still finding new things to do.
"Age of Empires 2: HD Edition is a solid comback for the nostalgic strategy gamers and the new ones alike. This wonderful remastered version of the classic title has been catered to perfectly. The gameplay remains the same as it did so over a decade ago, which was important to be left alone; considering the fact it is perfectly balanced. Nostalgia and newcomers are welcome to this awesome strategy game, and for me this is a nostalgic viewpoint.   The graphics have been enhanced on multiple levels. The game engine still runs of the isometric and sprite based visuals, but they have been improved drastically with high resolution sprites and land. The water visuals have been also given a very nice look that is nothing like the old water. It has caustics and waves; reflection and the water looks more natural. One of the biggest perks to this remastered game is the native widescreen support. The older games featured some tolerance for widescreen through special editing; but this game runs flawless on widescreen and on triple monitors.  The gameplay is that of the original one as mentioned; none of the game mechanics or stats have been altered. I believe that this game's stats and mechanics should remain unchanged due to the fact it was made so perfectly.   Another great perk to AOE 2: HD is that multiplayer via internet is much much easier. Steam is used for server hosting; which means less pain for people to play together. In the old times; gamespy arcade was used mostly to play mutliplayer with AOE2. AOE2: HD also uses steam workshop, which is awesome because map uploads and mods can be obtained rather fast since most of them aren't too large in file size.

cheat engine for the win 10/10.
"AoE2 brought to modern times to run on your current PC without all the graphic glitches and problems you would get trying to play the old version from the CD.  There are some additions but the game remains AoE2 at the core. Its still fun, its still good. This is from when RTS games were good and didn't try to compete with RTT games, didn't try to be 'hardcore' competative, and were fun in general."
Best game ever! I've played it for years and I still have fun with it! WOLOLO
"I'm not full of nostalgia for this game and I really don't like this game.   In the RTS sense it's not that bad, but I have yet to play a match that wasn't dominated by crippling lag for the entire second half of the match.  The many different civilizations seem pointless as there are just a couple of races that dominate them all. The graphics are good for 1998, but dreadful for anything past 2004. The units get stuck a lot or just don't work like they're supposed to.  About the only part I like is the chat system where you can type in numbers and there are audible phrases that are produced."
9 out of 10 war elephants choose AoE2
"When clicking buttons, sound does not play with every clicks, it plays again until the first loop is finished. It sucks if you are trying to tell how many times you press the button by hearing its sound. Example: You pressed the hotkey to produce villagers, yet you only hear button pressing sound played twice, but you still can't tell how many times you pressed that key."
"DO NOT PLAY THIS ON TABLET OR NETBOOK!   I played the orignal one in a pentium 166mhz computer, and that was great. Now i want to play this on a quad core 1,6ghz intel atom tablet-netbook convertible mashine, and runs about 10-20 fps in energy saving mode, and 25-30 fps in high perfomance mode (i turned off some graphics setting) , How can this game so power hungry?! When i see the graphics i think this is the original with 16:9 resolution, so why 4x1,6ghz atom cpu is not enugh?"
its ♥♥♥♥
"Please steer awawy from this game. It is unplayable. You will experience massive server lag and random drops in 100% of your games. Ive been playing a....different version of this before it came out legit on Steam, it works much better. I bit the bullet, paid my 50 bucks and bought everything AOE HD related and it is unplayable. This is a great game, I love the updates, but it straight up does not function as a basic game."
not able to start game. being displayed as waiting for other players
10/10 Is a nice game.
The game does not scale to 4K. The option to change the resolution has been REMOVED in the HD version. Steam is not willing to refund this obviously broken game.

Must buy.   Just a few Wololos and you've won the game.  Wololo/Wololo  WOLOLO NATION!
It has excessive lag for no reason in most modes. The newer scenarios are super laggy and have low FPS. Menus are a bit bugged throuhout. For a 15+ year old game that used to run on anything it's sad that they've managed to break it to such a condition where it hardly runs on anything while only really adding a higher resolution setting. 
"I purchased this game last summer (2016) and played the Conquerors expansion a few times, but now I can't find it. I can play the regular Age of Empires II HD, but when I try to switch to Conquerors Expansion, I am told I need to purchase it. I go to the store, and see no options for purchasing it. I have some saved games that I played on Conquerors Expansion. What is going on? This is not fun."
:)
"After so many years I never actually stopped playing AoE2. Sometimes a year went by and I hadn't played a single match, but then I would put the disc back in and play for 2 months non-stop. Well, this is the new HD edition and it is pretty much the same game with some enhancements. Also the multiplayer is back.   AoE2 is one of the best strategy games ever made and it has stood the test of time. I still play it to this day even with all the new and flashy games that come out all the time. This says something."
"After all those years, still one of the best RTS you can play with a friend."

WoLoLo
I cannot runn this game at all
Needs constant internet connection.  I have played the original version of this game for years fine but now I 'upgrade' to the HD version it ♥♥♥♥ing closes the second I start a scenario.   There should be no servers needed for a single player game.
"Love, love, love, love this game.Very addicting once you stop being a noob. :)"
please tell me ... HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON?
Good game... but the lag is crippling.
"apparently HD means 'half-dead' because it still has ♥♥♥♥ resolution, they just did us a favor by removing the red glitter pixels and then slapped a $20 price sticker on it."
You would rather play the old version of AOE II than to waste your time playing a game that constantly lags
I picked this up in the summer sale. I really enjoyed playing AoE2 back when it first came out so when I saw the HD edition I snapped it right up! Unfortunately it doesn't stand up to my sepia tinted memory. The game gets very laggy in single player random maps. The computer no longer responds to mouse clicks so all I can do is pan about the map. Even the menus become unresponsive and I have to bring up the task manager to exit the game.  Very disappointing. (4/10)
Even more bugs than day one. Avoid this piece of crap
Probably the best game ever.
its back and its good!
My mouse keeps disappearing and my game crashes alot HELP!!
"Great game, must have strategy game"
"Cancerous game do not buy, multiplayer lobby doesnt work, needs ♥♥♥♥ing rework. Cancerous ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Getting cucked all day."
"Age of Empires II is one of the best RTS games ever created, remastered in HD. It has a new multiplayer system so you can play with friends across steam. (You don't need LAN) The only bad thing about the new edition, is that it unfortunately dose not work with the old version of the game (You can't play multiplayer with the old edition) and you can't install mods like Tales of Middle-Earth. Apart from that, its a great game and you will get hours of fun."

Right now this game is broken. Most users are reporting a total inability to even start the game.  It doesn't damn well work. And the devs are maintaining absolute head-in-the-sand silence about it.  Don't support this game as it is right now. Don't risk your wallet.
"Very Fun game if you are playing Single Player, holds up very well considering its age (Nostalgia helps too). But Multiplayer is Unplayable. Constant Freezes, DeSync and Input lag holds the game back. Even using Beta patches doesn't help at all. The original game actually runs smoother online than the current game. They need to address this lag before releasing new expansions."
"An awesome classic game. Terrible port. Saying that this ♥♥♥♥ is a 'HD' remake is a scam; they've done barely anything with the game and the worst part of all is that the network coding is ♥♥♥♥ing trash. Try playing a game online, laggy as hell. Ridiculous. Stay away from this if you intend to play it online."
I really love this game. But does the maker of HD 4.8b version do serious job? The multiplayer is laggy and even all the player from the same country has the laggy situation. This never happened in HD 4.7.  Please Please make all the changes carefully!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
'Right now this game is broken. Most users are reporting a total inability to even start the game.  It doesn't damn well work. And the devs are maintaining absolute head-in-the-sand silence about it.  Don't support this game as it is right now. Don't risk your wallet.'
Everytime they update your campaign progress is reset. Apparently this is an issue that has been around for years yet they continue to not fix it. No respect for thir customers or the time they put in.
"Buggy, slow or no bug fixes.. Was obvious its borderline unplayable because of bugs only after few hours of gameplay."
"You shouldnt call this HD.. graphics are almost same as 17years ago, very very small difference. Only good for some nostalgia"
Nothing really HD about this..
"I was very exited for this HD vertion, for all the cool graphics and new campains and such, and in that it did not disapoint me. in fact, I would say that if you are playing this for the single player buy it as soon as its on sale. However, there are still a lot of problems. my dad adores this game and wont play any other, he is playing it right as I type this. however its the old vertion, not this one, why? 3 reasons, there is a game breaking error that makes the play map all white. you can not click move or play at all. you would think for a computer that can run the old one just fine, it could most definatly run the new. of course, you likely wont have this issue, I just think it contributes to microsoft wanting a quick buck, or several bucks for that matter. $20? are you joking? you could go onto eBay right now and find the same game made in 1999 (I think) and buy it for 99 cents. 20 times less than this, so only buy it while its on sale. and finaly, the multiplayer is messed up. not only are there those 'out of sync' errors, but There is no LAN option. THIS GAME TOOK A STEP BACK!!! I dont expecialy like playing with online players with this game, expecialy when I had a father and an older brother who will play with me. this is very hard with no LAN support. you might say you can just use the regular internet, but then you encounter firewall problems and the info has to travel all the way to the google center in california and back just so you can see what the other person is doing who is sitting right beside you less than a foot away.  as far as I can tell, microsoft does not plan to update this game at all any more, and even if they do these problems likely wont be fixed by them. even with the graphical problems you get with the old game and windows 7, buy that one instead not the HD crap. its cheaper and better. microsoft made this for a quick buck and there is no denying it."
A once great game ruined by developer incompetence to the point where it is barely playable.
♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game how the ♥♥♥♥ do you break it so ♥♥♥♥ing often
"This game has the same out-of-date graphic without any options to change your resolution. It is extremely difficult to see each unit, the AI is extremely stupid, Microsoft has done NOTHING to improve this game. Don't waste your money on this."
Wololololololololo  Seriously you're missing out on the best game of the series. Armies of monks endlessly converting one another as masses of petards walk on by one another and do what they do best.  Its a classic that aged pretty damn well.
"Literally unplayable.  Pathfinding is insanely stupid, so that instead of walking straight from A to B units will move as if there were invisible walls.  Siege weapons are basically useless, I've tried the starting campaign (William Wallace) and it took literally 20 seconds to have the battering ram attacking the enemy castle or any other building, since they just kept wandering around or just positioning close to the target without ever beginning the attack.  I don't remember the original version being so dumb.  I used to love this game and play it for at least one month every year, so I took advantage of the summer sales to get the HD version, but it's not worth the 2,24£ I spent to get it.  Make it playable."
fun game if you LIKE GETTING FK'D IN THE A$$!  This game also produces a lot of sodium.
"Still a classic!  players still haven't changed since the early 2000's, yes they are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."
"This game is horribly optimized for newer systems. Out of three downloads my friends and I have experienced bugs every time. If you're going to remaster something, do it right."
"GAME DOES NOT SAVE. IF YOU LIKE GOING THROUGH WHOLE CAMPAIGN EVERY TIME, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU"
Step 1: Include 'Wololo' in your review. Step 2: ??? Step 3: Profit.
I was a fan of Age of Empire series. But after playing this. There is nothing good. Cossacks 3 is better option.
Not very much content.... It gets boring better to get rise of nations extended
This game is a rip off of Age of empires 2
"An HD remake of a great game. This game is old and the graphics even redone are outdated, but with the new Steam integration for online matchmaking it's really splendid! Some people who played the original call this the daddy of RTS. Maybe they are right. This is a good game."
"WTF is wrong with the people who made this game HD? The game lags horribly, no matter what you do, and they took away the option to tune down the graphics.  I can't even play single player now because of the lag. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Good thing I got a refund, and own the original copy of the game in physical form."

Game wouldnt even start. a lot of people have had this issue with no fix. get Age of Empires 3 instead!

"This is the same old AOE of old, with some minimum upgrade on textures and TERRIBLE PLAYABILITY.   This game is worthless, they removed everything that made AOC great:  - Perfect for lan parties: Now not only with no lan support, you CANNOT play on LAN. - Can play through internet if needed: They added lobbies, which is good, however game is UNPLABLE online. FPS will drop as low as 1-2 and EVERY SINGLE MATCH is totally unplayable. I can play Starcraft 2 at max grafics at 60fps, but it seems that they made some changes turning AOC HD into an unplayable game. - Can run on any computer: Terrible optimization, imposible to play online.    Overall, at least you can play the campaigns. But seriously, when i bought this game I though I would be able to play with my friends at lan parties or through internet, this IS NOT POSSIBLE on HD version, and they refuse to fix anything, or adding a LAN mode."
Writing while my loading screen got frozen. This game is unbelievable buggy.

I cannot paly the game. I used to be able to. Once I got a GTX 1080 something got screwed up. I love this game but I cannot paly it anymore.
Great Game! Will be better once they fix more bugs and add features long overdue
"i dont like it the editor mode is broken, it doesnt save my creations and i want my money back"
full of glitches but good game
"While i do love this game, it is not without issues.  The primary issue is the multiplayer. I greatly anticipated playing classic AOE 2 with modern netcode, but apparently that was not to be. If Skybox fix the multiplayer issues I would happily reccomend this to anybody that would listen."
Great game still that just allows to play the classic on your 1080 monitor. Still a hall of famer.
"♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline attempt, too much wololololo, too hd. will never be as good as the first. got my copy in a box of cerial when i was a kid (yeah wtf kellogs but cheers)  2/10 get some breakfast and the first one."
Fun game if you exclude the CONSTANT CRASHING AFTER EACH GAME.
Bugfest -.- Maps are so buggy that I would almost call this game unfinished. Barely playable.
Not worth games a bit outdated only poor folks like me play when they got a laptop and bored
do not get this game if you want to play it with someone on your friendlist you can only play the world once. if you load in again thr host will hve all his stuff the other player will need to start again
full of glitches but good game
"i dont like it the editor mode is broken, it doesnt save my creations and i want my money back"

Great Game! Will be better once they fix more bugs and add features long overdue

I loved this game. When I was 12. Now I am not 12. Worst game ever. Ddos the website. Send a virus. 10/10 would play again.
"Okay Guys, here comes the review.  First of all this is a great game and I loved it as a kid.  But what the new expansions and the worst multiplayer system of all time did to that game is horrible! Its laggin like dead gorillas, its all slow and messy (remember, its supposed to by High Definition) and that is if you even get to play the game!  Its so full of bugs, races from the expansions cannot even be played in free play, the whole game changes languages like its google translator and all in all I can not at all gve a good review to this game.   It was once great but all Companies wanting to gain tons of money out of it sucked the soul out of this game and made it a broken, poor monstrosity of what it was once: A great and fun game.  Purchase it for one million dollars and get nothing but free bugs and lag. Dont buy it. Not even in the sale."
"Play the old, non-Steam version.  This version has really shoddy support and runs WORSE than the older version despite having no graphical improvements.  Its multiplayer is laggy, problematic, and bug-ridden. It's single player is laggy (yes, single player for a game that looks like it was released in 1999 is laggy on modern systems). The devs have abandoned this game (no updates for 10 months and counting now).  Buy the old version or use your old CDs. Download UserPatch and get all the features that come in this version. And then go to Voobly to play online with much less lag and even much better mod compatibility if that's your thing."
"Fun funfunfun game. Played over 200 hours on old PC version. HD makes graphics much better, villagers are less lame about movement, etc. Can't reccommend enough!!!!!! Good SP and MP."

"20 for the playable Original ... fine. BUt the add-ons and the new AI are just CRAP. Obviously the new 'developers', and I use the term loosely are incompetent boobs at best. 25 dollars for a new campaign when they clearly cant balance a *#$&amp;#*@ checkbook!  The AI is more stupid than its ever been. Check out the AI attacking with 50 priests! What genius idiot thought this was game was balanced who knows. But we know one thing...  BUYER BEWARE!!! THIS CRAP ISNT THE ENSEMBLE STUDIOS GAME that we loved from so long ago. NOPE!  And dont even get me started on the multiplayer hangs. It ran better on DIALUP!! "
It is really frustrating when you send you AI ally resources to buold an army... and he will just build more building(5 markets 6town centrums etc....)
"UI Scaling makes this game unplayable, and there is currently no way to fix it. Given that team is working on 4.8 beta, I can tell this problem is never going to be fixed, and i know i'm not the only one to have this problem. Would not recommend, I am returning this game. "
"Personally, I just didn't enjoy the game. As a veteran of other strategy games, especially Civilization and Total War, I just couldn't get use to the real time everything. I see how it can be a fun game though. 4/10"
"I love this game, but I'm afraid I need to downvote it because the achievements are just plain out of this world ridiculously impossible."

"Steam updated killed my unsaved game! Very cool, thanks..."
"Retro vs being rubbish is a fine line.... this game leans towards more being rubbish than retro. Not sure where the HD eliment comes into it, so just seems like a waste of money to me."
Actually kind of looks uglier at points. Gates are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless.
10/10 but not worth 16 quid! Wait for the sale :p
"This is nostalgia bait. The game is not HD at all. It is ugly, slow, and terrible. Stay away."
as of right now i can not recommend this game. for soem reason it doesnt show my food resources
Bought it for LAN...

"The original game is good but the HD version is terrible. Always crashes and lags, I'm not recommending this to anyone until they fix all the connectivity and FPS problems."
is very lag on multiplayer give my moneys back grrr
doesn't work anymore on windows 10 ????
you should be able to sell this game it sucks i rather play like pokemon this ♥♥♥♥ sucks
"Unplayable on anything above 1080p. I tried on a QHD and a QHD+ display. While the menu, cut scenes and loading screens are all scaled up, ingame it's not, so all the interface elements are tiny, text is hard to read and often even cut off. Sometimes the text gets even smaller and changes the font. I've never seen such a bad HD remake."
"This is a total scam. Claims to be HD, but it looks like crap! I want my money back!"
"Ruined my childhood.  The game is the same. In HD. Except you're no longer as excited as you used to be, and have probably gained more intelligence to make it less stimulating.  3/10  Unless you liked the original and are sure of it. Then by all means."
"Just bought AoE2 DLC and the game no longer launches. Hey, Valve, GO F*** YOURSELF!"
most boring game 1999-2k16
"no 4k support,,, can't see ♥♥♥♥"
Errrr...Wololo? *triestobefunny*
"Don't buy this if you have the original. Original does not have horrid frames, villigers and armies freezing up, and multiplayer always a second behind. Somehow devs can't fix a game that has been perfect for years. Might have to do with them abandoning the game to move on with more money grabs. The last update was in december."
"I downloaded this game as I remember it fondly from my teenage years. I played for an hour and it suddenly stopped working. I mean, I doesn't open anymore. It says 'ready to play', but it does not run. $20 dollars wasted."
I payed and downloaded the game but it doesnt work !!!! Its a waste of money and i am very dissapointed
I love AOE but this download is unplayable it lags way too much and I know its not my computer and I'm guessing I will not receive a refund either.
"I had this years ago and wanted to walk down memory lane I guess. Totally not worth $20.   I cannot recommend because there are better, more up-to-date options for this money."
All-time best RTS. No contest.   The Steam version needs a little bit of hacking to be playable online.
"Ultimate ♥♥♥♥ of the original. Don't waste your money. Everything sucks. Lower fps than the original, pathfinding is molested and the only reason anyone would get this, onlineplay, is buggy and laggy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ them."
  I can not open my game for some reason.
"Just play Stronghold Crusaders, this is just overrated casualised experience of it.  "
Its good if your gay

Probably the best game... ever
Wololo
Not enough graphics
It's ok but absolutely nowhere near as good as I remember. AOE 3 is better tbqh
Still the best!
Great Joy!
A classic must-have and a blast from the past for those of us weened on old school RTS games. My only critique- I don't really notice the 'new graphics' beyond support for HD resolutions.
"The graphic is horrendous, already uninstalled after 3 mins into the game."
Netcode is so bad I would never recommend buying this at full price.
"Single player, stuck on 'waiting for other players' Sucjk"
"bad servers, unplayable multiplayer"
"Villager(s) kills a bear with no bother (bear has 25hp), need like over 5 villagers to kill a wild boar (75hp). Also bear kills any villager with one hit, except a Magyar. 10/10 would play again !"
It's Age of Empires 2... nothing else really needs to be said.
r q left-click r q left-click h a a a a 'tssss hooo' 'tssss hooo' right-click 'gathewer'
game feels very dated. the 'improvements' to the AI are questionable in my opinion. seems like they do is make your opponents work faster than you possibly can. graphics are better but only get if you played it when it originally came out.
"1/5 Facelift, not much more."
"Why is it called HD? There is no option to increase the resolution past SD! Complete con, do not buy!"
"single player, got into a match against AI. one more than fifty units were on screen the lag was horrendous. From what I've read there hasnt been an update for months."
Laggy &amp; choppy ever since. Complete waste of money.

"Well, I just installed it and I can fully re-map all the controls (unlike the Garbage coding of Metal Gear Solid 5 [which discriminates against left-handed players])... and the game runs great (Jan 2016) straight out of the box (Windows 8.1 on Haswell i7 GTX780 PC).  Starting the tutorial has the Scottish Celts fighting back against the English opressors.  Its an older re-vamped game, but ... at least I can play (unlike MSG5 which has pre-1995 coding for controls)   AoE 2 HD.... Whats not to like.  And no GFWL.  Thumbs-up to learn one of the reputed greats."
boo cant log onto play
"Very bad game tbh, big lag all the times when play multiplayer. You can play around it during the start of the game, but when you progress into building an army and fighting the other players the lag becomes unbearable. Not fps lag, but a delay of hundreds of ms.  Dont buy this game if you're after the multiplayer aspect."
"The game's UI is not 4k compatible. I cannot read the texts, menus, or anything really. I loved this game growing up, but I cannot play the game now. Even if I scale the screen resolution back, the UI is illegible."
Laggy &amp; choppy ever since. Complete waste of money.
"Im not sure wheres the HD part in this game , AOE 2 is one of the best classic strategy game no questions about that But it seems like its a trend that they're releaseing old games sticking near their titles ''HD'' woooo........such a scam.   if you're about to buy this game just for the sake of it , nostalgia and fun as it was , then buy it my rate is 10/10  but if you're hopeing for some ''HD' stuff , i don't want to disappoint you , its the same as you played it before no changes.  my rate is 1/10 for the product not the game , i dont recommend you buying it at all."

"Goldbergstein wants his shekels.  Pros +It's age of empires 2, possibly the best RTS ever made +Rerelease invigorated online community  Cons -It's literally just age of empires 2, straight outta 1999, with a few resolution issues fixed for a whopping $20. -Performance is impressively poor. -Modern RTS's a la Starcraft 2 are in another universe as far as unit handling and pathing is concerned.  Goldbergstein should probably put in at least some effort if he wants your shekels. This is a low quality rerelease of a phenomenal game."
Crash of Empires. Not worth the 20 bucks and certainly not worth losing my sanity over.
"Terrible online, the game has lag of it's own. Rip off, ♥♥♥♥ the beast that brought this to steam. The original is so much better."
"Pros: its the age of empires we loved  Cons: it is devoloped by one of the worst team of developers, i mean, they really focus on launching new DLCs after new DLC to milk the cow, but in the process they screw the game. Right now it is not playable in multiplayer anymore, they ♥♥♥♥ed it up so bad in just 2-3 weeks. Not even amateurs behave i like, i used to work in a pretty amateur software company and they were 100 time more pros than the developers of this game.   Rule #1: dont launch a new feature if it introduces 100 bugs. This is common sense but not for these fellas. Game was fine in version 4.7 but they needed to launch a new DLC and they ♥♥♥♥ed it.  Wuldnt recommend this to a hardcofd aoe player, but Vobly is not an option either nowadays. Sad choice for us :("
"I'm still playing the old disc, thank you very much.  Come on, it should not take 7 seconds for a unit to realize he got an order. I right click a tree for the villager. 7 WHOLE SECONDS LATER (I counted) he responds. The network lag in this game is so awful it makes it borderline unplayable in multiplayer, which was the sole reason I got this game.  I've looked into this; it's not my computer, despite what everyone tells me. The netcode is a s**tstorm. This game, in so many ways, is a complete waste of money. If you really want this game, go buy it off Amazon for $10 on disc (if you don't have a disc drive, buy a USB disc drive for like $5), download the compatibility fix program from AoK Heaven (google the website), and be done with it. You get the exact same game, considering this game isn't even slightly changed minus the fact that your rocks look like piles of crap in this one.  So, in other words: 1) Buy the REAL GAME, and not this crap. Find the disc on Amazon for half the price of this. 2) Run the installer on the disc, and it'll set up on your computer. You can put in the disc to play whenever you want. 3) Download the 'Forgotten Empires' mod for this game, the mod that fixed issues with the real game such as the lack of widescreen. In fact, this mod was later copied and pasted into an 'Add-on' for this crap. 4) If you have purple water and red grass when you play, download the 'Compatibility Fix' program from AoK Heaven, a devoted fan site for the real game. 5) Play your game, and look at just how much better it is than the ugly little s**tstorm that I wasted $20 on.  If you want to play with friends, just use Hamachi, GameRanger, or whatever networking program you like.  By the way, the 'New AI' is a lie. The AI was much better in the real game. Microsoft made another sharp money grab, and I completely fell for it."
"Wauw, since the new update this game is broken.... Fix this mess.....:S"
"You cannot change the game resolation , or adjust the screen size , I would say off hand that this game was made for Ipod's or cell phones and someone got the bright idea of putting in a built in emulator and tried to call it a computer game , it doesn't play well on highend video cards , seems that 480p is about it and fps are very poor. No I would not recommend buying this game, the old Empire games were far better."
My friends never wait for me to get home from work. My whole day revolvs around that one game I get before going to bed after work. RiP ♥♥♥♥ of garbage || shitDefinition.
There was to much hd's
"Boring Boring Boring Boring Boring Boring Boring Boring.... You just sit and wait for food, wood, stone, gold...  I don't know what did i expected. :/"
"Don't buy it, if you plan to play multiplayer. It's 2015 and they are not able or willing to provide a decent online experience. "
"Very very bad compatibility for win10 user and perhaps also the latest GPU drivers. The game stops working every time even when I tried using intergrated GPU, and all the solution I can find on the internnet. Have to say, as a remastered version, it fails to match the commonly used PCs nowadays.  (My configuration: i7 4790k, gtx 980ti, msi z97, 16g ram.)"
"Performance is very poor, unacceptable on a computer this age! I don't recommend it!"

"The resolution is appalling, no options to change it within the game, editing the resolution script doesn't fix it, changing the desktop res doesn't either. How can a 10+ year old game cost $20+ when you don't even have the original settings options the game came with? Refunding."

"Not worth the purchase due to extremely bad performance (known issue, game engine / graphics grind to a stop). Additionally, the graphics are not HD. Shame."
"I bought a '4-pack' so I could play with my family, but when I try to download on another computer it says it will log the other player off if I run it. It's crap. Then I get to a window that says I can onlye 'trade' after 30 days. So it's a waste of money buying a '4 pack'. And of course there's no way listed to contact somebody for clarification at 'Steam'."

Awful AI. A disappointing HD remake.

"I can't launch my game after the update (since 12/21), and no ,i didn't buy the latest DLC. Does anyone know how to fix it?"
Horrible online performance for such an old game. Constant lag and glitches. Had to abandon a game because the options screen was stuck. They are focused more on making DLC than actually fixing their product.
"!! AVOID !!  They ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ the game, and the buyer, oh my goodness !! Where the heel is direct play, tweet.tv, screw you, fock that ♥♥♥♥. And now they are integrating a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on those bloated DLC's which break totally the original concepts and breaks the era by paradoxal historical anachronism.  This port sucks, devs should ashame on them by doing such ♥♥♥♥ work on such good game, second best RTS of history, and now that bloated, laggy, unstable, DRM version, and I must say again, where the hell is direct play, in their arses probably.  In plain 2017, and no port for Operational Systems (GNU/Linux)!?  Stick with the greater smoother solid stable masterpiece original copy"
"  I got bored after a few hours of playing, but my brother forces me to play it"
"this game is laggy as hell, even though i have 16gb in ram, 3gb in video memory and 4 cores, i want a refound, this game is crap."
"the mods aren't free boys, don't support those greedy horses"
this game wont let me play
Yeah well yeah nah oi yea nah I don't really like RTS games but this sure kicks the stick get this one good medieval game I say 6/10.
"I love this game, its fun. But, when I started up AOE nothing worked, the textures are broken, all I see are blocks.  Can anyone help me?"
"I absolutely adore this game, but when my laptop was 'upgraded' to Windows 10 I lost my ability to play AoE. I'm really, really angry about that. I have looked all over for a solution online and haven't found jack. Until this blemish is fixed, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone purchase the game."
As nostalgic as this was - there are many advances that modern games have made which highlight AoE2's shortcomings. This just isnt fun anymore. Main gripe is pace and the atrocious unit pathing. Wolololo :(
This review has stopped working due to random game crashes.
Really bad game. Buy this only if you like cheesy arcade RTS's that involve unrealistic gamey cheese tactics. Buy Rise of Nations for a deeper base building RTS with more complexity and less cheeseiness.
The main tactic of this game is make a ♥♥♥♥ton of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ troops to blitz. Worst game ever made.
"I have a 4K monitor and cannot change the in game resolution to a lower setting. Everything is so very tiny and it is not playable.   Sometimes a resolution setting is too much to ask, huh? It's 2016 jeesh"
"It NEEDS the zoom options from the original, I can't play the game when i can only see about 4 building on my screen. Whereas in the original, I could see almost EVERYTHING in my towns. I really want to play the game, but can't without zoom."
"Now every one should be familiar with Age of Empires II, a game from the ancients. Back then we got the game, and it was in traditional Chinese. This HD version does not have this language script, but INSTEAD THEY RUB BLOODY SIMPLIFIED CHINESE IN YOUR FACE! I mean why this game, perfectly functioning, is giving me this load of crap? Playing it in Chinese was part of my youth memories. Seeing it not being available in this version is already disappointing, but they throw this knock-off script into the game? Hell no! There is however in Steam Workshop which adds Traditional Chinese into the game, which is more than great, but the devs don't even bother adding it into the game officially! As for now I'll keep playing it in English... (bloody China market)  My verdict: 10/10 for bringing back a classic game -10 for having Simplified Chinese but not Traditional Overall 0/10 - NOT RECOMMENDING TO TRADITIONAL CHINESE PLAYERS UNTIL THEY ADD OFFICIAL TRADITIONAL CHINESE SCRIPT INTO THE GAME"
"This is great, and the HD edition is even greater!"
"Even worse than the previous old version. I just don't understand why there are so many BUGs in this game. If you click and command an army to move somewhere, they often stuck somewhere and just don't move. I remember that in the old AOE2, soldiers at least know how to avoid take a detour if necessary. When you are fighting with someone else, this problem become extraordinarily annoying since soldiers would take a weird route to attack and even you order them one by one, they would not take a straight route. Why would a remastered version be even worse and more stupid than the old one???"
"I asked my money back, its a disgrace they ask 20 eur for such an old game with has been made so poorly from the beginning. My main expectation was that I could play the multiplayer lag free but even that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥, one person lag the whole game lags, you goy an army of 180+ the game lags as hell. As long as they dont fix this I wouldnt want to buy this game again or unless its below 10 bucks..."
"Still wondering what exactly is HD about this game... Music is horrible, graphics are terrible, gameplay sucks. If those things are fine with you, then buy it. I enjoy RTS games. I really enjoyed AOE online before they canned it. This just isnt my kind of RTS, It's very basic. Almost cookie cutter. Although, It IS a RTS, I'm not saying the game isnt worth buying, just catch it on a sale if you buy it.   5/10"
5 out of 5 stars because everybody loves comebacks and nostalgia.
"crappy game, don't waste your money"

"&gt;convert catapult to christianity &gt;extremely fat king runs faster than cavalry &gt;10 elephants fit on a boat but not 11 archers &gt;population limit reached, delete villagers &gt;hit farm with sword, farm catches on fire &gt;one enemy villager escapes, rebuilds society   10/10  Would still play this game again.

Terrible multplayer :(
"Since years I use Linux and my days are filled with happy computing. Only seldom memories of the dark days haunt my mind, when Windows was the main operating system on my machine. In the last years even gaming became not only a choice, but a pure joy on Linux. Anyway, in a recent rush of grace I decided to commemorate one of the few positive aspects of these rough Windows-days and bought the HD remake of Age of Empires II. This game was always fun and (according to my believes) is the sole reason why Microsoft is not on the list of designated terrorist groups. As long as the HD remake is somehow close to the original it cannot really disappoint. That were my thoughts. Autumn-sales, even cheaper, what could possibly go wrong? A no-brainer! So its time to start up the good old VirtualBox running XP, which allowed me to play similar Windows-only games: Desperados, Diablo2+3, and even AoE3. The installation via Steam is as easy as expected. Right-click, Launch AoE II: HD. My mind was already playing the awesome menu tune tadaaaaa tadadadaaaa.. But instead an error message shows up: 'ERROR: The application is not a valid Win32 application'. Immediately all my joy was gone and I am in the middle of this sober and dry Windows-world, where the user is confronted with cryptic error messages, left alone in a complete mess of unresolved responsibilities. Reluctantly I start the tedious search for hints, what might be wrong and whose fault it is. And soon it becomes clear: This game requires Windows 7 upwards. I can't believe it. Windows 7. It was my fault, as I did not read the system requirements. Shame on me, ok. But after playing AoE3 and Diablo3 on that exact same machine, it was out of question for me that AoE2 might not run. And even if it is the HD remake, I simply did not expect this issue. As I categorically refuse to spend any more money on that pile of bananas which Microsoft sells as operating system, I am stuck with a game I cannot play and some memories of good old times. Probably not that bad at all, except the disappointment which stays.  (In the end I had to get the win10 iso to install the game and get 5 minutes playtime to be able to write this review. I start to question life itself)"
"Dont get me wrong the game is the best RTS of all time, but the actual owners do not deserve the money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Its an absolute abuse, abandonware sold as a 2016. The connection is extremely poorly everymatch (no match below 350 ms) since it has a 1994 programmation for it and NO dedicated servers, no exception for this. Seriously, play on voolby if you like it - but remember: boicot this game, DO NOT BUY IT!!! The greedy creator dont care about the users, i really regret my buy since i play it in Voolby or gameranger."
"I have never been more frustrated with a game than ths one. Crashes and freezes up all the time, menus pop up and freeze all the time. Download this one, u wont be so dissapointed."
Nostalgia made it seem like i had more fun with this game.
appaling waste of money even if it was free it would be still appaling
No matter what Kingdom/Nation/Faction you choose ...   You will never under stand what they are saying when you give them orders.   11/10 its ok
give me option to change resolution maybe ??
"STAY AWAY TOXIC!  Spending $20,00 on this piece of crap is an egregious waste of money. You'd be better off just going into walmart and buying an original copy for about $5.00."
"These Idiots announce the update for 'rise of the rajas' for the 19th of Dec but right now its 20:00 and still nothing happened. WHY ARE YOU WAITING !? BTW Nobody neeeds new Civs. Change something about the engine, add more efffects and redesign each Civ instead.  I suggest everyone to buy the classic CD and not this HD-Version because they are ♥♥♥♥ing the Game instead of improving.  The only positve aspect is the MP Here but if you look closer, it doesnt work at all since the last Update.  Be aware of what you are supporting guys, Don't spend ever 20$ for a 20 years old game. But a great 20 Years old game!!  Cheers ♥♥♥♥ERS"
Twoud be nice if I won and they lost. Period.
"Better offerings now exist. While the game may've been revisted, it was for a quick buck and they didn't even bother to do up the interface to modern standards - it's a chore to deal with as a result. This is a game for those only after a hit of nostalgia."
Age of We Wuz KANGZ Edition
"your site sucks, microsoft sucks and you are a bunch of money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥s."
"I cannot see anything in this game and you cannot change screen resolution. Menues, people, options and words are all far to small to read without putting your face against the screen. Not fun to play"
Failed to initialize draw system  :main.cpp(312)  wtf is this
im in love with this classic
so i own this game on steam and it will not start up for me it flashes the 'preparing to start up' screen and then nothing happens. i have tried to uninstall and reinstall the game and nothing seems to work. very dissapointing.
"I paid 13€ for this and I can't play it, it lags like hell... unplayable game, tried to change compatibility and everything else, but the game didn't work... I throwed out 13€ for this game + expansions... DON'T BUY THIS GAME!"
"i5 4570 + 20GB + GTX660 OC Lags, clicking on map just freezes for a few seconds, does nothing and is always repeatable. Playing with the few settings there's no difference at all to the POOR performance.  Original (non HD) one is quite enjoyable. This one at the moment is *."
No option to set the resolution makes this game almost unplayable when streaming to a lower resolution device.
Age of Empires two?   More like   Аss of Empires poo.
"It's very old, and I don't really think I would enjoy it much after playing it one time. I don't know how the 3rd game is, but I'm not buying it.  I have refunded this game."
"Well this game is ruled by people that are more dictators then workers of MS, they made a classic good game into piece of crap. Those dictatores rule a support forum that you get fast banned if you get opinions ( educated) that are contrary that what they think. Even people from inside is got ridded of the game because they question the leadership. Thats unacceptable behaviour for a company named Microsoft."
this website is a rip off if i pay for something i should be able to play it whenever i want i will never buy another game from here and if my game dont start working i am going to do whatever i need to do to get my money back
"this game is really old. not worth for playing in the present, forget nostalgia, we're in 2015 almost !"
"Not working, It says running and then it doesnt open."
"So many expansion,community has been split. Finding opponents for matches was already hard and they divided community with dumbass expansion so you can't find someone at all.  Seriously,wtf is african kingdoms anyway?? Why you add some random african clan to fight against some real kingdoms like spain or ottoman etc. what were you having in your mind developers?"
"Broken. Cannot change the resolution to a normal size.  Avoid at all cost, unless you want to use a magnifier to play the game."
so antiquated at this point it's more of a game you'd play on a cell phone. the 'hd' version did nothing of note for the game....
i keep loosing vs ez ai the ♥♥♥ this game is bad niec grphic ♥♥♥
bad game doesnt run on win 10 waste of money
"Horrible. As time went by, this game did not age well. Bad genes."
"I never play this, why? The UI is useless in modern monitors, no scaling at all, at 4K all you can see is buildings mostly, units are so small you can get them out of view behind the cursor."
this game has stolen age of mythology play style and change it
♥♥♥♥♥iest thing I've played in my life. I'd rather die. Please give me back my money
uhmm its not hd. 600 x 800 tops.
i cant know when to go to the next age age of mythologyis better 
Does not launch. Waste of time and money
can i play on mac?  
"I am frustrated. This game is not an economic strategy anymore. This is just a deathmatch. What was good in the old good Age of Empires II is growth. A map started with only one man on it. He had to build the city center and find food to be able to produce one more citizen. And it was hard. Generating 50pts of meat needed to produce a citizen could take alot of efforts even if you had 5 people making food it took them at least 2-3 minutes to gain the desired 50pts of meat. Now it happens in seconds by 1-2 foragers. Same with wood, stone, gold. In the original AOE you had to think what to collect first and what to build first and what technologies discover first. You had to think hard because he resources where precious. No thinking anymore. Resources are cheap, buildings are cheap, most of technologies are discovered in the very beginning. Boring. Steam. Could you please get the original AOEII to your store. It was MUCH better. I would definitely buy it."
"HD remaster is good, but aoe2 is a bad game, it always was. All those thousands of hours i played on release — it was just as bad, i just didn't know any better, despite having played c&amp;c, dune 2\2000 and cossacks. Formations ruined combat from aoe 1, which was never any smart to begin with, unit ai is insufferable and uncontrollable, your units do whatever they want, while enemy ai manually controlling each and every unit faster than you ever will.  Writing is garbage and campaigns are cringy. All units and buildings just copypasted across all nations, even visually they rarely differ.  Cossacks which was released 1 year later did everything better, especially combat (but campaigns are even worse), age of mythology has drastically different factions and good campaigns, aoe3 has much better combat and great campaigns.  No, i don't care for multiplayer, i played some in 2000s and it's not 2000s now."
age of mythology clone.
"Started a single player game, says 'waiting for other players' - Uninstall works great!"
Too old school for me to get interested in.
the game is awful
What a horrible tsai yi style game
"3/10, lost to unexperienced player because of skype window covering the wonder timer. I will never play again."
"First of all i have to say i didnt give the game an actual chance regarding gameplay. Which seemed similar to empire earth and aoe1 which i love. However! The game was so inacurate and seemed so loveless to me that i couldnt enjoy it. I started playing as Byzantines and realized quickly that the buildings seemed pretty arabic. After i builded an 'monastery' which looked like an mosque to me i checked some eastern countries like turkey and saw the buildings had been 100% copy pasted. Its pretty sad a faction gets left behind, and just showed to me how little work went into this game. And for some reason anoyed me more than it should."

"Just installed Age of Empires II HD on my Surface Pro 3. What is this, a game for ants? I can't see anything and there's no resolution options. Unless someone can convince me otherwise I'm going to request a refund. Seriously WTF is this ♥♥♥♥, No wonder Germany lost World War II."

This game sucks cos the graphics suck and it looks out dated. Why would the developers make a bad looking with bad mechanics game maybe they need a wake up call so they can make cool modern games like overwatch.
I really do not understand this game. Why is it so popular. Its graphics look like they are from the early 2000's. Starcraft 2 came out years ago and still looks better than this game. I mean c'mon. You also can't get to the modern age which is dumb because bows and arrows are not as good as guns imo.
"huge ripoff of clash of clans, how can you even call this hd when 4k doesnt exist yet? haha XD XDDDD 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
"It's age of empires 2, what more do I need to say? :D"
One time while playing against the AI I caught the AI cheating. We were playing a gold rush map with the map being relvealed so I saw what was going down. This A-hole keep sending me 'gold required only' siege weapons that were doing damage. So I devised a strategy to create a FOB around the only gold left in the map (the middle). After brutal fighting I was able to wall off the gold and start starving the AI out. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ STILL managed to create the gold only siege weapons hours after of having NO GOLD.   Fantastic game that has aged perfectly.
goes on sale 10 hours after i buy it......good game tho  
"If you have a few hours to kill, then id recommend this game to anyone. its fun quick to pick up the controls you can play single player, or invite your friends and team up against AI or each other great fun can lose half a day playing this easily. Thanks for reading."
"They managed to ruin one of my favourite games, LAN has been removed, the resolution is simply too high, it ruins performance and makes the game ugly. Uninstalled after much disappointment."
one of my all time faverate game should really get if you like any stratagey game however its a bit pricey.
"I miss enjoying playing this game when I first started playing pc games and it was one of my favorite game to play with my family and friends. when i saw this steam, first it was kinda unstable, but after getting use to it and checking out the new civilizations in the dlc, it still bring back memories of my childhood so 8/10 if the game wasn't glitch out when i attack with large number of armies"
"Forge your empire and destroy all the enemy buildings and kill all of they villagers and units... Or you can die trying. You start with a town building, five villagers and a horse unit... Good luck!"
The best game PERIOD!!!!
the same fun as years ago
The AI is awful. Even on the hardest setting it just gave up! stopped making units &amp; villages even though it definelty had the resources to do so. Multiplayer against other players is good though.
"Nice update of an old classic! I already owned about 5 hard copies of this game, but TCP/IP multiplayer is kinda hard to deal with nowadays. When the Steam version came along, I leapt at the chance for easy multiplayer! I've since persuaded 8 or 10 of my friends to buy copies themselves, along with The Forgotten DLC."
This game is cash.
They've basically got it right.
"i don't give two ♥♥♥♥s what the other brothers say about this game, it's my ♥♥♥♥."
"A must buy for all who love strategy games. This one was released in the 90`s and is to this day my favorite game of all time. When in was announced that they would make a re re-release on steam with higher resolution i could not wait. Its fun, its addictive and it makes you wonder why they made Age of Empires Online..."
"Excellent game, anyone that enjoyed the original will love this. Multiplayer works great"
"Definitely a recommendation from me. I played this a lot as a kid, and I was thrilled to find it was re-released on Steam so it was an instance purchase. Great classic game with an active community, plenty of things do, with the campaign and unlimited hours of multiplayer fun.   If you've ever been interested in Age of Empires, but never played it, then AoE2 is the place to start. This version has all the extra expansion content too so that's a bonus.   Arguably the best RTS ever. Love it."
I've had a lot of fun playing this with friends. :)
Nostalgic game. Single player is fun because of historic teachings. Multiplayer is challenging and can be frusterating at times since its mostly based of off macro economy style and can be hard to learn such strategies.
"This is still a great game, even though it is 15 years old. I have experienced a little stuttering in multiplayer, but no more so than in the original version. Its great to be able to play the game on Windows 7 and not have the graphics go crazy."
Love the updated graphics. Great game. tons of nostalgia. definetly a 10 out of 10!
"Lag is the problem! The game and the Forgotten DLC are really nice idea but the multyplayer is unplayble. Units correspondent to orders with huge delay that once i lost all my villagers on a nomad map, cause they sipmpy would not respond to my commands... Not to mention that you can lose whole stacks of army formations for seconds due to Onagers abuse, becuase of the lag.   Second issues is the useless ELO system. Average elo is 1600 and if you lose a couple of games or you win a alot and get higher you are not welcomed into the 1600 club anymore - you get kicked from any room. And this is a problem, becuase many players that hit 1700-1800 literally can't find a game to play, because the majority of players is ~1600."
"A old classic game that is always fun to play. it may be old and the graphics might not look the nicest, but if you can play 3 hours straight without noticing how much time has gone by, I can sure tell you it is a good game."
The Coolest RTS in my life
Took me 11 years to kill a cheetah looking thing. I won though.  12/10
Great game!
The game is great! But nothing better than whati s in AoE 3 Buy it on sale with some friends. Don't bother otherwise
made b4 microsoft games turned into ♥♥♥♥
Great job recreating the game for multiplayer support.
"Many a night of my childhood was spent playing this game. It's just one of thoes games you either hate it or love it, and I definitely love it. It's got a great feel, can be confusing to new players though, or if you haven't played it in a while. The DLC is all good. It's generally just such a good game and you wouldn't be making a mistake by buying it."
"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice game to play, good old nostalgia for some. Strategic action on historical grounds. However, for achievement hunters this game is a nightmare.  * There are 250 achievements, and most of the achievements require a specific number of specific things, the greatest number usually being 500 or 1000. Imagine taking part in 1000 multiplayer sessions. How about single player sessions? How about suffering casualties, destroying buildings, creating buildings... How about winning one, five or fifty matches with EVERY RACE in the game?! How about.. egh, you get the image. *  What's worse, every achievement has a sh*tload of text, usually spanning across the overlay or steam's own window, occasionally and effectively rendering the achievement's actual goal unreadable. For example, read that text that's between those stars. That's Achievement Text Simulator 2015 for you :D  "
Best game from my childhood. Even though it takes up a crap load amount of time it is still very fun to play 10/10 playing it again :D
Nice game.
"The Game is great, even if I wouldnt recommend buying it if you still have the original and no problems with support or anything as I do'nt think the 'HD' upgrade is worth buying again. On the other side higher Population and Mod-Support. Worth the Game, when on Sale also the Upgrade."
Tried to explore the world with a naked runner. Got attacked in every single town for being nude. 10/10 Best dark age streaking simulator I've ever gotten.
"Replaying AOEII in glorious HD was a beautiful nostalgic journey in which I could finally overcome a game whose concept enchanted me and whose difficulty hounded me as a child. The game is still complex, the missions long and ardouous, but all of evokes a different type of strategy. These aren't 30 minute missions you can play on a lunch break, you're in for a long haul, fighting to push the English back to their own soil or conquer the world as Kublai Khan. Unlike AOE3, no unit reigns supreme; cannon are weak but can devastate large towers and walls, cavalry are ferocious and swift but can be mown down with enough arrows or a small force of pikes. Each situation requires careful planning and preparation.   If you know you have the time to enjoy it, buy the game, install some extra graphics mods through steam workshop, and settle in for about 120 hours of fun."
Esemble studios... were they at tho??????
"Its a nice remodel of the original AoE2, though it is sometimes quite long (yesterday it took me quite some hours to win a game: there are not many possibilities to win from a strong opponent as there are with Age of Mythology, so it may take a while to complete a game)."
My life is complete. Childhood restored.  1# Strat gaim
thanks to the hd particles my archers now fire 3 pixels. Thanks Ubisoft for making yet another broken game.   2.5 hour games against easy bots on a 4v4 is the time of my life though. It's my jam. 10/10
Age of Empires II will become a relic in the future.
"Still feels like the first game I fell in love with, just now it has better graphics!"
Pls make Age of Empire I! Best review would read again 10/10!
great game 
for strategic gameplay. game is good
Wolololo. 8/8 m8.  Pros: -Works beautifully on new PCs -Dat Water -Does new civs -On sale for $5 for game+ dlc wut a g8 deal
This game is very fun and I highly reccommend it to any player that loves strategy!
"Simply love this game, reminds me of the good old times. Hit house with a sword - it catches fire.  "
"Fantastic game, brings back lots of childhood memories and it still holds up today!"
Still a quality game after all these years !
"if this game was great, being on HD and the new expansion makes it PERFECT."
"I have to say. I didnt really notice the HD at first, but eventually. It was much more vibrant and had more of an aesthetic appeal. Also, a lot of glitches were patched over. It's a solid remake, 8.5/10"
honestly this game is so much fun with your friends 10/10 would buy again
This game is really addicting and by far the best AOE game in my opinion. The game is fun simply playing a match single player though it's most playable with friends.
"Brings back all these great memories of al those years back! Even if you'll play this game only for a few hours to remember the nostalgie, you should buy it!"
easily one of the best games ever it might not have the best graphics but for what it is it's amazing i love this game lol even after all these years of playing i still find it amazing lol
"Age of Empires II HD  Before i start this review, please note that i am not a native english speaker/writer so excuse my average english.    Age of Empires II HD is as the name says , a HD remake of the old game Age of Empires II.The game is a realtime strategy game, which has both a competetive and a casual scene. Given the fact that pretty mutch everybody already knows about this game, ill just tell you the differences between the old game , and this HD remake.  First : There is a DLC called the forgotten , it is fun but nobody plays it online , so you will mostly play it SP , speaking of online the game features a lobby system allowing up to 4v4, you generally will find games, and if your good enough even make it to the top.  Sorry for the short review , got no time recently.  Also check my Mass effect review(s) and my Sanctum 2 review :)"
I GOT THIS GAME AS A CHILD. ITS STILL THE SAME JUST WITH HD MLG NOSCOPING 60FPS GRAPHICS. I STILL MASTERBATE TO THIS GAME EVERYDAY . 10/10 YOU SHOULD GET THIS IF YOU LOVE AOE OR AOM.  PS MY IM ASIAN YOU CAN TRUST ME
Really good to have it remoddeled and still have the same basic structure that I used to enjoy when younger.
A classic brought back for the morden audience with HD graphics and full modding capabilities. Endless RTS fun
"The good old Age of Empires II we all grew to love, now with slightly better graphics and the ability to play against Steam friends. A must have for anyone who played this game a lot as a kid."
"One of my favorite games of all time. Well worth it, even years after my childhood."
My absolute favorite RTS I've ever played. The workshop adds a bit of refreshing content as well as the expansion pack.
Old school. One of the best!!!
the best rts ever made now look even better
"Great fun, but network code is still sloppy. Starcraft 2 is better, but if you were an Age 2 fan, you won't regret."
"I played 2 games whan I was a kid. Age of Empires and Empire Earth. EE was always my favourite but AOE a strong 2nd. What I liked about AOE is their focus on a few ages instead of hunders of years like in EE. I could play this game every day for a few hours vs bots and now I can play online with my friends&lt;3. A perfect comeback to the golden game. If you like this one I also recommend Rise of Nations, also redone in HD."
"For people with a flavour to play 2D games and strategy a clearly must-have. On the other hand, CoD-players will not be very happy to the this game.  It's individually but my score: 9,5/10"
Great Game Overall. I love that they actually released an update to the classic. The AI is actually smarter in the forgotton expansion and allows you to hone your skillls. I would highly reccomend this game.
"This game no matter 'the passing time' it still one of the best games ever, played when i was a child still excites today, still have the colllectors edition pack to prove it =)  True classic to behold."
My brother &amp; I play this game &amp; AoE3. For $3.99?! thats a steal!
"Classic game. Great remake and the workshop is a massive bonus 2. If you liked this game, you should try it in HD. 4/5"
"This game intruduced me to Strategic-games, when it first came. I still play these games to this day. Buy it while it's on sale!!!"
"One of the best RTS to come along. Ever. This game set the bar for the genre. If you dont own this game, you probably dont enjoy real time strategy."
1000 to 2000 hours played when I was younger..  This is an classic game! 
This game has not lost its appeal after 15 years
this game is amazing. that is until steam tried to 'balence the civs' but you can still use the old ai so 10/10
Age of Bugs :D
Wololo
Great game
"So many hours playing this game as a kid. I am so glad to have it back, and in 1080p NO LESS!"
"First of all Add me as a friend: Remy7_7  I think that this game has to be one of the best games in the world.  I played this game when i was a kid about 7 years old (14 years old now), this is the game that made me play many other games and the first game i played on an electronic device.  It all started when i was a kid with a very boring life, and then all of a sudden my uncle gets this game with a pc for me on christmas. I have never experienced a game better than this before. I do not like 2D games that much but this game is exceptional. After we had to move to another country, i lost my pc including the game. Throughout the years i have been searching for this game everywhere. I have finally found this game and never felt happier. I played this game about 9 hours a day (this is the first day).   It may look stupid and boring, but once you buy it and play. YOU WILL NOT STOP!!!!!  I love this game, it brings back many memories.  Games that bring back memories and are top on my list: Age of Empires, Call of Duty Black ops 2, Tomb Raider, Army of Zin.  I reccomend this game because i know that everyone would love it!!"
This game reinforces the stereotype that medieval people had a 10 minute average life expectancy.
Would give this game a 11/10 if you HAVE FRIENDS if not go home
"Excatly as I remember it, sans issues that I had when playing it on Vista on up."
really good 1v1 me my army vs urs
Great game! Started playing it whe i was 11. Now 14 Years later still exited to play it. :D
"Join a random server and hear stop touching me and people screaming yes and no! Funniest lobby I have ever been in! But seriously, this game hits the spot as a good rts game. If you get the chance I recommend buying the 4 pack because playing with friends is very enjoyable.  2015 Year of the Lights"
This is a great game for anyone who loves strategy games. I played it back when it came out and i play it now. This game defines what a true RTS should be like in my opinion.
Classic game that still holds up extremely well today. Get it if you haven't already.
This is a classic game. I have started playing this game for more than 10 years. AOE is still really attactive to me in 2015. There is no doubt that this game is wonderful. I am glad to see this game with HD quality. I am still looking forward to this game dlc.
The game is fun but it kinda lags on all PC's unlike the original. Overall not as smooth.
"awesome, favourite game of my childhood :D The beginning of RTS games :D"
"Positive recommendation!  At its core, this is still the classic Age of Empires 2 gameplay experience. I have heard that the multiplayer had some bad bugs when the game launched, but I have also heard that they have (mostly) been fixed and ironed out by this point (I generally play singleplayer anyways, so I might be biased in this regard). All of the campaigns from both the original game and the expansion set are included here. You can discover hours upon hours of historical empire-building strategy and fun!  Basically, this is a classic real-time strategy (RTS) game that has truly stood the test of time. And, it is actually very educational too - this was the game that made me fall in love with world history when I was young; it is at least partly due to the Age of Empires series that I decided to study history at university. So, if you have a young one and want him or her to learn some history while also having fun on the computer, buy Age of Empires 2!  Also, if you have the extra funds, be sure to get the brand-new 'Forgotten' DLC expansion, which adds brand-new civilizations, units, and campaigns not seen in the original game or its expansion.  All in all, this game comes highly recommended!"
"Very solid, classic game. I played this game all the time as a kid. Expctations did not disappoint. If you like RTS, You like AoE"
smashed the hours out on this when i was a kid  played it online first with a friend the other day  he trebuched his way through a forest  13/10  would rebuy any day
"I have enjoyed playing this game, and I just started! I'm recording for my channel, but I couldn't help playing off camera since there is so much to explore and learn about. I feel like I'm back in history being each character! I would highly recommend this if you like a clean, easy to play, strategic game."
"Good as it was new, still loving this game. Great to have the multiplayer working."
"The only 'Age of' anything worth buying. It's simple enough to get a hold of quickly, and the has enough content to keep you playing for hours on end. Don't forget it's also got multiplayer and steamworkshop."
Great game. Played it a lot in college and bought it here a few weeks ago and can't stop playing it now. Great stategy game that keeps you entertained.
"While the HD release doesn't add anything really to the gameplay or the look of the game for that matter, it's still a solid play if you like the original and don't have it anymore."
Just perfect! Back to the good old times fitting right in my new screen! Own online hosted games included via Steam!
I've never told my friends 'i will bring death upon your people and leave a burning trail of ash and despair' and ment it
"Well, it's been a long time since I played this game. Is it as good as I remember it? Heck no it's better then I remember it! Now with a brand spankin new community and multiplayer back up for one of the games that made my late childhood, I'd reccomend picking this bad boy up, wouldn't you~?"
"This is the old classic we all know and love. It's technically an RTS but just like Company of Heroes is nothing like Total War. The 2D Graphics are very good considering it's release in 1999 two years after it's predecessor. This game is a brillinat game and i definitely recommend picking it up. However, the 'HD' part of the tilte can definitely be disputed. Despite this you can still get some better HD textures from the Steam Workshop along with some maps and other add-ons, unless you're like me and prefer the classic textures. 8/10"
"AoE 2 has a tremendous sense of scale that other RTS games lack. City-building, the games' most fundemental and neccisary gameplay aspect, is intricate and interesting, and the combat and conquest (should you so choose) aspects of gameplay are well balanced and deeply tactical. Unit AI are smart, quickly organising themselves into formations of your choice (also very easy to pick up), making managing large numbers of men and machinery a simple task, which is just as well. There are many, MANY other things that need your attention. Age of Empires 2 is the Ultimate Example of 'Easy to learn, Tricky to master', and probably one of the best the genre has to offer, even years after its release."
This game is amazing 
Pros Nostalgia Lotsa Mods Great Community Smarter AI Forgotten Campaigns More Civilizations Better Multiplayer Experience  Cons Graphics Same sound effects No voice narration for Forgotten Campaigns 
A classic!
Great game! Love that you can play it with other people online!
"This game is super fun to play, whether you are looking for a strategic challenge, or you are looking to control hundreds of villagers for a few hours. The feature of this game that I enjoy the most is the ability to build up the in-game economy."
"A true classic, works just like the original but with carefully updated graphics. Love it!"
"Classic real-time strategy at its best. 'Age of Empires II' is from a simpler age of RTS games with less resources to manage, more basic animations and a more basic set of rules. However, this means it's not bogged down in complicated concepts or overextensive resource managment.  With a wide range of cultures to play as and maps to play on, there's plenty of fun to be had on the custom game modes whilst the campaign(s), like in most RTS games, feels a little limp. Online gameplay is largely stable and it is often not too difficult to find an opponent of your own level, though personally I'd always recommend playing with friends.  The £15 price-tag is reasonable if you're an RTS fan wanting a nostalgia hit. General RTS fans may want to wait for a slightly lower price."
"very good recreation, exactly like the original"
"still just as good as i remember, everybody should own this masterpiece of a game"
Still one of the best RTS's out there   Online is working again thanks to steam.  
This game taught me more about history than any class ever did. Hours of gameplay planning the complete anihilation of your enemies while trying to keep alliances makes for endless fun for any RTS fan.
"7.9/10  Hot key commands that the PC version had from a decade ago are not apart of the game (though figure easy enough to put in, too lazy to look), besides that just like the original plus you have workshop additions (never tried those). If you liked the original back in the day then it won't disappoint"
Good for wasting time as multiplayer..
No aussie servers T_T  1 second delay if your not playing lan
"This game is okay, but here's the thing, i never bought this game :P, a IRL friend wanted this game so bad, so he purchased on MY steam account and now i'm stuck with it. However this game is still fun, i like how they added a shelby cobra cheat code for this game while ages of empires III had a funnier cheat code which i won't tell you because you think i'm crazy. Anyway, you should get it if you like strategy games."
+1
"AoE II is an amazing strategy which has aged gracefully over the years. Even though it may be dated, this game still can steal hours away, why, because it is simple and fun. This game has all you could want and anyone from a seasoned vet who wants to build an empire all the way to a 4th grader just learning the ropes, there is no base skill or RTS knowlege required to jump in and have loads of fun."
Classic game! The hd edition is an excellent addition to the game and the forgotten dlc adds tonnes of content. 9/10!
I've been playing this game since it was new and it has yet to get old. It is still my favorite game in one of my favorite genres: RTS. Cannot recommend it enough!
"Amazingly addictive! I recommend this gane, brings back memories, it may look weird but don't judge a book by its cover!"
"A few graphics elements are updated, like water and uh... hmm.  Oh it has working multiplayer now! But it stutters pretty badly sometimes.  Uhhh.... hmmm..... nope, nothing else is new, its just plain old AoE2. But you know, it's AoE2 so its p much 10/10 would play again"
An well designed and built game. The major limitation with the old edition was that the maximum population was 200 it has been expanded to 500 for this edition which significantly improves the game. Better control of formations would be the only improvement I can think of for this game.
After about 45 hours this game becomes 100% ♥♥♥♥...
Childhood game remastered and still just as awesome as it was back in the end 1999. Now I can play this on my Alienware over every new AAA game with all thier fancy graphics and minimal gameplay! Just get this game!
Exactly like the old times!!! Fun fun fun!
"just as good as i remembered, only better (ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง  also... its in HD つ ◔_◔つ"
A very well done upgrade to the game. I would recommend anyone to take the opportunity
10/10. Love This game.
this could be over $20 and i would still buy it
A good old classic that's remastered. I enjoyed the new campaigns and the updated AI.
1.Build monastery 2.Build monks 3.Wololololo 4.???? 5.Profit
"Great Classic, should totally get this for the throwback value alone"
I nostalgia'd right out as soon as I started it up. A classic RTS that really hasn't seen too many come close to it.   Only problem I have with it is the sound keeps going back to 100% which rekt my ears.
"I really have to ask myself, 'Why can't they make a better RTS than AoE2?' I mean I started playing this in 1998! But they can't..."
i want 4 mac pleass
My childhood forever.
"The original classic, brought back to life!  Simply put, the game hasn't been adjusted or made 'HD' in reality - basically native widescreen support has been implemented (no need for 3rd party modded EXEs for the original AoEII!), with Steam integration &amp; match making functionality.   Simply put, the online play used to be so hit &amp; miss with players having different versions, no-CD cracks, etc - whereas now it simply just works!  Everything is as you remembered, and it's still great fun to play - especially with friends. Get ready for the 'Wololo' and 'Start the Game Already' spam in the Multi chat - this is definitely worth picking up, especially for £2.99 *(Xmas Sale is on as of the time I'm writing this).  Rogan? :)"
"You can't go wrong with AoE. The 2nd game I've ever played on the computer, the oldest, yet, still the best RTS game I've played to date.. I can't find anything wrong with this game! Must get if you've played AoE before!!"
Thumbs up for we want Age of Empires 1 HD remake. Also this is great classic remade with HD textures and lots of nice features including new civs and units. This and Age of Empires 1 is where my gaming started all those years ago.
"Absolutely funtastic, AOE 2 classic RTS!!! nostalgic"
Went out hunting for wolves with a whole army   11/10
a amazing part of my childhood
totally epic!
"This is a really good game. I've played the old AoEII before it was HD and it was pretty awesome then. But since they did the HD upgrade, it has totally enhanced this game for me. I used to play alone with an occasional LAN battle with a friend, but when I saw this, I was like 'wow'. I've had a lot of fun playing it online and offline, with friends and with strangers. I will say this game is very good as it teaches you to use strategy, compared to some games out there."
"As a kid I played this game with my sister and cousins, and now we all play different nations on a bigger scale. Before, there was one computer, or connecting over lan, and taking turns with the mouse, now theres the usage of hotkeys and Skype. This game is as fun as it was the day we all unboxed it, over ten years ago. Buy it."
AOE II is brilliant. This HD version comes with better resolution AND it works really well for multiplayer via Steam.   This is a winner if you like city-building/RTS games.
it's fun with friends. I play with friends. It's a lot better. It's actually pretty fun. Do it. 80% is probably the best sale for this game. Buy like the 4 pack with your friends. Totes worth it. you become top friend. control friend group. Become top kek. You are weiner of life.
"Welcome back to childhood, remastered in HD. All of those 'micromanaging' times are coming back.  For players with low-end computers, don't buy the game until you secure some kind of decent graphics card that's compatible with DirectX 9.0c otherwise you will get Subcode=3 Errors like I did. Also, the game will lag a lot even if you have some HD features on. Let the Wololo begin. "
Missing LAN play feature
I didn't mind the original graphics of AoE2 but the cleaned up look appeals to others. The compatibility with 64 bit operating systems is nice. On the original version had problems. The increased map size and population limit are excellent. My only complaint is that all the hotkeys were changed.
A fun game with or without friends!  
Literally THE BEST real time strategy game of all time. There is nothing more fun and nothing more competetive than this.
"I play this game with friends when we get together, great game and is really fun when everyone is competitive."
I played it some.
"Great to have this game back, one of the best strategy games of all time."
nostalgia all the way. played the first one more than this but this one is still pretty memorable!
"Great to play with a few of your friends. Although, don't include too many unit slots if you decide to play against the computer."
Most awesome choice to improve and bring AOE2 back!! Def love the Workshop integration :D
Awesome game still love it to this day!
"It brings back great old memories :,D"
Quite simply one of the best games I have ever played
"it's like crack, amazing!"
"Spent years playing on LAN, can't believe how seamless matchmaking is on here. Very nicely done, makes for an excellent &amp; addictive online game"
"This is probally one of the best rts games i've I had the pleasure of playing. This game was shown to me when I was just in middle school, and I still play this game all of the time. Well worth the money and the replayability is amazing. However it may take awhile to play just one game cause the gameplay is that inmersive. Also you will probally learn something in the campaign, after all it is the Age of Empires."
"Same as the original but can be run at 1920 x 1080, they've also added steam achievements but the most useful part is being able to invite and join games using steam."
"Amazing, just like the old days of playing this as a child!"
"A very great classic. Easy to pick up and play by yourself, with friends, or with anyone else on the world really! I highly recommend this for anyone who loves a good old RTS."
I thought this would bring back memories from when I was younger and it certainly did! By today's standards it is very dated in terms of the controls but the graphics are still brilliant for what they are.   If you have played this before and want to relive it then I would recommend this however if you have come on the RTS scene a bit more recently I would stear away from this one and get something released a bit more recently.
One of the greatest games of all time  GET IT
"Great classic game, spent many hours in the past competing online ! Great buy....."
"Fantastic game, a real blast from the past for me!!"
"Don't be scared away by the 69 review from Metacritic (most of the bad reviews are because they didn't really change much other then the graphics). This is a fantastic game, that might be a little bias since this was one of my childhood games, but it is a really good game. The campaigns are really fun and multiplayer is also fun with a bunch of friends. Can't really come up with any complaints, the AI is not stupid like every other strategy game. I haven't played it for years, but playing on normal is even a challenge. To me it has stood the test of time and you will spend hours playing this game."
Wololo
cool
"Classic Real-Time Strategy Game at its FINEST!  I would say I'm a Age of Empires II fans myself when I was 10 back then. I used to play this game with myself and what I played back then was only campaign mode (can't remember the story of the game XD). I loved it more than Starcraft and Command and Conquer.  I am very glad that this game got a HD remastered. AND AN EXPANSION after like what.... 8 years of release? IT'S AMAZING.  For people who like this series, it's a must buy. For people who likes RTS, I also recommend this game to you. (I personally think II is a better game than III). The difference between the civilizations are very nicely represented by its in-game graphics, viewtiful graphics considering it was made in 1999, and an in-depth gaming mechanics that requires tons of time trying out strategies.  It seems like the community and the publishers didn't give up this game since they are having streamings every now and then. Check them out sometimes if you can't decide, maybe the streaming will give you an answer. But for me, I highly recommend this game to you."

"If you liked playing AOE2 online like I did, you will love that you can play online again with this version!"
"Very good game, I see memories from long time ago when I played on PSX/PS2. Definately worth this price !"
"This is the first game I ever owned back in the day. Me and my friends from school days are now playing for a bit of nostalgia, and are getting more out of it now than we did then! A classis RTS, looks a bit dated, but the music still stands up. Gameplay, great. Online, great. Don't miss out on the chance to own one of the best strategy games ever made."
"Good game but multiplayer can disconnect because of an 'out of sync' error. However upon close inspection it's really quite a rare error, for me anyway.  I'm awful at the game but it is bloody brilliant."
An absolutely must play classic.
"Thanks for bringing back this classic. And with addon no less. It doesn't aged that much, drawn 2D graphic still looks good. If you somehow managed to missed it when it was in full bloom, grab it now. Don't let pixels discourage you, there is a lot of soul there, I don't play multiplayer at all, but heard it was pretty balanced. Campaigns are interesting and fun, way better than in first one. Beat them all. Mongols are by far the best. Hope the addon will live up to expectations as well."
"This is my childhood returned, buy this now...honestly, there's a thing at the top that says 'Buy' click it."
Great !!!
"Remarkable how many people still play this over a decade after release. Though there are many multiplayer-RTS games on the market, this one was one of those who set the standard. Though very basic it's good for a few hours of nostalgia, and because of the internet era the first time some of us will be able to experience the multiplayer mode."
Amazing game ! So much fun I've convinced all my close friends to get a copy. Even went out of my way and bought it for a few! They all love it as well. There are a fwe muiltiplayer issues that need to be addressed but anything that's not 4v4 runs great!
Classic!!!!!
"AOE2 has been in my top five PC games of all time forever and so I was super excited about the re-release in HD. It's still the game I knew and loved, but prettier. SO many memories came flooding back playing civilization after civilization and I was so very happy....   and then the expansion came....  The AI got ALL sorts of messed up. The one thing, IMO, that always distinguished AOE2 from other RTS games is AI pathfinding. Starcraft, Warcraft, C&amp;C, all the biggies had computer AI that knew where you were from the second the game started and therefore made a fair fight impossible. In AOE2, if you saw a scout, you knew you were gonna be attacked soon, which is the way it should be. After the expansion, hordes of troops would be inside your camp with no scouting whatsoever. Also, for lack of a better term, resource management of AI was wrecked. I played 2vs2 with my step-dad for five hours and watched wave after wave of troops die, WITH NO RESOURCES LEFT ON THE MAP. We saw AI troops walk right through walls, watched arrows decimate walls, and all tactics go right out the window. It's pretty much an exercise in frustration playing with or against AI in it's current state.  I will give it a recommendation with one stipulation...  DON'T INSTALL ANY PATCHES OR BUY THE EXPANSION"
I used nothing but horses and cars to destroy the world. 10/10
awesome really addicting but you get sick of it after 20 hours of playing
My hours can't tell how much I still appreciate this game. They can't because of my lack of time to play it. I would play 24/7 if I could. I just can't get enough.
This game is the true Original Gangster!
"The Classic, but in HD. Having logged hundreds of hours into the original, this is everything I dreamed it would be. If you loved the original, or are a fan of RTS games, you won't be disappointed. Goes on sale a lot, too."
"First game I ever played on PC, in 2004. still playing it more than a decade later. That should speak for itself."
"As much as I would love to recommend this game, I can't. Despite the nostalgia I get from playing this after being away from it for almost ten years, the lag you'll experience during multiplayer is unbearable, this even happens when you are in Friend-only matches. But i suppose I should add something positive to this review so here goes: -Great gameplay with a good amount of game modes to choose from. -The soundtrack is as good as ever.  Unless somebody finds a way to fix the lag, don't get it for the multiplayer. You're better of finding a copy of the old version and then play with your friends on that instead."
"If you aren´t the type of guy who plays strategic games, you can start with this beauty, it is easy to play and insanely adictive. Plus, you learn some history while your are playing."
This was the best Age of Empires in the series and it has never looked better than it does now.
Lots of fun everything was going great until I installed a mod and now I can not play anymore. I recommend the game but stay away from the steam workshop.
"AoE II was a great game imo  AoE II HD is pretty much the same ♥♥♥♥ but you cant play it online AoE II HD doesnt have dedicated servers online, players have to host em and cuz of that nobody plays it.  5/10 DONT BUY IT."
"So far, seems like a good HD remake of a classic, nostalgic game.  Most mechanics, units, and sounds seem to be the same for the most part. However, the increase in resolution was much needed, steam integration is a plus, and it was always a pain to try to lan the original game. There is more intelligent AI as well, if that's something you needed  The only gripe was that at the beginning of the game it's a little laggy/clunky, but it quickly smoothes out after ~15 seconds."
Best game for 15 years.
As good as the original but much easier to play online without faffing about with LAN cables!! 9/10
One of the best games I have ever played. Spent hours and hours on it when I was a kid. Still great even 20 years later.
"Great game to play with friends, and loads of fun for LAN parties."
"I enjoyed playing this game on the previous version. I think now that the game is in HD it has revived my love of the game. It is so much more fun, and with the new AI, so much more challenging. Certain aspects of the game seem to run much more smoothly than they used to, which is a good thing! Also the new multiplayer has brought the game back to life.... If you read this and fancy playing against me online, message me!!   Overall very good game! Would reccomend it to anybody who likes a good RTS!!"
"Stays true to the original, yet manages to stay fresh. We don't even need Age of Empires 4 because it won't be better than this."
"THIS IS AGE OF EMPIRES, LEGENDARY RTS OFF ALL TIME...... DON'T THINK TWICE MAN JUST BUY AND LET THE NOSTALGIA BEGIN 1000/10"
Super fun with friends!
"Loved this game when I first bought a pc, brings back good memories!"
"This game is highly addictive, easy to play, and so much fun both online and offline. highly recommened"
"While it's not an actual HD remake, (they only added 1080p support) it's still AOE 2, which is amazing and fun to play. The singleplayer works fine, but there are some lag issues with the multiplayer from time to time.  It's great fun, get it now! :)"
"Oh yes, such a classic title! But...where is the HD?  I recommend to buy it for nostalgia but wait for a disscount."
Timeless masterpiece.  HD is cool.
Everyone should own this game!
^^
"Age of Empires II is one of the best real time strategy games ever to come to PC. Many nations to choose from each with their own unique unit(s) and bonus'. Randomly generated maps, flora and fauna make each game different with a very high replay value. There are a few different game modes which can be used single and multiplayer along with a selection of various single player campaigns.  The HD edition has greatly improved graphics with a few nice features. It includes the conquerors expansion pack for free and has a new expansion named the Forgotten, bought separately. Using Steam makes it easier to create and join multiplayer games in an instant without having to use third party tools such as Game Ranger. The Steam workshop expands the games and allows people to create campaigns and mods which are very nice.  If you are a great fan of RS games, this is one of, if not, the best.  10/10"
"Good game and worth the money. I played this as a kid and was delighted to see that they had brought out a HD version, however it is not so much a HD version and more of a wide screen version but is still fun and works well on not so good computers and laptops as well as the pro computers. If you're looking to mod the game then it can be easily done through the steam workshop, but be WARNED some of the mods will effect online gameplay (which is a key aspect of this game) and may stop you playing online all together. Age of Empires is not easy to get into and may be boring for new players but if you love strategy games and are more focused on the gameplay rather than how good it looks, then this is the game for you.  Hope this helps anyone!!!"
A wonderful game that honestly still holds up today. This version fixes SO many problems that we would have at LAN parties with the original on modern hardware.
"great game, a real classic !!!"
"Age of Empires 2 HD is a remake of the original Age of Empires 2 which was popular back in the day but no longer able to run on modern machines as resolution sizes have increased and old multiplayer protocols no longer exist.  I'd recommend this for a few reasons: Nostaligia / great game, Steam Workshop / custom content, Multiplayer match-making via Steam so you can join your friends with ease."
"Hey look, Age of Empires 2 is back that can only be a good thing right? You're wrong, all of the issues that existed in the original still exist in this mega updated HD version (aka bigger screen resolution). Poor unit formations, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that double back on themselves, lag while playing with AI, lag from the scoreboard, general lag and more lag.   It's ok though because they updated the food icon to be PETA friendly. Except for on the farms and every other food resource, maybe they forgot?"
"If you've got the original Version, Skip this one. Nothing groundbreaking here, almost unnoticable visual changes. The Forgotten Expansion, adds a couple new races, but again not enough to make it worth buying. On the other hand if you've never played, it is a good game, wait for a sale though."
"One of the first games I played over 10 years ago, and still playing it. one of the best strats and base building games ever!"
"You dropped $20 on an HD update when you could've just installed a non-drm copy of AOE2 and used an HD mod.  its a fun game, I LOVE GOLD, build castles near your enemy bases, WOLOLO, SHHH-HOH!"
brillliant game 100% buy it no real problems
THIS IS AWESOME
"Age of Empires II is certainly one of the best real-time strategy games of all time. While the launch of this game (almost two years ago already) was a little spotty, the developers have continued to improve things and released several patches since then.   The community is also very strong and I usually have no problem finding multiplayer matches. People griped about the release of the Forgotten DLC (which was previously a free fan-community mod), but it was really nice to see a game that came out around the turn of the century get some new, OFFICIAL content - how often does that even happen?  Great RTS title with awesome mechanics; you get a lot for your money too. :)"
An amazing medival startegy game. Played since the disc release and decided to pick it up on steam for some nostalgia.  Most prefered playing with family and friends.  WARNING-When playing online multiplayer beware of try-hards who have tirelessly put their whole life into mastering the game so that no one can beat them (just saying).
"Still a classic. I've worn through dozens of other RTS games, including the rest of the AoE series, but it's AoE II that I keep coming back to every year for 10 years. Still fun, still beautiful, still engaging. I can't recommend this game enough."
Good memories from the CD-ROM days. Good goooood memories
"Such a great game to play with friends. It's a bit of a challenge and has a tiny learning curve but it's just such a timeless game. If you are wondering if you should get it, do, and get your friends to as well."
Help! how do stop wolves from attacking my villagers?  9/10
There is not much I can say about this game except that it is extremely fun. I had this game on disc and spent countles hours playing. Anyone that has it can say the same as they find find themselves waisting hours playing it.
A great HD remake of a classic game. I am forever in love with this. If you're a fan of AOE2 and miss playing it online. Get this game!
Good Strategy Game. However the games can be a little too short for my liking. All around Good Game
Writing random stuff just to upvote this game  10/10
this game is cancer and i hate it 7.8/10 too much water
best $3 of my life
Loved the original since I was in 3rd grade. Happy to see that its community is coming back!
My girlfriend dumped me because of this game.
This game is really expensive
no doses not work on my high end pc
"You know this game, just buy it and leave."
I got an A+ in history class.
"If you didn't play Age of Empires 2 years ago then this is an excellent, old school rts that still stands up to todays standards. If you DID play AOE2 years ago expect this: the same great game with added graphics and content, no core changes"
I played this game a ton on Windows 98 and glad this HD remastered works well on any PC now days.
"You know those games you played as a kid and found them again as an adult and they sucked? They were photo realistic back in the day, but now they look like garbage? Yeah, this is exactly the opposite of that. This game is, in my mind, the king of all games. I have logged literally thousands of hours throughout my life in this game. Many an all nighter playing with friends. Relive your past (if you played this game before) or just make some awesome history for your future! And besides, how many games can you actually convince a school to install on all their machines for 'history' class purposes? I have honestly yet to run across a game better than this one, in my own humble opinion."
"The classic AOE with updated textures and a higher population cap. Plus with the Steam Workshop mods for even more content and HD Textures, of course this is great for RTS and map domination fans."
I played this game when i was a kid..... and keep playing it now.. WOLOLO  12/10 IGN -Would WOLOLO Again...
"Playid it for 10 years ago and keep playing it xD love it, and play with frineds is awesome"
"6/5 ez game ez lfe, would be 7/5 with sexslaves to soldiers."
"Despite the game being one of my favorites, I thought that after all these years the lag issue would be fixed. But as the name suggests, it seems only the graphics were updated. The lag becomes unbearable once too many units are on the map. There is a few second delay between every frame."
"Like a lot of people that played/are playing this, I have some good history with this game back in the day. Got it on sale for 2.99 (yeeesssss!) and from the moment I started playing it, I felt like it was 1999 again! Game still looks goo after all this time, and now that I'm older and wiser, I can fully enjoy it for what it is. I highly recommned this to everyone that like RTSs."
"After thousands of hours on my disk version, i decided to go digital, so here goes:  most certainly the best strategy game of all time, Age of empires 2 has deserved a remake for a long time, and while this widescreen (but not actually hd) remake is lacking in terms of new features. it does not take away from the original charm. Dont spend £20 on it though, buy it on the steam daily sale with the DLC for £2.84.  After playing it directly after the AOE 2 original retail version, here is my thoughts on its pros and cons compared to the original:  Pros: More resolution options for big monitors No longer needs to run in compatibility mode/can now switch between windows with ease. Revived multiplayer including a competetive rank Twich.tv integration Workshop support and new format means lots of new mods exclusive to the hd version such as texture packs Steam community meaning friends can invite you to games, you can take screenshots, read guides in game and so on  Cons: No lan laggy mouse Poor click detection Bugs main menu does not detect resolution unlike the ingame screen Overpriced   So overall, if you arent going to install many mods, play much online multiplayer or do any twitch streaming then get the original. Ideally i would recommend getting both so you have a LAN option. Happy Relic Hunting! "
"Ever since this update, everything is ♥♥♥♥ing bugged so bad, your almost compelled to say '♥♥♥♥ YOU STEAM WTF' i had about 280 hours in before they updated it with this trash and its safe to say im ♥♥♥♥ing done."
"Used to play Age of Empires all the time when I was in Middle School, this game is great and i would definitely recommend it to any one!"
Probably everyone knows this game from their childhood etc. and have very good memories. So now we have it remastered in HD and with full steam workshop support... what is more important - multiplayer is alive so if you liked it before you will fall in love with it again... for hours/days/weeks. Trust me. I did.
The best real time strategy game I have ever played. You can spend hours building up your army or be destroyed in 20 minutes of the game starting. Endless hours of enjoyment. Been playing this game for 10+ years
"i can't play it i played the old one and it was great but i cant play this one only the launcher comes up and when i click play it just gets rid of the launcher and does not open the game... waste of time and money so far.  if there is a way to fix this i will listen, but i tried every thing and it wont work."
"AoE 2 is in my opinion, the best out of the series. Best buy I have, played it since I was 12 and still enjoy it and the history it has; awesome game."
im sorry... but i want to know why i cant play it whit my friends anzmore online... :(  it says i have the wrong version.... but we all have aoe 2 hd version :O
"I havent played this much and im not a huge fan of strategy games, but this game is amazing. This is definetly worth the money."
"Get it, Its a good idea."
only get if you have friends to play with or you just love rts games. btw ♥♥♥♥ wolves
This game is a classic. Updated to run on new windows systems.
is it for mac?
The nostalgia is real.
this game is worth buying i will play with any one who gets this
Well I feel like they didn't really add any HD to this remake it's still a great game.
Loving the graphics!
the game really good
"I've played this game since it originally came out, when it was available ons team i jumped on the opportunity to play it again as the original copy no longer worked on more modern computers. It is the best strategy game out there in my opinion, the the best balance of everything. sometimes less is more, and this game is absolutely spot on. I would recommend it to any strategy game lovers, and to others in the hope to convert them! (wololo)"
I like to be a turtle.... so many castles.
CLASSIC
"This game is a very good choice if you want to play a strategy game, though it can get a little bit repetitive over time."
One of the best RTS games of all time! Still one of my favorite go-to games.
"I LOVE this game. I played the non-HD version from a disc, and now I play this version on steam. My only problems with this game are that forests are pretty much walls, and there are no zoom or orbit functions."
"This is one of my old time favourite games, its re-modeled form brings twice the experience to the user. Everyone who enjoys strategic-economic game tactics will enjoy this classic. Thumbs up."
♥♥♥♥ing Persia ♥♥♥♥ing War Elephants swear 2 god m8.
"This game is called Age of Empires II HD. In this game, you play as a lone monk who has the special ability of shooting wololos out of his eyes. In doing so, he gains the attention of two villager guards, who quickly start building bombard towers everywhere. I won't ruin the ending for you, but the everyone dies at the end."
"The game looks amazing, and plays incredibly. I haven't gone through the campaigns again yet, but so far it's everything I remembered about AOE2. A must have for RTS fans."
"How, in the name of God, with all the technological leaps over the years and loads of new tools to develope with. How is this game still one of the best (if not THE best) RTS experiences on the market? The bar was set in 99 and its still there, high up in the air.  "
Love this game! Me and my bf play it. The only thing i would say is that when a game diconnects everyone loses rank i think it would be fair if they could recognise you disconnected and punish them with loss of rank
"This is one of the classics. I don't know how many hours I put into the original version in my teens but it was definitely a whole bunch of them. Fast paced rts, with slightly unbalanced units :P There are cool scenarios for single player but it really shines in multiplayer. Attacking your friends puny soldiers with a horde of elephants or swarming them with the chinese special crossbowmen units never gets old."
It is simply AWESOME game. I play it all over again. Old habits die hard.
"Brings me back to the olden days... Yet today it is still a great game, easy and fun to play. I wouldn't fully recommend to buy the expansion, the forgotten empires, because the added campaigns are without voice-acting and a bit buggy"
One of the best RTS games of all time IMO.
"I remember a very certain part of playing Age of Empires - I was only five, and was playing against my older brother. He played normally, apparently. I being naive as I was, didn't know how to advance ages, so I pretty much stayed in the Stone Age building everything tons of times and training nothing but villagers. He sent a scout along, saw what I was doing, got his scout swarmed and promptly quit. This left a mark on me however, and I knew from the first day that I ♥♥♥♥ing loved playing Age of Empires. I'd make maps of nothing but giant armies clashing and blowing the PC up. I basically enjoyed it ever since I was a kid.  Naturally, when AoE II came out and pa brought it back, I was all over it. Played through everything and memorised all the cheats. It's been a staple in any of my games collections and I always had an Age of Empires near me, regardless of the series.  With that nostalgia out of the way, I'd like to review this game. Age of Empires II came out in September 1999 - just two years after the original AoE - by Ensemble Studios, and to rave reviews, IGN giving it an 8.8/10. It featured civilizations across Europe, Africa and Asia (and with the Conquerors the Americas), alongside campaigns that told the story of Joan of Arc, Saladin and William Wallace to name just a few. It didn't stray far from the original isometric view of its predecessor, but it did keep a pleasant looking graphical update, alongside some pretty damn important updates of its own. It isn't much at the time but there were selectable formations, queuable units and basically improved on everything that AoE originally done. As with the original Age of Empires, AoE II comes with a scenario creator, allowing you to create maps for anything you can desire, with triggers, diplomacy settings and an ability to share these maps on the internet. I'll be talking about this in a moment, but Age of Empires II really set the bar for RTS's (RTSes?) and expanded perfectly on what was already an excellent game.  Now that this HD edition has been around for a good couple of years, it's really time to see just what it did to change things up. For starters, the graphical updates. It's good that the resolution can be increased now, rather than being tethered to 1024 x 768, but there are some things that I felt weren't really necessary. For starters, the new '3D' water. It's pretty I guess. But it feels out of place with the rest of the scenery which almost conflicts with contrast. Smaller details like shadow rendering I pretty much just turned off after ten minutes, as it didn't add anything to the experience. The achievements are... nice. It's interesting to have but really, it doesn't feel right having them there anyway. It could be the age of the game, or it could be me. I'm iffy about acheivements.  There are things that really redeem AoE II: HD in my eyes however, apart from the 'modernization' of the game. If you're apprehensive about gameplay, don't fret - the AI have been vastly improved. If you want to take it easy, you don't have to put up with bots resigning because they accidentally spawned with male villagers only (or something). They are a lot more aggressive now, and it can be commonplace to have your base attacked early if you're not careful. They give you a chance, and it can be often where you can advance to the Feudal Age a few minutes before everyone else. The gloves come off after that, though. The HD edition also brings in a new map size 'LudiKRIS', which is as it sounds. I tried playing a map of that size and promptly had my laptop near freeze up. The population cap has also been increased from 200 to 500, letting you have that bit of an extra edge with more villagers spread out, or to field an uber-large army that can curbstomp pretty much anyone who looks at you funny. Smaller additions but still notable include a mirror civilization - so two players who are facing Koreans and Spanish will be Spanish and Korean, a campaign system that has combined the originals with the Conquerors' campaigns, an updated multiplayer system, and the best bit...  The Workshop.  One of the best things that the HD edition brought to the table is Workshop support. Not only does this mean you can download maps that other players created, but there are a plethora of other delicious, delicious DLC that you can snatch away - from texture packs that completely overhaul vanilla (original) unit designs, to taunt packs, to campaigns done with love and kisses. With the workshop the amount of hours you can play with Age of Empires can go through the roof. Try out Gwyndlegard (sic?) while you're checking the workshop out. You will not be disappointed by how enjoyable the scenario is!  To summarize, while the HD edition has some flaws, they're really miniscule in that you're still left with an amazing game that doesn't feel aged at all, with some fantastic additions that makes this comfy-tier base building RTS feel up to date again. Buy this game, it will NOT disappoint you!"
"Absolutely brings my favorite game as a kind to widescreen and 'HD', GET IT, GET IT NAOW."
Great game to play with friends.
"For those who lost or forgot about this game It's a great revitalization of an old childhood memory! The 'HD' part may be lacking on many apects of the game (menu, some units, and icons) but this game is (still) totally worth it! Play with friends, and others who bought back into the series in the re-fashioned online multiplayer and relive the AOE game that (at least for me.) started it all."
Epic Game. Deserves a way better Metascore than 68 or whatever it is
"A timeless classic, even after all these years it's still as good as i remember."
"If you're into RTS games, this is a classic, defenitly one of my favorites."
One of the best games I have ever played!
10/10 I've been playing this game now 16 years. I always seem to come back to it. The only negative is the lobby finding could be better.
"I bought this game even though it is pretty old. In my opinion, this is still one of the most fun strategy games there is. I played this as a kid and it knocks the socks off of the 3rd Age of Empires. It gets backs to basics and has a fun campaign."
"Best strategy game ever, been playing this for roughly 15 years now and still love it :)"
"Loaded up the game... chose a civilization, trying to figure out what to do besides building houses... built a mining and lumberjack thing and started mining/cutting wood. 5 minutes later I was ready to go to the Feudal Age and then I got raided by the enemy. 11/10 would play again (but not on a difficult level to begin with :3) :D"
Old but still perfect strategy to play :)
"Age of Empires II HD is one of those games where you forget how much time has passed playing it because it keeps you pretty hooked. It's very fun learning the different strategies, and it does a good deal for the RTS Genre in my opinion. All the civilizations have access to very similar units, with the exception of each civ's one or two Unique units.   The unit tactics are pretty straightforward, with each unit gaining an attack bonus vs other units (for example, Spearmen Infantry do bonus damage to Cavalry and mounted units), but besides the general units, there are other tactics to be used, like sending light cavalry to disrupt the enemy economy, placing archers behind walls/lines of infantry, etc.  Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who likes RTS games, as long as you aren't picky about 3D graphics. It will give you hours of fun, especially if you have a friend or three to play with or against. Definitely worth the price, I actually bought my brother a copy during the winter sale."
"One of the best old school games regardless to the nostalgia it brings, HD my ♥♥♥♥ though, it looks the exact same."
It's really fun if you enjoy RTS.
Get this game it is a classic
"At Thanksgiving during cleanup I snuck into the pantry where the trash was so I could scare whoever opened the door next. I totally expected it to be my wife's aunt or mother-in-law. As the door slowly opened I let out a low but powerful growl starting off low volume into a yelling growl. Well, her 80 year old grandma almost fell down and then she grabbed her chest. Fortunately she was physically fine, meaning no hospital visit required. Unfortunately she needed a change of clothes. After much embarrassment for both, although I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥less, her and my wife's grandpa end up leaving. On the way out of the driveway she's waiving to everyone and I'm last in line. When she gets to me she doesn't wave but instead turns her hand into a gun and starts air shooting me as they back out of the driveway."
Who doesn't like Age of Empires!?!?! One of the best games ever made. Really takes you back to the good ol' 90s.
"Beautiful, what they have done to a classic game. Love the Graphical improvements, and classic gameplay.  Will spend many many hours on this game!"
"Solid game. Much easier than keeping up patches on the old version, and online community present. Pretty cheap on Steam sales for 75% off too."
This game is awesome. You get to pwn Haochen in his little Chinese balls.
"If you're looking for a game that lets you build up an empire, create massive armies, solidify base defenses, look no further. It is a great game, although its only hiccup is the lag bug in Multiplayer, which I hope gets resolved at some point; still playable with low-normal population though.. bug is not present in Single Player matches. Still a great game nonetheless. Will be hard to find a game as fun as this one. Still giving it a 9.5/10."
"Just like my Childhood, spent an hour and a half amassing a Viking army ready to fight for glory or Valhalla, to watch as they decide the gods of old wheren't that good and Aztec gods are much cooler.   And then get killed by my own army.  10/10 would play again "
Just so good.
I love it the multiplayer works great and it also come with the conquerors expansion already unlike the actual cd-rom game. And you can choose to play co-op which is a great new feauture.
"Easy to have fun, damn hard to be good against solid AI or online. A great RTS with great inter-civilization parity. The best player wins and 'best' tends to be he with the most ability use the force of ADD for good as there is so much to focus on."
"One of the best strategy games ever, simply. Not much to say if you've played the original version, it's the same with better graphics. period. I would advise the 'The Forgotten' expansion if you can get it for cheap (0.70£ the other day)."
Converted an elephant and a building. 10/10
"First game ever played, lost the disc ages ago but Steam to the rescue."
A classic... I only wish there were more techs and battle units. Sometimes the simplicity of the game is to simple. 4.5/5
"played this game year's now and still one of the best around, top notch entertainment. if you like building,collecting,and attacking this game is for you, might look abit old compared to newer games but still packs a punch 5/5."
"It's a classic. Very in depth as well, from resource gathering to combat to the tech tree. One of my favorite RTS games for sure."
Ok this is awesome as i have it on PS2 aswell for yeaaaaars. nut this HD remake is good BUT. No resolution changer which is appauling and i would only buy it on sale (which i did) i still recommend as this is the best one.
This game's a classic.
Fantastic to have this game on Steam! My only critisism is why are we still waiting for the mac version?
It is great to play this game again with enhanced graphics and new empires [If you get FE]
need better players all ♥♥♥♥ cunts
"I didn't think I would like it at first, looked boring, but after playing it im addicted. So much fun to play with friends!"
"Bleh. There was a free community HD release already available, this doesn't have much extra. The ease of multiplayer is the only real reason to buy this. It's worth a few $ but not more. This is just a cash-in for a game that they already cashed in on years ago, except that this time they've done stuff all for it."
a pretty good retexturing of the original aoe2 though changing the keybindings made quite a few veterans (including me) dislike the game initially. overall 9/10
this game is very fun and takes a lot of skill.
Don't point that thing at me!
"I used to play this game all the time, and now it's back! YEEEESSS!!"
"Age of Emires 2 is a super RTS, which I have always enjoyed.   HD is a bit of an overstatement though. Overall it looks better, but not as much as i'd want it to... However, being able to choose my actual monitor resolution is fabulous ;-)   Too bad the LAN functionality has been removed in this version.  IF you already own it, I'd recommend playing the original Age of Empires 2 with the community patch or Forgotten Empires Expansion, which also enables the 'up-to-date' video settings."
You should play this game because....reasons.
"It's Age of Empires 2, what really needs to be said!"
i love this game it makes me feel nostalgic
Much strategy. such mine. many convert. so 11.
This is probably the best game ever and whoever you are reading this should buy it. It's great. Iv'e played an embarrassing amount of hours and it's still fun!!!
This game is PURE nostalgia and is every bit worth the price! buy and play!!!! 
An amazing game. It has been a lot of years since I played this game and I wasn't fond of it. I preferred the original. Now that I have went through the game and played a few times I find that I really missed these types of games and it is more of what I want in a game then I thought. I love how you can play this game solo and make it as easy or as hard as you wish to.
"Pro - Same wonderful game play that I loved years ago. Quasi- Con - I forgot most of the hot keys in the past decade. Actual Con - The editor's triggers and conditions do not work well. I am uncertain if they left that part of the code out, but they do not seem to work correctly."
"Fun, smooth, and true to the original. All of the DLC has revamped major portions of the game, while still retaining the original mechanics. Turbo random maps are perfect for session style gamers.  10/10"
"I've been playing Age of Empires off and on since the original released and it is always good to hop in for a short time and have some classic RTS fun. The HD edition leaves the core game alone and adds a few nice features, I highly recommend it to RTS fans (who have all played it already, I'm sure)"
"Great game, I love it."
"If you grew up with Age of Empires 1 &amp; 2, you don't need to read this to know what a great game this is.  On the other hand if you haven't heard about or tried this game yet: Which rock were you hid under during your childhood?"
Teutonic Knights. 'Nuff said. 10/10
aoe 3 is better tho
Amazing game; one of my favorites
"Awesome, I used to play this when I was younger and i loved it and now its in HD"
Extremely addictive strategy game!!
Very fun and very addictive. There's nothing quite like decimating another team with your friends :D
"One of the quintessential, must-have games of the RTS genre.   11/10 would spam petards again"
"It's the classic Age of Empires, compatible with modern hardware and Windows versions. What else can I say to convince you that this is a must-buy? :-)"
"That game is a historical piece of evolution of computer games! If you have played it in your childhood, you want to know what will be awaiting for you if you buy 'Age of Empires II HD'. The graphics are like in the old game but simply in high definition.   10 out of 10 points  Recommending it to everyone who likes strategy games and beside building a village making war."
"Classic rts that you can't go wrong with, play some custom games with friends."
+nostalgic +steam lobbys +best RTS ever  10/10 would buy
"This game is perhaps the best game that I have ever played. It never gets boring and it's just so much fun. I like the fact hat they have lots of civilizations and features that go with it, and a map editor. The only thing that I disliked is that they're not so specific on the civilizations, because I'm from Denmark and it would be nice to have Danish Vikings in the game. Although they do reference us in the history page yet the Danish Vikings were the best Vikings, and I'm not just saying that because I am Danish. I say that because lots of countrys used to quake in fear of the Danes. Now they think that we're the capital of Sweden."
LOVE IT :P only thing steam needs to do is make this system so you can play them online and offline
Never played the orignal but have played stragey games before and i am a lover for stragey games and tower defense games - this game has become my number one all time stragey game! Would happily recommend this game for anyone that has a passion for stargey games as i do!
An older game but is a lot of fun to play with friends and co-workers and kill some time..... would recommend to any person who loves strategic games.
Yeah old school game. play with cheats if you dont have patience like muah
My favorite unit is alfred the alpaca. The base game and the expansion is so worth the $30. Get it because of alfred the alpaca. he told you so
"This game is an awesome throwback to my childhood, but there is one thing folks should be aware of. Since they added a new expansion the hotkeys are all in the 'grid' set up instead of the old hotkeys so I find myself falling back to muscle memory and building random things as most of the hotkeys are different so that they could add the new units and technologies.   That being said once you get used to the new layout, or change it back to the old one it is a game I will probably end up spending another few hundred hours on as time goes by. Definately recommend."
Unleash your autism with this addictive classic RTS
"Age of Empires II, so many memories are returned with each game.   The game engine shows age even in HD, but I'm willing to forgo that for the good times I've had in the past and in the future.    9/10 Will play agian! "
Cut apart battering ram with carving knife as Forager    10/10
AOE II in 'HD'.... HD as in... 1920x1080 resolution.  All we need is an AOE 4 with modern graphics and a physics engine.... keep the gameplay the same.
It is a classic. I played it since 6. I like it very much.
"Oldschool RTS, enjoyable but the bots are so hard in Random match. ;-;"
"It´s like having sex with a good ex-lover that you knew her well but now has new tricks under her sleeve, love it."
"I played this a ton as a kid, and fell in love with it entirely. I've never played as much of the the others in the series, but this is by far my favorite. I really like all the campaigns, and the multiplayer mode is quite good, but what really keeps me playing is the replayability of random map games. Using different cultures, maps, numbers of players, and even creating a map are all fantastic ways to play the game repeatedly without it ever getting old. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys games like Dawn of War or the Total War Franchise."
Best RTS of all time.
Awesome Game right from the childhood
It is my favorite game so far. Thank you engineers and others who helped make this possible. Very good job!
This game introduced me to PC when I was 6. 11/10
Loved this game when I was younger! Love it even more now!
Brilliant game super fun might find it a bit slow paced but probably because i suck.
"This is a game from my childhood and really it lived up to all my expectations playing it again. It's challenging and fun and can get down right frustrating. But I like to plaay it when I get sick of my other games (meaning rage quit),"
Fun! But need work whit the multiplayer D:
"It's Fun, best rts ever, when played with an Espur...  "
"Same old AoE we all know and love, this could either be good or bad from your point of view, but personally, i enjoy the steamworks integration and having a digital copy of this wonderful classic"
"Great game, wish I had more time to play it."
"As a child I had many games I enjoyed. Most games I enjoyed were real time strategy (RTS) and turn based strategy. I came across Age of Empires by accident (the original) and it was for 9 bucks... so I begged my dad to let me get the game, After a while he gave and and I fell in love, and I was rather good at it. Being able to jump on one computer and fight against my brother on another was an amazing achievement (in my mind). Years down the road my family was on facation and I saw Age of Empires: Age of Kings on the shelf. I absolutely had to have it. So spending 30 dollars on a game (which was the most I ever spent at that time) I purchased the game. As soon as I got home I spend the next few hours watching as the install happend (took way longer at that time than it does now). And to my amazement this game was better. It was at this point I was dedicated to the game. Now enough of a back story how is my rating going to go?  When I rate a game I generally rate it on select criteria. These are as follows Advertisement - How did the game stick out to me making me want to buy it Simpliciy - As a game it should be simple and easy to play as well as challenging in it's own way Gameplay - How does the game play in general Re-playability - if I'm giving my hard earned money to a game I want to be able to play that game over and over Campain - (if available) as original as games were created themselver there has always been a 'story' and the story of built into a campaign is an intergal part of enjoying the tale the game has to tell. Graphic - Not a core detail I care for however asthetics definitly help for bonus points  I have not come up with an official numbering system to my rating as I'm figuring out so we are going to go over each and I will give my choice on the following levels  Must Have - This game is truly amazing and you must have it in your gaming arsnal Good to Play - Played it and loved it would recommend it but you be fine if you don't get Ok Game - The game's ok I guess... I'm not really recommending it, but if your board enough go ahead Avoid - The game is really not that good avoid it if you can Avoid and burn - This game is so terrible that if I could I would burn every copy so please help me if possible.  So lets break down Age of Empires II HD  Advertisement  So as I have already stated I loved the game from the begining, what sold me on the game was a sale. As far as in this day and era most re-released games with upgraded graphics are for those who loved the game before others took it's place. So the idea of a classic with better graphics definitly stands out. Beging at a higher resolution and picture quality definitly helps, but in retrospect for new gamers definitly doesn't stick out, because at the core the graphics are not that of a 'modern RTS'  Simplicity  Controls are fairly simple (if your use to RTS) and the tech tree that is specific to each culture is definitly an aspect that adds dynamic to the game. It does have quite a bit of strategy, and if you start getting to the higher setting of difficulty it can get tedious to play after long hours just trying to find the one villeger or ship that's hiding in the corner doing nothing.  Gameplay  The game play is exactly how I remember it. Smooth, yet rough. The characters have basic animations that doesn't give the smooth look like some of the modern gamesl ike SCII however the sprites move in a fashion that makes up for this. And the sequences of battles enterties and makes the gameplay interesting. The computer AI is rather dumb, and sometimes can be quite annoying, and the only difference between difficulties is how quickly the computer attacks or collects resourses. However all the AI battles in the same fasshion, so no changes in dynamics or tactics making the VS AI rather dull. However the multiplayer against other human stll has it's fun. This game is very susseptable to 'Rush' attacks and if your not too careful you will lose a lot, so timing and planning is very important. Games can take a long time, but they are still fun in general. The tech tree system is different for each culture you choose giving some bonuses and disatvantages to some culture, and the vairety is awsome.  Re-Playability  The game definitly has some re-playability for the multiplayer, however the campaign doesn't make me want to do it over and over.. After beating the AI several times it does get rather dull once you figured out the best strategy of attack. However multiplayer is always interesting against others.  Campaign  As mentioned the campaign(s) are not to replayable, and for me they can be tedious at times, however the captivating way they blend the gameplay with history definitly is a fun, and if your love history enough you may become interested in reading about the famous battles you fight in the game. However each capaing is a play through once and your done, but the choices and variety of campains definitly allow plenty of time to enjoy.  Graphics  As this is an upgrade the textures visuals and styles are upgraded beyond that of the original making it 'eye candy' for those who have played the original for years. However if you compare this to some modern RTS and even some from back around the same period you may think the graphics are subpar, however this game definitly has it's own style of graphics and they flow well for the gameplay.  Overall I would definitly recommend this game as a Good to Play. For those who played it in the past and love the AOE franchises definitly a must have however for those who just found this game and want a good RTS to play try this game out for size. You will like it and it can be fun.  I hope this review can help you if your on the fence about this game."
"A timeless classic - This is a must buy on sale because for me it means I don't have to frantically search for my retail CD and the key hastily written on a slip of paper, always so perilously close to being lost. I have sunk countless hours in to this game over the years since it was originally released and was part of MSN LIVE CD games. It is a true RTS classic.  Steam workshop makes installing and managing mods much easier to boot. Enhanced graphics, classic gameplay, and a bright future. I can only hope that someday Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds gets the same treatment."
Really awesome!!
WARNING: THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH 20$! This game is worth about ten dollars.
"This is a classic game, but I'm terra-bad at it. I dunno what I do wrong, but I always get my butt kicked. wah.  10/10 would lost over."
Nice to have an up-to-date version of this timeless legendary game.
"So many memories from years ago... A masterpiece, if you like strategy games such as Civilization, this is the game for you.  10/10"
My favorite RTS game on PC! Recommend to anybody who loves stragety games
grate game play but lots of problems with the ai E.G. the ai can make an hole army with in 2 minuts of starting the game
"Classic Age of Empires, revamped with improved graphics, smooth gameplay, and multiplayer capability. The online multiplayer can occasionally take some time to connect, but for an older game like this, it's only a very minor flaw. And with the expansions, this is definitely a game with many hours of replayability.   Highly recommended."
Make everyone cry with a Hun Rush
"If you're an AoE II fan then go for it. But for anyone else, there's much better alternatives."
"I've loved this game since I was a kid. I'm happy I can play it with friends online, now. It's a great nostalgia trip"
"much like Warcraft, Starcraft and Command&amp;Conquer, AoE2 is absolutely a MUST HAVE for any fan of RTS games, furthermore the 'HD' edition really makes it enjoyable on modern PCs  8/10"
FANTASTIC game! Its a must have for sure!
Simple and easy to understand. You and your friends will have fun with this one. That fun includes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pillaging eachothers villages. Not a big fan of the online because I like to take things slow but with people you know this game is hilarious.
one of my favorite games of all time. its always been my go to game when i finish a game. or just want something to do for a while.
"Same classic game, now works with higher resolutions."
"The HD part isn't very visible. But it is still a fun game though. If you don't have it already, then buy this one."
Good Stuff
"Pretty rad update, loving the 500 pop cap!"
It's a great remake of the classic. Easy to learn and get in to it. Difficult to master. Definitely buy.
Just as good as it was years ago.
Great game
"Don't expect anything too HD with this release. It gives the game current resolutions, support for mods, and overall better textures. In those aspects, the game has improved. Unfortunately the pretty dated AI and pahtfining is intact, seeing no improvement.   With the mention of mods, it does add a layer to the game, and if you've been playing on a newer PC from an original disc copy it does alleviate the dreaded purple water issue. I also never saw it mentioned on the product page, but the base game is the original and both original expansions in one, so it has a lot of content.   Just as addicting as the first one, but don't expect very many graphical options that change the feel of the original game."
"This game is totally worth picking up just for the nostalgia, and it's so god damn good (single player wise) that even after 15 years I can still lose track of time while playing."
this game so much lagging when you have massive population with ludakris map but i still enjoy this game.
"Don't get me wrong, I think this is an awesome game. I love playing as japan especially, but what I dont understand is why it has so much more fans than age of empires 3. I personally feel that 3 is superior in every way to this already amazing game, so why does this game get all the glory? why is it that there are so many more features, such as workshop and achievements, available for this and not 3? i really love this game, but ive played this for about 16 hours, while i've gotten well over 100 in age of empires 3, and never get board of it. that being said, if you can't decide wether or not to get this game, i highly recommend it. edit: so after playing this a bit more i realized i was being a bit unresonable of my judgement of it. it is truely a great game and if you can't deside wether to get it or not i highly recomend it"
The best strategy game ever...
"This a great example of an older RTS game. Despite its title, it's not actually 'HD'. But considering this game is at least 10 years old, the graphics are half decent. Plus there's the added bonus of Mongol Mangudai hordes overrunning a Turkish castle in the middle of a snowy pine forest. Or some random ♥♥♥♥ like that."
ONE OF THE BEST RTS I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do not waste your money on AOE 2 HD edition. The devs do not care about the performance of the game and constantly break it with new patches. I have posted numerous times in all the discussion threads for the game and have not had a single dev comment on any of my issues. They appear to have little knowledge of anything and constantly blame Ensemble Studios for the issues that did not even exist in the original game.  The game worked fine in version 3.9.
"This is a great game. The campaigns are all great. There is not much HD about this remake but at least it runs properly without problems with compatibility and color (which are issues I've faced trying to run the original on Windows Vista onwards). Moreover, the game is being actively patched. I can count on my fingers the number of big releases/remakes that get patched this frequently and after such a long time after release."
"Welcome back to the good times, old school RTS nostalgia your thing? Now on steam with added workshop functions and custom user made maps. Also in fantastic HD to dazzle your eyes with its perpetual beauty.  Lagless servers and Elo matchmaking make this game incredible fun in multiplayer (plus you can also use the cheats if needed for a little assistance)  Highly recommend this to everyone who has even a passing interest in RTS."
"If you're looking for a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing strategy game, look no further. Seeing as how it's still one of the best strategy games available after being out for this long should tell you this game is great. This is much better than any strategy game you've played, unless you play XCOM or the Empire series. Of course if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can go play such prestigious games such as Stalin vs. Martians, or Halo Wars. K. Tanks. By."
It's I8
"Hello Everyone ! I Highly recomend getting this game ! if you like RTS games buy it ! When i was just a little boy i used to play this with my mom ... Damn this game is soooo good SMOOTH gameplay , repetitive gamplay to , Extremly addicting ! Also so nice to just play over and over again and compete againsed others online ! When you get board of a Civ You just go to the next :p If you have played all the civs and board of playing !? dont be you can download a bounch of comunity made free maps mini games and more ! So many endless posibilities ! This game is by farr the best game i have ever played ! BTW the develipers are amazing and cool and they want to make you happy ! Thank you so much for reading this and i hope you buy this game !"
Fun game but valve servers suck too much to play this
You have the power to make your own units commit suicide. You truly are a god with this game.
"Solid game. A classic redetailed in HD. If you love strategy games, then you will like this. I might add that the gameplay style is compeltely different from Total War series. This game is a more classic build-your-base and gather recources game and then go for there."
"Remake of Age of Empires 2 with the Conquerers Expansion included. I wouldnt really call it a remake, more of a touch up, some stuff has been altered and it can now run fairly smoothly without any hitches on newer systems. Worth the money, A classic that still holds pretty well considering its age."
its good.
Love this classic game.
"The Age of Empires Series is like the Grand Series of all RTS games.   The economy/military aspect is very much important in this game. Fails your economy, your military units will be smashed into pieces and the other way around.  The best balance must be found... and then my friend... you will be the true ruler of all Empires!  So... what are you waiting for? Get Age of Empires 2 HD where you can be the ruler of 18 civilisations, in 9 campaigns with 57 scenarios and a great Multiplayer action!"
"Strongly recommend AOE2 HD to anyone who has ever liked RTS style games. The upgrades made to AOE2HD make this game worth the purchase, even if you already own AOE2... Things like full screen and steam integration for multiplayer make life a breeze. If you don't own this, get it!"
"Look, It's Age of Empires II. Enough info."
"NOSTALGIA !! Loved it as a child, loved it as a teen, and still loving it. A few good games don't need to be 'upgraded' with a ♥♥♥♥♥on of DLC's, new engine remakes. Some games are just good old fashioned good.   This being a wonderful example."
"Really amazing game to play by yourself, or with friends. The fact that I can keep coming back to this game and enjoy it is just awesome, not many games can do that. Since I have owned this game since something like 2007, I will say and continue to say that I love it."
"Absolute classic, get it and give me a game!"
"Really awesome classic game, if you ever played Age of Empires in your childhood you love this!"
Quite difficult but enjoyable. AI cheats which makes it very interesting.
"The best RTS you could play. Hasn't aged a bit,"
"THIS IS AOE, PLEASE GET IT AND PLAY WITH ME I'M SO LONELY."
"Although, this brings back nostalgic memories, and endless hours of fun. This remake, has one huge flaw, feels like hd graphics arent finished, and when you reach couple of houndrets of units on the map, it starts to lag, and fps drops to like 9fps. When fps is that low, it is nearly impossible to play.  My computer isnt high end or anything, but considering the 15+ years old engien i should be able to play this on my mobile without any problems.  Nice to have it in better graphics, but it needs adjustments. I still recommend it, it is still an awesome game."
"Amazing Game from my child hood, revamped less lag and more troops awesome! 10/10"
Not sure where the HD is on this game.
"Unless you already own the original Age of Empires 2 game, this is a great value buy. But its practically a re-release. There are very few changes other than workshop. But still very good."
♥♥♥♥ the critics who gave AoE a 68. Best RTS ever made.
Walked across the entire world with goats 11/10
"What a great game. It really adds to the series, expeshaly the DLC The Forgoten. You can always have a great time playing this game."
This is one of the best classics coming back to life. I would love to see thousands of people playing this again.
 Classic RTS!   
"This is a great revision of an old classic. The AI Is highly improved and much more challenging, and the new content is great for people like myself who are heavy into scenario design. There were lots of things unlocked in map maker that existed on the original game (and expansion) official scenarios, like sea walls and gates for wooden walls, that are unlocked. But there are also tons of new things to use, including fire towers (think the fire ships turned into towers), a new fortified wall type, new 'non-buildable' buildings to flesh out large towns with, and many of the wonders can be built as regular buildings without wonder-status, perfect for epic siege battles against towns.   As for the campaigns, I've only played some of the new official scenarios, but they're much more difficult and more 'modern' in design. Instead of just having basically a standard game with technology tree limitations and some scripted goals, they are much more military-mission like in design, with a more linear play though. They remind me of Real Time Tactics games instead of traditional RTS style missions.  The new civilizations they added in the expansion are also great. They add the Italians, which are my new favorite civ, as well as a couple of civ from Easter Europe, a new Native American civ (Incas), and India as playable Civilizations. This is a great thing for international players who may have felt left out by the western European and East Asian focus of the original game. As a whole, for the price point it is at, it’s a great way to relieve a classic game that has been brought up to date to offer new and exciting challenges.  "
It's AoE. In HD. It's still awesome and you should buy it. What more is there to say?
Classic.
This game brings me back. Still awesome with great replay value.
"Low FPS sometimes (Win 7, A83850, HD7870).  Otherwise, great trip down memory lane and it's still fun to play with friends. Steam integration makes things a breeze on multiplayer. Use the Conqueror's AI if you want to have any chance at winning a bot game."
Excellent classic RTS. Played this for years and I am still not tired of it.
One of my favourite games as a kid and probably what got me hooked on RTS games so I had to get this HD release. Not much different from the original so it's probably best to purchase if you see it on sale.
King ferdinand was destroying my kingdom then he resigned 10/10
great old classic!!! so much fun playing
"Wow! I haven't played this in forever! Finally a game on Steam that actually allows multiplayer without the going through servers b.s., or at least from my past experiences anyways. I haven't tried the DLC content yet, but I can't wait to get back into this even more so than I did then.  RTS gaming with lots of options to choose from in terms of civilization, weaponry, etc.. A quick think-on-your-feet way to go head-to-head with friends and other players alike! Are you ready to rule and conquer? Give it your best shot with AoE2 in HD!!"
Playing this game with your mates is amazing xD SO Much fun! Played it today for 2 hours with my mate and its was hailours! Must get if you have a mate that has it or just get it and get your mate to get it! TOO MUCH FUN! xD 10/10
Great game with friends (;
"An excellent game! I can't really add to what some of the other positive reviews are saying: It's classic, endless playability, yet quickly becomes familiar and easy to improve your performance. It's an incredibly satisfying game to play, and the option of allying with other players and combining your empires, armies and tactics is so fun. The random maps are all unique and cool to explore and use geography to your advantage. The economy / military balance is extremely intriguing as well.  If you've played the original, it is not any different except some of the graphics are smoother, the max pop cap is at 500, and there is support for online multiplayer and a thriving community both in-game and in steam workshop.  Cons: There is an annoying unit selection limit, (like 30 units?) and the continuity when playing multiplayer online is dependent on everyone having a fast connection. If even one player has a slow connection or slow computer, the game will lag very badly, especially when many units are on the map. Even with adequate connection speeds, I wouldn't reccomend setting the pop cap much over 300 in a 6 to 8 player game.  Redeeming fact: They are working on patches and continuing support for the game. Playability and technical issues have been improved and will hopefully continue to improve."
"Love this game! love this new enhanced version of it, Totally makes it work perfect on newer pc's now!"
Very good game. For those who have been in love with the strategy in 2000's
"Same game, on widescreen monitors, as always is THE KICKASS GAME"
Classic Awesome and worth endless hours of play! oh the nostalgia!!
"Hope you hate your friends, becuase they're either with you in this or not.  Age of Empires 2, (called simply Ages by most) is a remake of the original, great game. One of the best parts about the game is how easy it is to slip into. Nothing complicated to think about. Your villagers, your army, and 4 rescources. Pretty simple. But besides the fact the game is simple, it's very hard to master. The game is easily extremely hard if you choose to make it. But every time you play you're sure to slowly develop better tactics. And speaking of every time you play, matches can take a LONG time. Short in Ages is about 2 hours. 'You played 2 hours to lose like that!' But anyway, if you're looking for a great strategy game that doesn't take a long time to grip, give Ages a shot."
"Fun game overall, while it has bugs, if you have nestelgia for AOE2, you will enjoy HD"
"There's not much that makes it HD....the graphics are still as 16-bit and pixilated as ever before. Interface does expand, and I'm playing at 1600X1200 (my current monitor resolution), and it shows a great part of the screen.  Don't expect this to be any prettier than the gold old-fashioned AOE2 for Windows 98...because it's not. But, it is the most updated version (including all the upgrades you can purchase within each building). A great, classic game, as always!"
"Great game everything i remembered as a kid, i got it for 19.99 about a month ago i dont regret it one bit even if they just dropped it to 4.99 &gt;.&lt; GF STEAM GF."
"Yes, I love it"
"I've spent too many hours playing this game in the past and now that is back in HD I recomend this game fully. A classic stratagy game that will test your wits, cunning and provide hours of fun. A must have!"
Brings back so many memories. Great game.
"Best real-time strategy game ever in my opinion. Probably gonna get hate for this, but f*ck Starcraft. This is where it's at."
"I loved this game as a kid but it has aged a bit. Saying this is an HD edition is stretching it, I cant really tell a difference between teh regular and HD versions. Its nice to have a nastolgia rush but other then that you might as well pick up AOE 3"
"The hands-down best RTS of all time, now in with best presentation that it has yet had."
.
"Just as challenging as I remembered, now with nicer graphics. Still one of the best multi-player RTS's I've played."
"Now that the major lag issues have been fixed, this game is a haven for all you old RTS nuts. You can spend hours and hours in a day everyday just going at it. Whether it be castles or cavalry this game has not lost any of its charm. Then if you're up for a little more, the brand new expansion 'The Forgotten' brings 4 new campaigns with some all new factions. 14+ years on it's still one of my favourite games!!"
"Bring back some good memories, game play is excellent much harder than i remember, graphic are nicely improved running it on a 40' tv with no issue what so ever"
"I loved this game when I had it back when I was young, I love it even more now, and I can test myself and try complete the game on higher difficulties :D Just buy this game, it's one of the best RTS games out there."
"Perfection remastered. It's an unbelievable feat of work that now works with Windows 7, say goodbye to the magenta water and say hello to no 200 pop limit. I loved this game as a kid and I love it now. It's strategy at full fruition. The balance between Military, Society, and Economy are all crucial in this game and it's a great challenge for anyone of any skill level. Competitve is a little ridiculous for any newbie, but we all have to start somewhere. So go on, play it, do it and I promise you, you won't be disappoined.            Oh yeah, WOLOLOOOOOOO"
Great old school game.
if you like time consuming games with friends this is jsut for you. &lt;3 
Is a classic game of plans and counter measures. And of course being the one survives...
YOLOLO!!!!  Play this to test friendships.
"This game holds quite a bit of nostalgiac value to me, as well as genuinely enjoying the gameplay. I certainly recommend this game, but be wary of the little changes to the actual game. While they increased the population limit to 500, they did not increase the max amount of units can select. Also, the AI is just as doofy as ever. The biggest problem I probably had with it is the fact that the AI seems omnipotent at any given moment. It seems like there's no handicap against the bots, them immediately complete tasks, crapping out ground soldiers and ships like there's no tomorrow. Maybe I'm just a tiny baby-man who can't 'git gud', but I have a distinct memory of being able to run a train on the AI without cheats. All in all, it's a great game, just don't pay $19.99 for it."
It's a fantastic strategy game but with some major online issues that are slowly beeing worked out by the devs.
one of my all time favorite games.
I highly recommend this game if you love RTS or outsmarting your oppentent. There are plenty of stats to read as well to find out how and why your troops win and lose. the game has plenty of campians to try even the tutorial is a campain for beginners of the game of RTS.
Good remake of the classic
"Lots of issues with texts not displaying in game while using VirtualBox. Cannot play on retina on win xp, probably due to DPI settings not really matching. Spent a lot on trying, reading internets (just see how many people have same issues - not only mac users), to no avail, unfortunately. I do realise this is for Windows, but lots of stuff is for Windows and it runs smoothly under VirtualBox. To me it's one pointless purchase."
I've been playing this game for years and I still get cravings to play it. I totally recommend this game. It never gets old and now it is even better because it's in HD.
One of my favorite games of all time.
I killed an elephant with a camel...sweet.
"I've been addicted to this game since forever. This RTS is simply classic, it's hard to get sick of it. It's not complex in any major way what so ever. It's basic and works the way any classic RTS should. Even if you're not a hardcore RTS fan, and want a relaxing one to play casually, it's a great choice. Competitive players also enjoy this game, partly for it's balance."
I've played this game too much
"Despite its age, this game holds up really well, and with 4 or more players in a match, things can get pretty hectic! would definitely recommend either for nostalgia value, or if you're a fan of the RTS genre."
This is a complete re-write of the fantastic old Age of Empires II game which now barely works on Windows 7 or higher. This edition supports the Steam workshop which allows you get customize the experience maybe even closer to how you may remember playing the game. It's a fantastic game and this edition can almost do justice to the original I spent so many many hours playing as a child.
like the best game ever
"Yes, just amazing and fabulous."
Very good game. Great that it was remade.
"As it may take a long time to play, it gets very addicting. It's really fun, you really fell in controll of everything that ever goes on. It takes some getting used to, but it's really, really fun."
Great update of an old classic.
"Played this game when I was a kid, and its nothing less of a thrill to play it again as an adult. Always something far too satisfying than building up your culture, an watching others burn~"
"It's AOE2, must i give you another reason to buy the HD edition??"
This is my childhood. I have a picture of myself playing this when I was four years old... not sure how i played it... but i did and with the new HD aspect its even better now!
Classic old school RTS game.
its so much fun :D &lt;3
Pretty much my childhood. I love this game so much. The epitome of a well made RTS.
You should all buy this right now.
"It may be old but it holds itself quite well and owns nothing to any other newer game of its genre. Well made mechanics, pleasant soundtrack, very user-friendly interface and comes with a level editor for the players to create their own maps as they please if they get bored of the game's singleplayer campaigns. Speaking of singleplayer, the game also features multiplayer. You can ally with friends to win a map or battle between yourselves to see who's the best strategist. Hours and hours of fun are granted with this classic from the 90's. And if you need a break, the game allows you to save your progress on a map whenever you wish and resume from where you left off. Definitely a must-have if you like strategy games. Best strategy game of all time!"
"like the old aoe2, but shinier"
"Game is great, so glad they remastered this on steam"
Started playing this game 15 years ago. You'll never get tired from this one!
"Until I started playing Starcraft II, AoE II was the only PC game I played until High School. Between that, Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zooo Tycoon, this game took up days of playtime in my youth. Albeit, there are some frame rate issues and some issues in multiplayer that I've heard about, though not myself experienced, if you want to play what I consider one of the best RTS games made, I'd make it a definite buy, especially during summer sale. You can't beat 75% off."
The Workshop for this game is amazing!!! =D
"A classic RTS that I can finally play again after all these years. Simple to play yet with enough intricacy to make each battle different (I've never played the campaigns :P). Regicide is mmy personal favourite, in the black forest. Haven't you bought it yet?!"
"Almost as good as the original, love the extra content. Too bad it doesn't feel as much as an HD make of the game as I'd hoped."
love it.. played it when i was young and its pure nostalgia :)
This game is my favorite RTS of all time. I played it when it first came out when I was a kid and I am glad to see it staying alive with this HD remake. The online play can be a little buggy at times but other than that I like the new features and visuals added to the game.
"This is still the game you fell in love with when it first hit the shelves. The community may never be as big as it was when it was on Zone. However, this is still the same game if not better because they are constantly updating and adding new elements into the game, if any bugs did exist they are promptly fixed. Its worth the money because you will end up spending a ton of time on it, just a game you can easily jump into."
"Good game with many hours of play time.   I play with friends as I don't really like the campaign, but you might :)"
I love this game. Played it everyday as a kid.
After only about three hours of playtime I can already see the improvements made to this game. The graphics were beautifully redone and the AI is vastly improved.
"This game is pure nostalgia, if you never played it before it might be difficult to enjoy. It hasn't aged all that well but its still very fun especially the multiplayer. Get it right now while its on sale if you mean to."
Played since I was about 7 or 8 and still love to play it especially againist other people online were every person fights differently unless you play the deathmatch gamemode. LOL
it blows pp
"This game is my child hood, it's just like I remember it. It is a fun game for just doing random stuff and its more fuin with cheats. The campaign is also really fun."
this game never gets old people should tottalyget this 10/10
"A great laid back Strategy game. When they say HD Remaster don't expect anything too fancy, but the game definently has aged much better than many of the other hit games of the early 2000's. 8/10"
10/10
One of my first PC games. Fun to play with friends. And tons of mods for graphics and stuff. Grab it on a sale for nostalgic gameplay.
Punched a castle until it caught fire. 10/200 b/c the huns
This is a semi-historic Strategy game with multiple different ways to play the game both as a single player or in a multi-player mode. I think the HD graphics are an improvement. I like the upgrade/research options and the different difficulty options for the AI in this game.
cant beat classics
"Solid RTS, great way to waste hours of your life."
This is a great throwback. AOE2 was what got me into computer games. The mods take the game to a whole new level.
"An excellent game that teaches a lot about history and the rise and fall of civilizations through its mechanics. It doesn't live up to the HD part, but is an absolute must play if you are at all interested in history or real time strategy games."
Amazing. Now if only they would do Zoo Tycoon HD.
Great Game! 
Just as fun as I remember it. Hours of fun and frustration
"This is a good improvement from the good ol' AoE games from my childhood, this version have increased the graphic quality and modified the multiplayer function in a great way.  It's still just as fun as before, with alot harder competition with the new online multiplayer function.   "
one of the best RTS games ever
"As much as I love this game, the HD remake offers little in terms of perks from the original game. However, I found it hard to complain as I nosedived into the true #1 RTS game on the market. What's good about it? New matchmaking, 500 player cap, and some mildly improved textures allow this game to feel competent and managable on modern platforms, and give the player some more choices to play with friends. What's bad about it? The 20$ price tag is ridiculous for what is essentially a texture bump. Buy this item ONLY when it is on sale, otherwise you are wasting your money."
"My favorite RTS game ever, now in HD with new armies to play with! This is gold for any RTS fan!"
"This game is really fun, but it is really hard! Even so, it is a real nostalgic treat :- )"
Great game
It's the awesome classic real-time strategic game. I recommend it strongly!
"Every bit as good as when I first played it. If you missed it the first time around, this is a must buy."
"Excellently crafted game, challenging AI at times yet still fun also amazing with friends"
AoE 2. What more can you say?
Just as good as the orginal with a graphics upgrade. Still one of the best RTS on the market.
Awesome and will always be! A game that will live on forever :D
"One of my favorite's growing up, and definitely still a favorite now."
"If you are a fan of strategy games, this is worth looking into. Old school gameplay with improved graphics. Campaigns are frustrating and challenging at the same time. The downsides are the game mechanics. It is a bit clunky especially during massives battles and the HD version is still not as good as it should be."
"I never thought it would be possible to play this even more now than I did when I was younger, but holy crap is this game still awesome. Got it for 5 bucks during 2013's winter sale, and got my money's worth and more; even better, the extra campaigns, maps, and especially civilizations included with The Forgotten expansion make it even better than I remember. Time has aged well for you, Age of Empires 2. Wish I could say the same for your brothers 1 and 3."
"From the first PC game i ever played (When i was like 5 years old) to a HD re-release on steam, this game never gets old and you learn to look past the 2.5D graphics to enjoy the gameplay."
"Played for hours and just can't stop! It's the kind of game that never gets old, and multiplayer is excellant!"
Even though this game doesn't have an amazing score on metacritic doesn't mean it isn't amazing... This Game is a classic and now with steam workshop the possiblities are almost endless. A must own for all serious PC gamers.
"A classic for every PC gamer, 'must have' ."
"Great game, Had many hours of fun playing this through high scool. Nice too see it has been visually updated and an expansion pack has been added after so many years."
reliving my childhood
"Honestly, I love this game ALOT. But this is just a cheap port over to steam to make money, no proper balancing or bug fixing if you ask me, they could've done it so much better. If you're an old player looking to experience the game all over again, yeah go ahead and buy it. If you're a new player who's new to the game, please just avoid it."
"My villagers started uprising due to lock of pay a poor working conditions, causing a civil unrest and forcing me to resign.  10/10 would play again."
Teamed up with the Japanese while playing as the Chinese. 10/10.
"Loved AOE, shame Microsoft didn't support it after MSN games network stopped. Really appreciated playing this classic again."
"Oh god where to start, i played this when i was much smaller, back in the trial version for this game which is still out there a good 10 years ago, whereas i bought the 10$ from walmart but sadly it doesnt run on windows 7!!! Horrible coloring! So i decided to buy this and just wow, first of all, WOLOLOLO!! Being a big time AoE fan, i must say, that will never get old. I loved Age of Mythology aswell but the reviews really kill the mood for me buying it since it is 10$ higher than this one, but i would buy it if it drops to 20$ hopefully. This game runs perfectly, love it, love everything, but while i played online, i had some delay/lag when i played throughout the entire match which made it a little discomforting, but still playable (your units go everywhere if an enemy comes running along). But yeah, buy the game, 20$, ofcourse, brilliance, love it, buy it.  PS: All yall AoM fans, i hope you remember the 999 theme, for it was as godly as wololo!"
"I adore Age of Empires 2, been playing it since I was very little, and this HD version is amazing. Everything is formatted the same, the familarity is just a great feel and its so nice and refreshing to see actual green grass and blue water, completely free of odd neon blue purple pixelated splotches. ITSM TOTALLY GREAT   _and this game is taking over my life again_"
"Fun, smooth, and true to the original. All of the DLC has revamped major portions of the game, while still retaining the original mechanics. Turbo random maps are perfect for session style gamers.  10/10"
"I've been playing Age of Empires off and on since the original released and it is always good to hop in for a short time and have some classic RTS fun. The HD edition leaves the core game alone and adds a few nice features, I highly recommend it to RTS fans (who have all played it already, I'm sure)"
"Great game, I love it."
"If you grew up with Age of Empires 1 &amp; 2, you don't need to read this to know what a great game this is.  On the other hand if you haven't heard about or tried this game yet: Which rock were you hid under during your childhood?"
Classic! Since AoEO has gone offline I Bought AoE II on Steam and I am really enjoying it.   There are many features from AoEO I miss very much but until the AoE series releases a new title AoE II is where its at folks
One of the best RTS games of all time. Nothing else to say.
"Anyone who is anyone claiming to be a gamer has heard of, if not spent a multitude of hours as a Mongol, or Aztec warrior defending their keep from hordes of enemies! Revisit your childhood / early adulthood with this remastered classic! 10/10 +1 Nostalgia rating!"
"For those of you who miss the old times, and want to keep LANning old-style. Multi issues resolved (ooooohw, yeah !), graphics ameliorated (slightly)."
It's the original AoE II only better. Better graphics and total fidelity to the things that made AoE amazing the first time. Can't recommend enough.
love this game
I love this game. I've played it ever since I was a kid! Now it's on steam and even better cause MODS :D
HD remake of the greatest RTS ever. This makes me beyond happy.
"I love this game, it brings me good memories Recommended!"
this game came out when i was 4. i still play it.
Same game as before only easier to play with friends now
If you are a fan of the original this is a must buy!
"The good old times. If you're feelling nostalgic, this is the game for you."
Really awesome game
"very good game, a classic stradegy game, good to play with friends"
"Grew up with this game, still my fav game"
"this is a lad game, Greece world cup 2014"
"it was my first multyplay game, i loved it i got into it. i couldnt avoid the title with the chance of being able to play it again in multiplay ..!   they have done great work also with the new campaigns and its good idea to get it any sale"
Classic.
One of my favorite games ever. Nothing better then watching a group of War Elephants destroy a city
A old classic never dies
5/5
get the suicide people and go jihad mode  when you are finished with blowing up their city then kill everysingle worker because they insulted you  and make sure they dont even have a wall at the end  that will be fun and you will waste 5 days on it
gives me 3 1/2 boners at once
"I got this game as a gift from a friend, and was mildly worried after years of Civ and - damn, over a decade having passed since it came out - that it wouldn't have aged well. I couldn't have been more wrong. The pseudo 3D has been polished, the sounds are crisper, the AI is better, the expansions are neatly bundled in (and let's not get started on the Forgotten DLC!) and it's everything you want out of an HD remake.  Literally a game that came out better than your nostalgia filter remembers it. Tons of fun."
Child hood relived! 10/10
Legacy Bundle on Summer Sale :)
"This is the game that inspired me to study Archaeology, and it is the best decision i have ever made, no regrets. This game is just as good as I remember it a millenia ago, the complete package means you can play whatever civilisation you want against any civilisation you want, I love it. Totally recommend as a casual but addictive game."
Very addicting 
Very fun and many different playstyles. A true RTS.
Fun game! Play it with your friends.
not even gonna say anything. its age of empires. just get the damn thing
"Certainly without a doubt of the best and certainly the greatest classic RTS game out there! :D This, a long with the other games in the Age of Empires series, just takes hours from my days away! EVERYONE GET THIS GAME!! :D"
"My God, don't buy this game, it's so buggy, get the original instead and download the Forgotten empires mod., it does all the same and more."
"If you dont buy this game, you're a peice of ♥♥♥♥. So ask yourself 'Can I really go on living knowing that Im a complete POS?'"
Childhood memories :D  Probably the best AoE
"Simply one of the best RTS ever created, Must have !!"
Only ever train archers
Lot's of fun. Very nostalgic. It's great to see this game get HD graphics.
It's AoEII but in glorious HD. You should buy it.
"I loved this game back in the day, but as computers advanced the graphic drivers began to distort the pixels of things to odd colors. Now its back and aside from the buggy campaign, just as good as before!"
"Amazing game, the expansion is great too.   Only con I can think of is the servers were pretty rubbish when the game first came out, but they are pretty set now"
Lovely game :)
The ♥♥♥♥
Good fun game if your by your self even better with friends
"A classic, I was so excited to see this reach the steam marketplace so that I could relive its glory once again! This is the greatest RTS of all time."
"This is a really fun game. But for me it's a little hard to navigate around the map. Other then that, it's a very fun game, and I would highly recommend it."
"Played it since the beginning, even better. Also better with mods."
"This is the ultimate classic RTS, one that has resiliently stood the test of time. It's amazing that a game from 1999 can still be this relevant in the gaming community 15 years later. I've put more hours into Age of Empires II than any other, and it was worth every second. Pick it up if you can."
Extremely fun and addictive game. The HD graphics make it even more fun to play. 10/10
One of the best games of my childhood and still one of the best RTSs to date IMHO.
It's really fun if you enjoy RTS.
Get this game it is a classic
"At Thanksgiving during cleanup I snuck into the pantry where the trash was so I could scare whoever opened the door next. I totally expected it to be my wife's aunt or mother-in-law. As the door slowly opened I let out a low but powerful growl starting off low volume into a yelling growl. Well, her 80 year old grandma almost fell down and then she grabbed her chest. Fortunately she was physically fine, meaning no hospital visit required. Unfortunately she needed a change of clothes. After much embarrassment for both, although I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥less, her and my wife's grandpa end up leaving. On the way out of the driveway she's waiving to everyone and I'm last in line. When she gets to me she doesn't wave but instead turns her hand into a gun and starts air shooting me as they back out of the driveway."
Who doesn't like Age of Empires!?!?! One of the best games ever made. Really takes you back to the good ol' 90s.
"Beautiful, what they have done to a classic game. Love the Graphical improvements, and classic gameplay.  Will spend many many hours on this game!"
"Very cool, brings back so many memories playing this years ago!"
"A beloved childhood classic of mine, if you loved it when it came out i recommend it the few things they added i genuenly enjoy about it but still manages to stick mostly to the classic AoE2 if you've never played AoE i'd reccomend it be this one."
"this is only one of the BEST rts games of all time. i grew up playing AOE II, and when i found out that they were making the HD version for Steam (shortly after i got an account), i was overjoyed. i'm so glad that this game has been given a new lease on life (even though it probably wasn't going anywhere anyway!)"
"A classic game, beautifully done. I owned the CD of the original AoK edition, and with the Conquerors and the Forgotten expansions, the game becomes so much more.  I noticed the AI is a bit more buggy for me however, but Im sure that can be easily remedied."
"Cult classic from 1999. Still fun, refreshing, active community and modding, great at LAN parties. Tried other RTS games, they failed as they were thrown to the ground. Wololo!"
I love this game! Its one of the very first games I ever played on pc and its great that steam has a new and improved version.
The game is a bit outdated but hey it's a remake of Age of Empires 2 which is awesome. I to be honest would prefer that they were spending there funding on creating a new game rather than improving one that doesn't need to be. They didn't even improve the graphics though.
A nicer looking version of one of the best RTS games out there. Super fun time killer. 10/10
Why are you even bothering reading the reviews - JUST GET THE GAME!!!!!!
"This game, is of a coupple of years ago, but I still like it, I don't know why, but I love that kind of games xD. So, it's a very good game.  Este juego, es de hace unos años, pero me sigue gustando, no sé porqué, pero me encantan este tipo de juegos xD Así qué, es un muy buen juego."
"Almost 20 years old, still play.  The remake could be better, though..."
10/10 would win only with monks and have large amounts of lag again   pls fix the lag
"Playing older computer games on newer systems can be a challenge. But Age of Empires II HD does it perfectly. The game runs smoothly, the textures are crisp, and it runs in full widescreen. Thanks to the developers for bringing my first computer game into the modern era!"
"I'm a big fan of Age of Empires and have been faithful for several years. Such a shame that the original company Ensemble Studios folded in 2009. This is probably the best of the series. Age of Empires 1 was a little too slow for my liking and there no learning curve for the game. You were expected to know everything before you played. And Age of Empires 3 just lacked the spark that this game had. And now we have a HD remake, things just get better and better. New DLC that we haven't seen before and all the bad things that were in the original are now gone. PLUS multiplayer!! One thing I will say against it though is this game is very unforgiving for new players. It's MUCH more difficult than the original so personally I would reccomend Age of Empires 3 to start if you want to stay in the franchise. I really couldn't reccomend any other game to you because this and Starcraft are the kings or RTS. If you're looking for a fast paced action packed fun game that does have some learning needed then this is the game for you. 9.5/10 - Whilst this is a much beter version than the original it has lost a little of the magic of the original. That being said this fixes all the stuff wrong with the original but changes a few things. Like the UI is different from the original and just a few things here and there. With that being said, it's a wonderful RTS that is perfect for anyone looking for something to replace Starcraft 2 for a while."
"As much as I love it, I can't recommend a game this old at the current price."
"One of the Best RTS' ever made, age of empires is a classic!"
HD could have been done better but its still good.
"Fun,more fun and even more. Great hd remake 10/10. This game will live for the years to come a great stratedy game for all &lt;EVEN YOU&gt;"
.
"You know you want and you know you need this ...  One of the best Multiplayer Strategy Games ever, constant flashback feelings whil playing and teaching you some nice history! What could you want more of a game?"
"Just like the original, but in HD!"
love this game
"This is as great as I remembered! I've spent all my teens playing Age of Empires games, and to be able to play it once again is just great. Really excited to play also 'The Forgotten'."
Best RTS ever! Would buy again.
"This is the same AoE II that you are used to, except with improvments to make it still enjoyable HD. Love how the have added little improvments that make a big difference while keeping the game the same."
no yes  no yes no yes Awesome game lag has gotten alot better in multiplayer
"An old classic , very fun with lots of factions and great gameplay. Fighting, diplomacy and trading all combined into one great strategy game."
"I really ♥♥♥♥ing hate this... Wololololololololololololo   Ok lets start off, this is one of the best RTS games ever i've played this as a child and still do. No matter that the graphics are a little dated however if opinion are fully based on graphics then good then I'd recommend C&amp;C 3 or planetary annihilation due to both being also awesome and look great aswell.   Lets start off this was in an age where instead of everyone being balanced everyone has that op factor yet they arn't broken. We start off as the little weak village and build up to the ♥♥♥ kicking empire that you wanna be. You either build up with allies or destroy everon.  It has tons of content and was in the age when you buy a game for £40/$60 you got more than 40+ hours of game time and it actully worked on install. The game even has a tutorial campaign to help you play!  I recommend this for anyone and rate it a 10/10"
"A classic timesink of my childhood, and a great RTS with plenty of relatively well balanced options for different play styles. I highly recommend it."
"A flat out amazing RTS game. I played it for years before purchasing the HD version from steam and it was well worth it. While it has its multiplayer issues, it is a fantastic game with lots of content and replayability."
"I would recommend this game if you can get if for a good price. I don't like it that much over the original. Though the AI is better and you get some campaign missions. I didn't like the texture. I expected the texture to be a lot better than what it is now. I get lag when the pop. limit is set to 500. I always play with a pop. limit of 500. I don't know if there is lag at lower limits. The hardware in my gaming rig isn't the issue here. There seems to be some software issue that causes this problem.   After playing for 39 hours I think its worth buying if the price is good, but don't expect too much from this game."
Best RTS of all time.
That game I played when I was young is now on steam. Yay.
Any fan of Age of Empires needs this... just to be able to play this game online with friends is a blast from the past.
An old classic now in HD. I was waiting for this so long. The old game did have some color problems as the computers did evolve by the time. That ain't problem anymore and it works like a charm. I did enjoy the battles back then and i still adore them today at lan parties with friends gathered.
Best classic RTS game &lt;3
A recreation of the EPIC AoE2. made bigger and meaner with expansion and pop cap increase. get a good 30+ hours back on it
"Loving it! After all the patches, finally works great."
IN DEED a classic must have for any AOE FAN !!!! thanks steam for AOE i do recommend this game!!!!
one of the best games. and the best AoE in the series.
"I'm happy to say that this game has aged terrifically. It's been years since I had played, and while I had to relearn things, I'm loving playing it again, now with the full HD support."
The all-time classics is now revamped and no longer broken.  I had great fun with my friends accompanied with the lord of the rings soundtrack available from the steam community workshop.  10/10
"Very Fun RTS, they converted it to HD very well. Just as fun as it was 10 years ago if not moreso."
START THE GAME ALREADY!
"I grew up with this game. I've logged more hours into this game than I can remember. And now that it's arrived on Steam, in HD and with additional content, you better believe I bought it all over again! The flow of gameplay is unlike any I've experienced since. Micromanaging a civilization and juggling visceral, dynamic combat have never felt so rewarding. You feel the weight of every choice you make, and it feels so satisfying to see your accomplishments at the end of the day. Best of all, there's no set way to play; no expected sequence of events or tasks for you to follow. The rate of growth, the methods, and manner of warfare are entirely up to you. There is no shortage of variety or method for you to emplore. No two scenarios will feel the same. If combat isn't your thing, and you'd rather just build you own empire and watch it thrive, then the game is only too eager to accommodate you. With a killer soundtrack to boot, it's hard not to come back to Age of Empires 2 over and over again."
"Very good on making your own maps, without buildings and making realistic strategies."
"pretty fun, worth buying if you wanna kill some time!"
Leave now or this game will suck you in.
"Absolutely wonderful game! This was one of the first strategy games I played as a kid, and is still easily one of my favorite games! If you enjoy strategy, battles, and world building, this is a must-have for your game collection!"
"So this is a hard one for me. Basically, I feel like I'm writing this review about the original game, Age of Empires II, which is (still) freaking awesome and fun to play, especially with friends. The difficulty can be set low for beginners or very hard for absolute experts, in case they like facing challenges. Building up your own medieval territory has never been as fun. You have to choose a society to play with, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses. Then you fight each other. That's about it.  Now of course the original is old and so is its engine. What I expected from this HD-Remake was to improve the visuals of the game, make it available for online play again, cutting out bugs and redoing some parts of the HUD. But all this game does, is offer you the option of playing it with a higher resolution (something that in my opinion could have been done way more efficiently by releasing a patch for the original). While this is exactly what it promisses, I still wouldn't pay the full price for a game, that was basically published twice. Instead, wait for it to be on sale and enjoy massive battles with your mates.  "
this is ace
"It works, and its AOE what more do you need to know, classic game with HD graphics and plenty of hours working your way through the ages dominating your foes with a barrage of siege weapon fire :)"
"Ah, Good Old age of empires. I played the original version of this game for many hours when I was younger. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible in this review.  First, a word to any veterans that may be considering the HD version: KEYBINDS. If you had all the old ones memorised, you are going to have to rebind them. They don't use the original keybindings in this version.   Now, for those that have not played before... A brief overview of what is possible. -Random matches are basically an 'anything goes' type of round. There are multiple ways to win, Not just by combat.  -Deathmatches start you with high resources and are a battle to the death.  -Regicide (a personal favorite) is a game variant in which you must protect your king while hunting down the enemy kings.  -Wonder race is quite simply, the first person who is able to build a wonder. If you were 'wondering' what a wonder is, that basically is a monument made by your race. It can also be used to win a random match, however you must defend it for a length of time for it to work in that game mode.  -King of the hill (I believe is what it is called) is a variant in which you must protect a neutral wonder in the middle of the map for x amount of time. -Capture the relic is a single relic on the map which must be captured to win. Both king of the hill and capture the relic can be VERY fast paced matches depending on your opponent.  Now, something for both vets and newbies alike:  -Treaties! - if you struggle fighting 'rush' tactics in rts games, the DLC for this allows for you to set a time limit in which everyone is friendly. This prevents people from rushing you and gives newer players a chance to see how others play. -Increased population limits! The old version had a limit of 200. The max now is 500 and there are even some forge mods that allow you to go even higher (although I wouldn't recommend it for your own sanity)  Now, I thought this was going to be great... I was wrong... -New map size!... I thought this was going to be AWESOME at first. I was horribly dissapointed when I saw the tremendous amount of lagg this causes during multiplayer rounds. Stick to giant and you are fine. LUDAKRIS is 4 times larger than giant, and for some reason it laggs like a MOFO. It gets even worse if you add an AI to the map.   Now, My final verdict..  Overall gameplay - 8 / 10. The reason I don't give it a 10 is due to the fact that I'm not that big on the campaign. I could live, eat, sleep, and breath the multiplayer but I find the campaign boring at best.  Community - 7 / 10. For the most part you run across fairly nice people. Of course, every game has a few rotten apples playing it.  Diversity 9 / 10. Unlike some games where you see 'cookie cutter' builds and races, Pretty much anything is viable on here. There are a few things that could use some rebalancing but, if you have a brain you can still counter most of them.  AI (Computer Players) 10 / 10. You want a challenge? put those suckers on max difficulty. You'll be running home to your grandmother crying by the feudal age.  Nostalgia 11 / 10. Nuff Said. "
"Age of Empires II in my opinion is a lot better than Age of Empires III, the classical element to the game fuels my nostalgia drive. Plus it is frickin' awesome and a good challenge at points."
Buy this game and play it with me for i am lonley and nostalgic.
"Ah, Age of Empires... my childhood. Soo many good memories lie with this game, and now that it's rereleased in HD AND was on sale, well, heheh...   So anyway, I decided to play this again not just for old time's sake, but because I also know that I will be able to actually play a proper game rather than just mindlessly play around the Scenario Editor (Nope, still losing. Those two wins I had were just flukes xD)  So why get this game? First, this game is based on history. I mean, who doesn't like history? Sure, it's bloody as hell, but it also spawned thousands of stories about heroism, treachery, chivalry, corruption, among other things. The campaign modes of this game touches those as we revisit stories of selected heroes that shaped their respective countries.   Second, this game will decide whether you are leader material or not. Are you strong enough to lead an army? A town? A nation? An Empire? This game can tell you. Play singleplayer with an AI or battle with your friends with the mutiplayer feature.  Third, the Scenario Editor. A lot of RTS have this, and nothing really out of ordinary with this one too. It's just enjoyable as hell to play around with. And with the new Steam Workshop integration, you can share your magnificent creations as well as try other people's.  And Lastly, this game is HD. Now I'm not sure if there was any difference with the units or structures, but the entire game has been modified to play well in the newer computers, even the ones with Widescreens on them. No more getting stuck in 1024x768 resolution or graphics breaking. Play the game and relive your childhood!   Alright then, here's a TL;DR for y'all lazy dudes:  PROS:"
This game is so much fun! I loved playing this game as a kid and it's so awesome to see it back again and with people playing. So much fun.
Ah the nostalgia
"15 years ago, i loved this game. Today, I'm still loving it! AOE HD edition delivers!"
A classic that's still fun and rich as any RTS today! updated with new civilizations! Gimme!   I hope they bring Rise of Rome to steam as well.
An old game from my Childhood redone so it can be used on modern machines!  9/10  Nostalgic rating :P
I absolutely love this game!!!
Now includes everything you wish the original version included. Like a population limit of 500 per civ. bigger maps... Worth buying again!
"Fun but hard, great time waster, multiplayer and online. Look up some guides to get sorted."
"I was pleasently surprised with this game. i looked at gameplay and thought that it looked stupid but i was wrong, me and my friends play muliplayer and it works great, there is no lag and is totally worth the money!"
"Upon reflection, AOE II was possibly the zenith of classic RTS games and still stands as one of the greatest RTS' ever made. The HD version, with graphical and other improvements makes only slight changes that manage to enhance an already perfect game. You will find hundreds of hours of enjoyment here."
Just like it used to be; but better. Some nice community downloads to make it look superb!
Great game.
the game is really well done and redesigne
In this version of Age of Empires 2 they made the PC much better and now there is a lot of people playing online. Population limit is 500 and they also added more maps. Huge improvements from the original AOE2. I recommend this game to anyone. Play with friend and you will have tons of fun. Steam should also make a new HD version of the Star Wars game that is just like AOE2 (Starwars Galactic Battle Grounds). Thank you Steam keep up the good work.
"All right, this game is basicly the old AoE so dont purchase if you already own the game, but if you don't or you need the steam multiplayer to play with freinds then its a goods purchase"
"The classic is back and better than ever! I have the Collector's edition but it has issues on newer systems (frequent crashes, etc) so i was ecstatic to see that it had been updated to run on those new systems. This game is the only reason I finally got Steam I couldn't wait to try it out. I haven't played it a lot lately due to moving and such, but still find it fun."
"Good gameplay, rewarding experience. They really thought out all the civilizations and mechanics to make an amazing RTS. My only complaint is that multiplayer can be a bit laggy."
watched my workers die farming while being pelted by spears  never again
"I got this game due to influence from my friend and I cant say that i have regretted it. Have spent some very good hours trying to hold back friend's attack, trying to figure his strategy and such. Hey, I have played it through a whole night before getting too tired to continue and that alone says something."
What can I say... It's Age of Empires... A classic. Everything like the old version. Still love to play this game.
"One of my all time top 5 RTS games out there and took me down memory lane. The HD Edition adds some new stuff to an already polished game, wish more RTS games followed in its footsteps. 10/10 would recommend, just grab some friends and LAN up!"
"So much funsies, eating all of my times. Om nom."
A fantastic game that has well and truly stood the test of time. A must have for any gamer.
Get this game right now
"Classic game, best RTS of its time if not, all-time."
"This game has long sense been a member of my seemingly endlessly growing library of games, and by far, it is one of the few games that I can go back to year after year and still get the exact same level of fun that I did back when I first started playing it.  I honestly really love it when companies do reboots of these kinds of games. As the biggest challenge in PC gaming is when your game is not compatible with the current operating systems. Yet, this game runs smoothly, and I have personally encountered no glitches with the base game. As always, some mods may or may not contain glitches, and it would be impossible to review them all.  If you like RTS set in a midevil setting with a beautifully crafted set of campaigns, I would strongly reccomend this game. It has a good balance between length of missions, as they are not to long or to short due to resources eventually being depeleted. So you can turtle if you like, but not indefinately.   The map making tools are really easy to learn and use, and anyone can set up their own basic skirmishes or even make their own campaigns if they want to sit down and craft them out.  Overall, 10/10 hands down."
This is the best RTS game since 1999.
AoE 2 is a classic that deserves a spot in every gamer's library. Get it when you can!
really cool game
Great game to play with friends and have large footmen wars. Highly recommended for one of the best RTS games I have played! :D
"Legionaires bugged up for me, now only got Jaguar warriors.  Cant fix this isue no matter what I have done... aside from that awsome game."
golden oldie   i've played this game for days when i was young now i and reliving those days  this is an absolute classic
"THe classic AoE I grew up with, I learned so much from the actual historical facts between each round of the game."
much fun. such play. very hd. wow
"The new HD solves all the problems while trying to play whit friends in multiplayer, also a very complete Forgotten DLC and many Workshop cool items!"
Very enjoyable if you throw in a couple of mods that spice up the otherwise lacklustre graphics.
The best aoe game
"One of the best, if not the best rts game of all time!"
The legendary classic... every bit as good as it's ever been. Slightly dated in some ways but still a fantastic game that holds up.
"Loved this game, I used to play this with 3 of my friends back in 7th grade in computer class. We played this all the time till we had to start class but man I missed this so much. But now I have now on steam its like i was gifted to power of AOE once again."
It's a must have in your Steam Library. It's a classic!
very good fun
"An HD remake of literally the greatest RTS game ever made that's playable online with all of your Steam friends? YES PLEASE. There's really no legitimate reason to say no to this game, it's got everything you want from an RTS game now with 100 bonus points of nostolgia! The factions are different and refreshing, the gameplay is solid, and the AI is brutal. My only issue is that the computer players are all wussies and never let you actually destroy them. They see a large army headed their way and forfeit, so the victory isn't as sweet. If anyone knows a mod to fix that, please let me know =)"
Great game. Brings me back to the good ol' days highly recommended.
"The best RTS i have ever played, remastered. Its basically just the original revamped so it will work on newer PCs but its certainly worth 20 bucks!"
one of the best rts games out there.
It's amazing that I skipped this game back when it first came out. I purchased it here on Steam and I'm am amazed at how good this game really is. It's one of the best RTS games I've ever played and even though it's older it is a solid excellent RTS. I highly recommend it to those that love RTS games as there aren't enough out there and this one is a great game that will take you quite some time to complete all the campaigns. I am a huge campaign player as I don't play online so I don't know much about this game's multiplayer aspects. This is a MUST HAVE for those that never played it or for those that just want to take a walk down memory lane. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
"An old classic that never gets old. The campaigns have battles, challenges and story as characters and history are brought to life through the rich dialogue narration. Custom battles can range from easy to mildly challenging. Multi-player ranges from extremely hard to hellish. Game play is easy to catch on and combines fluidly with strategy to make hundreds of thousands of ways to bring your adversaries down."
Well what can i say! i have played this game way back when! and played it today i still love it its just one of thoes games for me that brings me back to the start of all the pc gameing for me.
"If you don't have this game already, see a trained medical professional. Something may be wrong with you. In the event that something is NOT wrong with you, just buy the game and join the timeless club of Champions. Go ahead, be a champion."
"This is a gem from my childhood, and when I saw that it was on steam I had to buy it without thinking twice.  AoE 2 is still the amazing RTS that I remember from when I was a kid, the gameplay is solid, the bots are brutal and there is pretty much always something to learn  10/10 would advance to Imperial again"
Everyone get this game. Do it. Do it now and don't even blink.
I love this revive of the classic game. Can't get enough of it!
GREAT remake of a GREAT game!
This game just doesn't get old. Played the original back when it was first released back in 2000 and I'm still playing it now!
"Actually one of my favorite games, I played it as a kid when I was younger and then lost my disk for it. As soon as I saw it on steam though I purchased it right away and now I have over 227 hours of playing it.. So addictive!"
"One of the best RTS games of all time, the graphics have aged considerably well, the music is awesome, the gameplay is a little bit slower compared to AoE 3, but still great.  Score 7/10"
"This is a good game with a good mixture of economics and military, but i can't get into Age of Empires 2 The Conquerors anymore. Anyone know why?"
sick classic game filled with tons of achievements! Wicked HD remake!
A good game especially if you love strategic games like civ 5.
AoE speaks for itself if your looking for a review of this game all you need to know is that the thing you were missing in your life of video gaming then look no further this is that missing thing get it and love it and be it AoE 2 is possibly the best game out there only ever beaten by its daddy AoE 1 but you can't get that then get this one and be in awe at its awesomeness
"This game is one for the ages. Ever since it came out it has been a constant source of fun, and now even more fun working in HD and with new campaigns. What more can you ask for? 5/5 game."
"It's a classic, and really good to play with friends, haven't played the entire campaign, but it's really good too in case you're not into playing with friends"
"Countless hours of fun for a game that is a bit dated, does an awesome job at captivating whomever plays it."
Epic fun and cool game I love playing it ! Worth every cent!
"(It may say I have like 3 hours on record here, but that's because I used to play this long before Steam even existed. Realistically, it should probably be like 1000 hours.)  It's one of the best RTS's of all time. At long last upgraded to HD and brought to Steam and full proper functionality. The fact that there's a new expansion DLC for it after 10 years is pretty fantastic too."
"A fantastic game for its age, highly recommended! (And nostalgia up to your ears if you played it when younger)"
"No h8, I r8 8 on 8 m8s because this game is gr8"
"Great for Nostalgia, stands up well against modern titles!"
still the best.
"there is many reasons to buy this game... play the same masterpiece on the new servers, challange the new AI wich is ALOT more intelligent, maybe try some community-made maps/scenarios. but don't count on the HD part."
"I played this game so much as a kid. When it wouldnt run properly on windows XP/7 properly anymore, I was heartbroken. This HD remake fixed my heart again :P. Other than a few multiplayer lag issues, this game runs flawlessly.  That being said, you cannot call yourself a true RTS player and not have played this game.   10/10"
"Like you don't know this, but this game is awesome!"
my first and favorite rts ever
"I'm really glad someone brought this classic back to life. I had so many hours of fun with it back in the day. Should you have played the original and would still like to get a taste of it once again, you'll be happy to know that they almost entirely left the game as it was back in the day, only this time with mod support, support for modern machines, and Steamworks integration for multiplayer! Even to this day this classic holds its own and I think you will find a lot of enjoyment out of it even now."
Great game.
"Way back when this game as well as 'Empire Earth' were what got me interested in RTS to begin with.. and still today this game is amazing, Weither if for nastalga or you are dicovering it for the first time, this game is one of the best RTS on the market, and has been for years 9.5/10 "
Countless hours spent on this game in the past and I still love it today!
It's excellent the 2nd time around. Holds up well and doesn't try to excuse itself from the core elements of an RTS like its more modern counterparts.
I ♥♥♥♥ing hate villages.

This game is so much fun! I loved playing this game as a kid and it's so awesome to see it back again and with people playing. So much fun.
Ah the nostalgia
Nestalgia will get this game a lot of good reviews but in reality it deserves it's reputation as an RTS that has aged spectacularly well.
A true RTS classic!
"The best part is being able to play matched with some frieds, whether it's against each other or teamed up against bots you are always infor a good time. I love this game and whether you choose to play solo and go through campaigns, or play multiplayer you are in for hours of challenging strategy filled fun! My firends and I have been having AoE parties for years, and probably will for years to come."
HECK YEA AWESOME STRATEGIES
"I personally liked this one better than the III because I felt it was more and fun as a strategy game. I feel the number III just has better graphics and more variety. Now with this made HD We can finally get that classic , retro feeling without worrying about graphics. Truly great . Im a fan of the series and I awaited this for long . It was worth every penny. 8/10"
Played this game as a kid and it has always been an alltime favorite!
"(10/10) Yea I like it, just as much as i did back in the old days. The new 'expansion' plus Workshop just makes it even greater!"
Not as cool as Civ. But still good
It's the same exact game at a higher resolution. If that's what you want then that's what you get. I for one still dig it.
...
"Love this game, the reboot is amazing. Teaches an old dog some new trickss"
"A classic, great game, but a complete technical failure. If your re-release of a 15 year old game drops to 5 fps on a modern gaming pc, you have failed. Works okay on land maps but completely unplayable on water maps with all graphically options down. Not worth your money."
One of the best RTS games ever made.
Warning: This game is incredibly addictive and is more fun than any game you own ;)
worked for a wile now game wont open 
its age of empires with higher pop cap what more do you want 
"I loved this game when I was a kid. Actually I hated it, because I was addicted to it.  Still good for wasting time, all these years later."
What the hell are you waiting for? Buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game you piece of ♥♥♥♥.
"I've loved this since childhood and i still like it now! even though the competitve scene is far harder then i was expecting, by far my most favourite game in my library. :)"
Fantastic game. It is just like the old days and maybe even better.
i love these games  
"I've been addicted to this game since forever. This RTS is simply classic, it's hard to get sick of it. It's not complex in any major way what so ever. It's basic and works the way any classic RTS should. Even if you're not a hardcore RTS fan, and want a relaxing one to play casually, it's a great choice. Competitive players also enjoy this game, partly for it's balance."
I've played this game too much
"Despite its age, this game holds up really well, and with 4 or more players in a match, things can get pretty hectic! would definitely recommend either for nostalgia value, or if you're a fan of the RTS genre."
"Nothing new, but as good as the original."
As soon as I launched the game memories from over 10 years ago came rushing back. I loved this game and still love it. Thank you for bringing it back.
"Other than the weird multiplayer lag I still have not been able to fix, this game is awesome, and totally worth buying."
"Just as awesome as I remember it, still the best strategy game I have ever played, nice to have the updated resolution and graphics, and the new campaigns are just as fun as the old, aside from the missing voice overs."
One of the best RTS games out there. Great to play with friends. 10/10
"Gorgeous recreation of the Game of Kings. The balance of the *multiple* races still lets them feel unique and fun but not overwhelmingly powerful or weak. It's been many, many years since the original was released and it still feels as fun as or more fun than any of the mainstream RTS games. Single player is worth playing and a fun challenge for non-competitive types."
One of my favorite games of all time! Valve maybe made it harder... but its still good   on disc 13/11  on steam meh ok 10/11
"A classic revitalised with a new expansion and relatively crisp HD graphics. Some of the game mechanics show their age and the AI is nothing spectacular, but the nostalgia and great foundation of this game is undeniable."
Good old game. Bring back memories but the controls aren't really that responsive.
"Such a good RTS game, one of the best, I feel. Even though the graphics are a little dated, it's both a lot of fun and a pain to beat :D  9.3/10"
"A remake done right, love this game, my favourite RTS of all time."
Classic! Since AoEO has gone offline I Bought AoE II on Steam and I am really enjoying it.   There are many features from AoEO I miss very much but until the AoE series releases a new title AoE II is where its at folks
"Been playing the original AoE 2 for 8 years, this HD remake is really sweet."
definetly an improvement to old games with res being fixed 
"Nice remake, 20$ for it is too much, but well, you can grab it on sales and play that awesome game with your widescreen monitor and with a working online mode !"
How many ships does the AI want to build? Jesus Christ.
"It is a great remake of the old-school-hit Age of Empires 2 with some features, that made the game even better. As a beginner, you won't see many differences unless you bought the DLC (which i also recommend to fans of AoE) straight away. But as you start playing the game continously and also playing online, you will see that some new features made a lot of new possibiities to own your foes. The DLC 'The Forgotten' includes a few new civilisations and campaigns, so if you played through all campaigns, keep playing the game and are interested in strategy games such as this, i highly recommend it. All in all this game is definetly woth its money."
Took on a Army with 1 soldier and won 10/10
"Best game ever. Must like the original, this version will still lag in multiplayer with large amounts of units and activity"
best old strategic game
"this game is kinda fun actually , the bots are not dumb and whatnot , the only matter is that most of the players are german which makes me really hard to play online since i live in asia , nice remake overall"
"AOEII HD is a really fun game. They did a great job updating it so that it can be played on modern computers. AOEII would not play on my Windows 8.1 desktop. This HD version from steam works great and looks great. Be careful when playing this game, it can be addictive."
"This game is all of my nostalgia. Text books be damned, this is where I learned everything I know about history.  This is one of my top 10 games of all time, for sure, but I'm so rusty at it that Salad Fingers likes to play with my nipples. Deffinately worth getting (again) thanks to updated graphics, new soundtrack additions, and Steam workshop compadability!"
What else is there to say about this game? Its a CLASSIC. Can't get enough of this one
Some games should remain happy memories. 15 years ago I loved it to bits but now it's a frustratingly dated experience. RTS has moved on as genre and no amount of 'definition' can bring AoE II up to snuff in 2014.
age of empires ftw +1 for warlods battlecry
"It's a classic, BUY IT NOW!"
"I like the difficulty of this game; it has a less casual feel than it used to in the original. I find it harder to win even on the easiest difficulty when playing alone. The graphics weren't really updated too much that I could notice, but it was nice being able to play in an HD aspect ratio. I look forward to spending many hours playing."
"Yes, this isn't the newest RTS out there, but it's still easily one of my favorites. I've always loved the gameplay. One thing I would recommend: look up HD mods for the game. they make the game look truly HD!"
"Classic, still one of my favorite games of all time. I was surprised but not at all dissapointed to hear that about the HD remake!"
Great game with friends.
Awesome game. You should get it.
"This game is ridiculously fun. Bit harder from what I remember, but it's an awesome singleplayer and multiplayer experience."
"Well, let's get this straight. The game is totally awesome... But intense multitasking skillz are required, which i don't have :C That's all i can say"
best way to spend 4 hours...
If you played this in the 90's your going to love it today. Playing and connecting is easy. Drops multiplayer rarely.
they based the AI off of kids from camp CAMP
This game is not HD at all. Well the textures the community offer are HD but the menu's are just stretched to 1080p. Overall great game to play.
I beat an old man to death with an axe 10/10 would play again
'how do you turn this on' -&gt; ctrl+A -&gt; ctrl+C -&gt; (ctrl+v -&gt; enter) x999999999999
This game is way too addicting even playing against the AI system is entertaining.
i barely played 750 hours of Age of empires Hd so far and the multiplayer is finally getting fixed. Hurray.
"This game is an awesome throwback to my childhood, but there is one thing folks should be aware of. Since they added a new expansion the hotkeys are all in the 'grid' set up instead of the old hotkeys so I find myself falling back to muscle memory and building random things as most of the hotkeys are different so that they could add the new units and technologies.   That being said once you get used to the new layout, or change it back to the old one it is a game I will probably end up spending another few hundred hours on as time goes by. Definately recommend."
All the fun you used to have and more :D
THE game.  S-h-i-t-t-y multiplayer though.
The (second) greatest game of all time. Highly recommended.
"WARNING: The game causes severe nostalgic attack with its childhood-memory inducing MIDI music, swords and arrows which set stone walls on fire and of course the wololos. 11."
"Great game except for glitches where you finish a scenario and no new scenario unlocks, you aren't done with the campaign it just doesn't unlock the next step. Also sometimes if you manage to unlock the next scenario you click it only to realize that you're repeating the same mission as before! If this wasn't the case i'd give it 10/10. Glitched scenarios include Attilla the Hun, El Cid, Montezuma, and Genghis Khan. This is a great many of them and came as a disappointment to me."
One of my all time fave PC games! Even better now that they came out with an HD version. Great job on that guys. Extremely fun to play and you learn pretty quickly how to play.
"I first played this game over nine years ago, it still lives up to the expectations. 10/10. Well made, awesome amounts of fun."
"Great game, an absolute classic! this is the game that really got me into the RTS genre, and I almost cried when i heard about 'The Forgotten' expansion. This game taught me pretty much everything I know about history, which in retrospect probably isn't a good thing... They also increased the amount of resources gained through cheating from 1000 to 10000, which is nice because it got to the point where typing 'robin hood' became second nature and i did it faster then others could ctrl+c..."
"this game is legend , all strategy player must play this game"
"If you love RTS games and you haven't played Age of Empires 2 just buy it now, you won't be disappointed. The only thing that might turn new players away from it is the anachronistic historical setting and the sprite-based graphics. Otherwise it is a solid, time tested game with TONS of options. Seriously, there are just a lot of different cultures to play as in this game and the Steam expansion adds even more.  However, Age of Empires veterans won't find much to this version of the game. It runs faithfully on Windows 7 or 8, there's multiplayer over Steam now and the workshop items are great. But I did question some of the changes they made to the interface. The resources used to be sort of color coded and it was easy to tell what you had or what your were trading at a glance. Now the food icon is a golden ear of corn so it kind of looks like the gold icon. ALL of the hotkeys are now completely different for just no reason at all. I'm constantly building the wrong structures because I had a different set of hotkeys for years and years."
Good Old Game
"Remember playing this at a young age on windows 2000, holy ♥♥♥♥ them memories, was young back then so never played online but man it was awsome and always wanted to play this in a resurrected form. never liked any AOE other then this one. its an awesome game for anyone who loved RPG the way it was back then."
I tip m'fedora to this game
"This is an incredible real time strategy game that I grew up with. Ensemble Studios created a true strategy gem with unique aspects, such as monks, relics, and wonders, as well as many accessible, historical campaigns. The multiple factions are well balanced while still allowing for a variety of playstyles, from economic and defensive to aggressive. My personal favorite parts of this game are the historical campaigns and the in game database. Both give some insight into the age after the fall of the western Roman Empire starting around 500CE. There are also plenty of non-historical match ups that can be made, such as Spanish Conquistadors fighting Persian war elephants. Additionally, there is an incredible editor that is easy to use to make your own scenarios. All of this was available in the original version of this game, but what the HD edition offers is renewed internet accessibility via the Steam network, improved visuals (I no longer need to kill explorer to run the game), and Steam workshop integration for modding and scenario sharing. Alltogether, it is the strategy game all your friends can play and now you don't need to share a CD at a LAN party."
"AOE is a great game to play and be entertained, I've been playing this for 12 years already, you will always find rooms to play, with a bunch of different styles, what I don't like about this game, actually about the game on Steam is that the ELO rating is really non-sense, you can win a 1x1 and get 12 points then you want to play with people you might think are from your level, then you're screwed because your elo was upgraded and now you get kicked out on every single game, but professional level....if there is one. Besides that, I definitely recommend the game (English is not my native language, apologies for my grammar)"
Age of Empires II HD is fun to play either alone or with friends. Its a great game that isn't over too quick as it takes a while to build rescources and raise an army.
"Great, really gives AOEII the fame it deserves. Also that nostalgia."
"There is nothing more satisfying then playing a random map with your friends, gathering resources, and then absolutely annihilating each other in all-out warfare. Or you can play it safe, build up your defences, construct a wonder and hope no on comes to stop you. A great HD re-make that runs brilliantly, and has a great campaign too. Age of Empires always delivers on great RTS gameplay."
"This game is a classic in every sense of the word. I am elated that Microsoft dusted this game off, gave it a new coat of paint and integrated it into Steam. I hope this game is always available to play on modern PC's because there hasn't been anything like it in the RTS space since."
Big recommand easy to play multiplayer 500 population cap
Love this game! Multiplayer is much easier than in the original!
This game is as good as it was 15 years ago.
"Standard, classic RTS. What more is there to say? It plays great on a modern platform."
"This game is awesome because you can play as great historical figures, and then run your enemies over with sports cars.  Also, it's a classic."
Still the best!  I had to laugh a little when the HD version got my attention. The community has been able to achieve high resolutions for years now via patches. Either way still worth the money.
"I bought this a couple months ago and have NOT regretted it. I was always a huge AOE fan, particularly of II, and having it handily accessible on Steam would be a compelling argument to buy it, but the additional content and updated graphics make it a must have."
AOE II HD is wonderful but Steam is controlling and abusive.
"I bought these type of games when they where in school which where based off real or close to real life events, if your child likes games and History i would very recommend this game to your child I bought this game 2 times before Steam had this and bought it from Steam when they had the HD version"
This game brings back a lot of college memories! If you enjoy RTS this game is a must have!
"I guess you really can teach old dogs new tricks. This game is still as fun as it ever was, and the visual facelift is a nice bonus. Also, it's got a page in the Steam Workshop, so make sure to dig into all the fun mods!"
"The game that make me a Gamer, the one I will always defend no matter what others say, always will have a place in my heart and in my library"
+1
"One of the best RTS games ever, exactly the same as in 1999."
strategy classic 7.5/10
GET IT
"Ah... an old classic from back in the day. Fight legions of soldiers against each other, or dominate the world with a wonder. If you are an intrepid explorer, maybe you could even find all the ancient relics and achieve victory that way? However you choose to play... 'That's a nice town, I'll take it.'"
Great fun............. Loved every hour.......
gg too much game sweat
Can Wololo. 11/10
How have you not already played this?
"It was one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever made, and still is. The updated version adds very little (unless you get the Forgotten DLC), but in the end of the day it is the same game you know and love, and it aged really well too. The best part is that it runs on pretty much any system with no tweaking necessary. If you haven't played an RTS before, this is also a great game to start off with; beginners and veterans will enjoy it alike. AoE 2 is fun to play alone, and especially with friends. Overall, I think this game is definitely worth a buy."
A really nice back to the basics. This AOE is awesome in multiplayer !!
Its Just Amazing I Have No Words
"it's age of empires ii but with graphics fixes and workshop mods, you know what you're getting."
"I loved this game when it first came out...I could be found saying 'wololo' at my cat tring to get it to come to me, or at my parents trying to get them to let me play for just a couple min more...but alas, my skills were no match for them. So i changed my shirt to their color and everything worked out for the better.  10/10 Great Memories and Great fun."
"Played it as a kid, its the same game."
10/10 woukld revir again
"Its a great game, watch some videos if you dont know how to play it, I have a mate that learned me the game so i was lucky. If was so worth buying it."
"When I was a lil' folk, I was intrigued by this game like love at first glance. Mainly because this was my first RTS, I liked many things, the historical background, the battles, the need to gain resources, the castles, everything. I dunno man, I also liked the view, it was like watching a mini world growing (like a god) (damn I also liked thomas the train 'cuz of the miniature world for the same reason).  With time I knew other and more diverse RTS, like Imperium, Command and Conquer, Starcraft, etc. But I share a special feeling to the wololo series. Sid meier's games might have been revolutionary at their time, but AoE, was for many the approach into RTS, and it made standards for the marquet.  Simple, yet complicated. I bought the DLC, just beauce of Dracula, but I really would not recommend it, it's not the big thing, and it has an special multiplayer (which mostly is inhabited by AoE pros).  Sadly, the multiplayer suffers from lag problems most of the time. Anyway though I always loved RTS games, I always sucked at them, I have never won a multiplayer match, I still love the game."
I highly enjoyed it before it's resurface to HD. It is still really enjoyable.
"Don't know why people are whining about it being the same game, when it clearly just says it has been improved with HD graphics and better multiplayer, which it does fine. The game itself is even better than the original because you get 500 population limit, and better graphics/resolution."
It need strategy
Love this game
Best strategic classic. Refreshed but didn'd lose a thing from AoE II
Great game but a lazy HD port and its starting to show its age
Classic! - now with decent miltiplayer support.
Classic title that plays even better now. Playing with a group of friends is highly encouraged.
One of the best RTS games of all time. Nothing else to say.
A great remake of a classic game. Brings back memories...
Bad graphics  0/10
CHOP WOOD EVERYDAY!
I really liked it for the fact that u get to stomp your friends into the ground and it takes strats if u are no into RTS games then go play COD 9/10 if only they had the old games.
"If you like medieval strategy games in realtime - then this a must if you want it in Old school. Of all strategy games i been playing, AoE II is absolutely the mother of them all! this is the best of the best! - 100/100 well deserved!"
Your favorite convert unmanned catapults in to christianity simulator.
"This game was my childhood, I spent countless hours on this. One of the best real time strategies to date."
"LOVE THE GAME, I HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS. I HAD IT SINCE THE FIRST AOE, MY SON LOVES IT ALSO PLAYS IT TILL THIS DAY. WE ARE FANS FOR LIFE!!!!!!"
An amazing classic. What else can I say. Just buy it.
Build Civilization. Gets Destroyed. 2+ hours Gone. Repeat.
Pretty awesome farming simulator
Great game.
"Way back when this game as well as 'Empire Earth' were what got me interested in RTS to begin with.. and still today this game is amazing, Weither if for nastalga or you are dicovering it for the first time, this game is one of the best RTS on the market, and has been for years 9.5/10 "
Countless hours spent on this game in the past and I still love it today!
A great remake of a classic game. Brings back memories...
"LOVE THIS GAME! can't even begin to tell you how amazing this game is, I recommend it to anyone 10/10."
One of the best classics out there and a must for all libraries!
"It's the classic RTS reskinned for higher resolutions. No longer do you have to reconfigure your Windows Vista/7/8 system to specifically play this gem. No longer do you have to search the internet void for multiplayer games of AoE 2. It's back with a whole new multiplayer system available. If you feel nostalgic for those good-old-bad-old days of old-school RTSs, then grab your sword, raise your shield, and charge into AoE 2 HD.  Be warned: If you're used to the old hotkeys from the original AoE2 game, you'll have to reset them all or adapt to the new hotkey system (which is functional, although it just feels weird to not hit 'b' then 'e' to build a house...)."
"An older game but still so good. There are a lot of simularities to playing Terran on StarCraftII, but with almost a higher level of complexity. The campaign is still challenging and fun to run through."
"Awesome remake, definitely worth the nostalgia"
I have always been a massive fan of the Age of Empires series but when I saw this advertised on steam a few years ago I knew I had to get it.   Alot of people are dissapointed with this game and annoyed that it is barely any different or that they had to pay £15 for it. Firstly I managed to get it on sale so it was just under £4 (bargain) and I dont think the lack of change is a problem at all. In my opinion I think this is a perfect release for the AOE series. People LOVED this game when it came out and I know I played it alot when I was younger which is why this version is perfect for me and anyone else who fell in love with the originial game. The slightly retouched graphics are barely noticable but the introduction of steamworks and steamworkshop allow for ease of access for multiplayer games and the chat commands have become engrossed in normal conversation once again. Especially the famous WOLOLO. The contributions by other users on steamworkshop increase the quality of the graphics and allow for newer ways of playing the game and changing the textures etc for nearly any effect.  The only downside to this game is the single player is exactly the same. For me this is fantastic as I enjoy replaying games however it provides no new challenges and this might be a downside for other players. In this case I would suggest only buying this game if you know other people to play it with. But for players like myself it is perfect for reliving old memories and playing a game which is still plenty of fun.
Much exploration and many empires. Does as it says it would  10/10 would explore again
get this game already lmao
"Age Of Empires was my first game, and after more than one decade, I am still playing it. Buy it. Love it."
"Entirely unplayable game due to extreme lag, fps drops, and glitchiness. May the utmost shame be upon the developers of this 'HD' remake and anyone else involved in it's release. The developers of this release should give everyone their money back for this scam game and should be banned from having any games puchaseable on Steam. The thought that I almost paid the full price for this game makes me sick. This game has been out for two years now and the multiplayer is still entirely unplayable and the developers have NOT acknowledged or addressed the problem or given any remorse for their blatant problems. They expect us to port foward to try and address the issues? Really? Guess what, it doesn't help at all. This is a nostalgic money-trap that took everything that worked in the original game and made it worse. Buy the actual game instead and save yourself the trouble."
"Love this game! I used to play it all the time back on an old Pentium III PC, or, I played the original. I didn't play AoE II until 2008, but it is still a great game! Plus, it's been remastered in HD AND now it has a much higher NPC limit!  If you're looking for an RTS game to kill some hours, this is the game for you!  Summary:  Gr8 M8 I R8 8/8."
The best game of all time is back in 1080p! Need I say more?
"Aoe2 is the best game but its also the worst because you can never play as it lags and drops out all the time, impossible too play."
"AoE II is a 1999 2D isometric RTS game that marked an era on the RTS genre and this new version, luckily, just revamps it with widescreen/HD patches, a few bugfixes, reworked water/effects and steam workshop integration.  While widescreen/HD graphic support was a must have and there was no actual need for water or effects reworks, steam workshop integration is what makes this new version worth buying. On the workshop you're able to mod almost every part of the game, this increases even further the decennial longevity of this game. A few examples of currently available steam workshop items are: complete texture packs, water/coast mods, entire campaigns, extremely well made maps, ...  So, game system is exactly how AoE II was, one of the best ones ever among RTS games, extremely balanced and quite various, with slight but substantial differences between civilizations.  Graphic is good, not what you would expect from a 2013 game but strictly speaking about the HD port quality I couldn't think of any way it could have been done better.  Music got some nice remixes, most of them made it sound more 'medieval', which as far as I'm concerned it really nice.  In the end I'd say that even at full price (which is maybe 30%~35% more than you may expect from an HD port of a 10+ year old game) I'd recommend buying this game, mostly because of steam workshop integration that really made (and still makes) the difference on my gameplay experience."
I shouldnt have to say ♥♥♥♥ about this its a classic game thats been around since i was just a boy and if you havent heard of it 'Or starcraft' then go on and get your strategy on dont read reviews about it lol these games should have been beat YEARS ago haha
"Awesome game in the series, probably the best of the series. Does anyone remember the Star Wars game based off the game's engine? Anyhow, this was a fun game, espicially in school lol. I'm so glad they did an HD remake/update to this game. I hope they do the same with the first of the series as well."
"Even though the game is pretty old, still one of the best games I ever played! Alot better than 3, in my opinion, the best one! Going to get all(the) expansion(s)!"
Wanna waste a few hours? Play some Age of Empires II. And hey. It's in HD.
I played this game a lot when I was a kid and this game has certainly aged well. It's still a lot of fun and challenging. The game looks pretty much the same except for a few texture changes. The one great thing that this game features is a revised multiplayer part. Great fun!
Old but gold
Nice HD upscale of the original game. Not worth the full price tag of £14.99 as you can get the original for under £5 on Amazon. But worth a sale price deffinitely.
"I owned the original version of this game way back in the earlier 2000's and was sad to see one of my favorite games fall to compatability issue when I upgraded to Windows 7, this is the answer, the game is practically identical to the original version, and there's nothing wrong with that, I never really got into Age of Empires 3 but I loved Age of Empires 2, I didn't want any 'advanced game mechanics' or 'high end graphics', I wanted the exact same game I had before and that's exactly what I got.  Thanks Steam, You always pull through for me."
"Classic game with some upgrades in terms of pop limit, and updated textures. Still needs updates to match making (rather than just a old MSN style match making) but great to play with friends."
"This game truly brings back the nostalgia from MSN Gaming Zone days. If you were an Age of Empires fan of old and miss the 999 taunts, the epic deathmatches or crazy RPG scenarios, definitely buy this upgraded version. It is very worth it!"
Anyone that has played this when it was originally relesased will find the HD version of this game far more enjoyable and spend hours enjoying the battle animations and far superior sounds .... I still play thi game and i dont think i ll stop any time soon
"It is awesome that the population limit is extended to 500. The bad thing is that the multiplayers works sometimes and has bugs. Moreover, they should have included new features to the game and the 'hd' is just a joke. The diferences between this game and the original are not that big."
"I loved this game growing up, and I was very excited to see that a new, remastered, HD edition was released. I can now relive the game that I loved."
I like it. Rather nostalgic
Top stuff!
Please release a patch for tradiational chinese!!!
"Wow! I haven't played this in forever! Finally a game on Steam that actually allows multiplayer without the going through servers b.s., or at least from my past experiences anyways. I haven't tried the DLC content yet, but I can't wait to get back into this even more so than I did then.  RTS gaming with lots of options to choose from in terms of civilization, weaponry, etc.. A quick think-on-your-feet way to go head-to-head with friends and other players alike! Are you ready to rule and conquer? Give it your best shot with AoE2 in HD!!"
"who doesnt love this game? seriously. who. its incredible. one of the best, completely thought out RTS's ever made. any self respecting strategist has to own this game. its rustic and fun, and everything just feels....complete. its great in every way.  seriously, buy it."
"Being able to play this game again via Steam is wonderful. This game was my childhood and even all the years seperateing then and now, it still dominates. The HD version is great it does justice to the original game. Dont Look too closely at the Metacritic review because of course they didnt change the game they only enhanced the visuals. In conslusion the game was great when it was released in 1999, and still is."
Age of empires is one of the best games ever :D
"super nostalgic for me. not HD, but definatly a lot better than it used to be"
My sheep frontal attack was far from successful.  10/10  Next time I'll take archers too.
"What a classic! It is great to bring up the BEST RTS game of all time IMO. The HD in a slight enhancement. Not much really, but its still something. The game itself looks good anyway.   The new civilizations are great from the new Forgotten Expansion Pack.  AND thank jesus for the increase in population limit. Best feature, by far.   I hope this game never dies out."
A great classic game remade. Well done. Builds upon the greatness of the original.
the same fun as years ago
The AI is awful. Even on the hardest setting it just gave up! stopped making units &amp; villages even though it definelty had the resources to do so. Multiplayer against other players is good though.
"Nice update of an old classic! I already owned about 5 hard copies of this game, but TCP/IP multiplayer is kinda hard to deal with nowadays. When the Steam version came along, I leapt at the chance for easy multiplayer! I've since persuaded 8 or 10 of my friends to buy copies themselves, along with The Forgotten DLC."
This game is cash.
Just great..
"I love this game because unlike most other strategy games, this is not turn based!"
They've basically got it right.
Classic!
"A classic game that holds up decently well. Give it a chance if it plays weird, it takes awhile to get used to it."
"They managed to ruin one of my favourite games, LAN has been removed, the resolution is simply too high, it ruins performance and makes the game ugly. Uninstalled after much disappointment."
one of my all time faverate game should really get if you like any stratagey game however its a bit pricey.
This game is amazing and really well balanced
Good. One of the best old RTS games out there.
"amazing game, always has been always will be"
Standard multiplayer crashes a lot! It is a great game that held a lot of fun for many many years and with HD even better But why so many bugs?
"This game is worth the price. It has both single player and multi-player FUN!! It's nice to have to think strategy while playing a game, which is different from most games now a days."
One of the classics! Played it back in the day and still play it now. Totally worth it
"A great and very nostalgic game ,Besides the old gameplay and features there’s internet multiplayer and now you can have up to 500 units all in HD !! Spent hours playing :)"
"I miss enjoying playing this game when I first started playing pc games and it was one of my favorite game to play with my family and friends. when i saw this steam, first it was kinda unstable, but after getting use to it and checking out the new civilizations in the dlc, it still bring back memories of my childhood so 8/10 if the game wasn't glitch out when i attack with large number of armies"
"Forge your empire and destroy all the enemy buildings and kill all of they villagers and units... Or you can die trying. You start with a town building, five villagers and a horse unit... Good luck!"
The best game PERIOD!!!!
"One of my top five favorite games ever, now refinished in HD on Steam. While it may not be as great of an 'HD' remake as it could have been potentially (Good, just sacrificed a lot of potential), that's not the reason for buying this game. Steam support is just what is needed for this otherwise timeless (and in some cases ahead of its time) RTS that can hook you for..uhh.. how long has it been? Twelve years."
i havent played this since i was a kid and its 2015 and i still love it!
Good old classic game with some slightly improved visuals. Internet connection is better now and you can play via steam.
"For anyone new to the franchise or this particular game I highly recommend purchasing this game. In my opinion one of the best RTS games available and after 15 years still has an active online presence.  However, referring specifically to the HD remake, it is overpriced for what is a very minimal enhancement to your gaming experience."
Cees is The best OOP MLGER 360 nocper
Great to play with friends. No need to bring laptops and router to play like used to be.
"One of my favorite all time games. Less graphics then AoE III, but way more playable."
"The best of the best in the RTS genre. I have played this game since it first came out and continue to enjoy it just the same. The new HD version campaigns are nothing spectacular but that's not why I purchased it. Super accessable and easy to use multiplayer, new civs, frequent sales, and improved graphics make this game a steal."
"The gameplay is super, truly a great game to be played by anyone who loves medieval strategy games. The graphics give it a more familiar feeling to it, and there's a wide variety of civilizations to choose from. This is a game that you better clear your schedule for a few hours, because it's hard to stop playing in the middle of a game."
"A faithful HD remake of the original. Nothing has been changed, mechanically, they gave the textures a slight update to work with higher resolutions and ever so slightly prettier, while keeping the aesthetics of the original game. This is the classic game that everyone who got it at the time knew and loved, and I cannot recommend it or praise it any higher than that, as odd as it might sound"
This game is sooooo deep and so addictive. It's awesome how there's no one way to winning! Deep game
Relive the glory days of one of the best RTS released. maybe the 'HD' upgrades are rather limited but the fun is intact
Classic Real Time Strat game.  Lots of different civilizations to play as with their own unique soldier types and strategies  Its nice to see it remastered into HD.  Fun game if you like the sort of thing
The classic in HD. Expansion probably only worth the money if you really want it.
"Age of Empires II is a classic as you're all aware. Not the most complex econemy system but you do have to remember that it came out in 1999. What it does it does very well with little to no complaints gameplay wise. The learning curve isn't as bad as you might think it to be - easy to learn, hard to master. The 'HD' portion of Age of Empires II HD isn't all that great. Not much as changed since its 1999 release. It does look 'better' but not as much as many had hoped for. I enjoyed this game very much and it is possible to sink many many hours into it."
THE greatest RTS ever created
"♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. I've had the original since it came out and when it came out on Steam I had to have it. It's even better than I remember it and they're now releasing new content for it. Obviously the community is quite devoted to keeping the game alive. 9/10, would buy."
Age of Empires! Rogan! Wololo!
Awesome Game. Fun to play with friends!
"This was the first videogame I've literally ever played, and I've loved it ever since.  Siege Weaponry OP  Spam Teutonic Knights"
I've been playing this game since it came out long ago. Till this day i love it and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes basic stradegy war games
"This game is like one of the best games for RTS. It is like C&amp;C, the way you build your base and build troops. The only thing is, it is more strategic and not fast-paced. If you played R.U.S.E, or know it, it is similar to that where every unit has its strength and weaknessess. The numbers game sometimes matter. Has a ton of replay value. 10/10  "
"Best game of all time! I highly, very highly, recommend!!!!"
Love it just Great
""
Great strategy game
Still the best rts game ive ever played! And this hd version including the recent expansion forgotten empires. Makes this game even better.
Just so much yes
This game defined my childhood. I played this the most out of my games and well worth it's weight in gold (not sure how you would weigh this game). If you don't own this game you are seriously missing out.
It's ok
"Now when i recommend this take heed that I recommend Age of Empires and not the HD, because it's more like lets charge 5 more pounds. Anyway, one of the classics, if not the classic, with the exception of it's forebear to the stratagy genre. there are some quarms which, have only gotten worse with age unfortunately. Now unless you follow the 'how to win insrction manuel' then you will raely win aganist one opponant of standard diffculty, unless you have learned the 'How to win manuel'. Yes this seems to be the games biggest fault. The AI will always do exactly the same thing each time and will always win unless you spend a good long while on learning how to beat them. This by the way never exsisted in the pre HD versions so Microsoft must have cocked some up.  However, that aside, it's a great way to make exciting campaigns of your own, like the Hundred years war or something like that. There are variety of mods on this game as well, which are worth a look. The campaigns themselves can also be fun and are good for polishing your skills so that you can actually beat that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a AI. Playing with friends and family in multiplayer is also fun and easy to do, (Unless their one of those that looked at the 'how to win manuel').  The important thing is to do what you enjoy with this game and only do that, if you put your self through a tedious slog just so you can compete a competion with your friends then dont put this down and play something else becuase you wont enjoy it. But also do remeber that this game is older than alot of us and you have to take the inadiquacies with a pinch of salt but pther from that a real classic."
"My number 1 favourite strategy game of all time, runs on almost any pc i used to play this on a pc with 1gb or ram, and a graphics card which had 512mb in other words this system was awful, buy this game!"
this game is awsome i sugest getting it 
Awesome older Strategiegame. Had alot of fun playing it with friends.
"The quintessential RTS game, as fun and engaging as it was when it came out... what... 16 years ago? Easy to learn, near impossible to master, and an astoundingly large community for such an old game. Amazing multiplayer system, complete with ELO ratings and a decent lobby browsing system. Highly recomended"
"18 Years ago I got really heavily into AoEII as an active members of the Ldz_ clan. Ldz_Chopper. Found this on steam again, and fell back in love with it 18 years on. Great to see content is still being developed for it without taking away from its original, like the subsequent titles became. A great civ strat game, possibly the greatest."
"Age of empires? Re released? Multiplayer? NEW expansions? Well, i suppose i can't say no to that, can I? "
Recommended to all mah frendz n fans
"I love this game in all its simplicity. No fancy units just build a big army, navy or both and break stuff! Yes, the AI isn't very clever and depending on how many units you are trying to move, you have to help them do the most basic of things like going somewhere but for me, that's one of the charms. For me, at my age? Simple is GOOD. This one is in my top 3 favorite RTS games."
why erro 53???
"Any game that is still fun after 10 years is a sucess. One day I know it will be deleted from my hard drive, but I just cant bring myself to do it now."
This game is a great throwback. I love playing with my friends and even agasint the (modded) AI. The only problem I have with the game is the multiplayer. Getting kicked out of every room because you haven't played multiplayer in 8 years it's sad. Obviously not the games fault but if you are wanting to play online make sure you tell everyone you're using a smurf.
Good ole AOE2.  Pro: It's AOE2 Con: It's AOE2  Overall 10/10
"This one went up fast because I’ve already had a chance to sink 20+ hours into in the preceding weeks. I was no newcomer to the RTS genre, but I was a newcomer to the Age of Empires franchise until my girlfriend bought us each a copy while it was on sale during the Steam Summer Sale. And am I glad that she did.  Age of Empires II: HD Edition is (as the name would suggest) the high definition remake of the classic RTS game Age of Empires II from Hidden Path Entertainment and Ensemble Studios.  The Good  I’ll be very straightforward here: I’m not very good at RTS games. That being said, I still thoroughly enjoy playing RTS games, despite my lack of strategic wisdom. While old, AoE2 is a fun, addictive game. You have a vast array of civilizations to chose from (each featuring their own cultural advantage, unique unit(s), and some have access to technologies that others do not), good graphics, and simple controls. The point here is that you have lots of options. Options are a good thing. A very, very good thing.  Combat is easy enough to understand: certain units are strong against certain units, etc. If you bring a bunch of cavalry to a polearm fight, you’re going to have a bad time. And, yes, that is bitter experience talking. However, even when the chips are down for you, the struggle to survive is still fun. The desperate scrambling to gather resources and pump out units to replace your annihilated army has a certain charm to it.  The Bad  While I understand the graphical limitations of the days in which this game was originally released, with this version being the high def remake, I was saddened to see that most units look largely the same for every civilization. This excludes unique units (hence the unique part) and the buildings do change a bit depending on what your civilization’s culture is like and what part of the world they’re from.  The Meh  See above.  Verdict: Yea  Age of Empires II: HD Edition is a great game and the first game we’ve been able to recommend since our return from hiatus. If I hadn’t have received it as a gift, I wouldn’t have felt bad about buying it. If you’re a fan of the franchise or a fan of RTS, this may be a great investment for you. As always, thanks for reading."
probably the best old school game out on steam.
"Man the French campaign is so hard, I got stuck on the mission on trying to destroy 3 castles. Nevertheless, this is one of those timeless strategy classics."
Excellent game…no game will compete with age of empires 2! :D
"if you like strategy and want to know what really boosted the pc versions of modern strategy, then this game is a good choice."
"This is a classic game with a fresh coat of paint and some upgrades. I like how it looks and in multi-player it runs pretty smooth with only a few noticeable moments of lag. The AI improvements are pretty nice. Tougher then it used to be back in the day. I think the only downside I can see is the price. $20 is a lot for an old game even with the improvements. Overall if you like RTS I'd suggest getting this game, but wait until there is a sale."
awesome game. community is so pro. hard to win if you are an average player. only good thing had been created by microsoft. sad that its not working on linux. ♥♥♥♥ you microsoft. this game is one of two reasons that i still got poor windows in a part of my computer. other is blizzard...
great old game. always fun to go back to it.
"Growing up I really enjoyed playing Age of Empires 2. I was very excited to see that Microsoft made a updated HD verison of this game. The game itself is the same with some enhancements for modern systems. I also love the fact that it encorperates easy internet gameplay. In addition, I think its amazing that they released a DLC for this game from the modding community. It really shows that they care about the gamers and what the gamers want. The only con I have found for this game is that when there are a large number of units on the screen there can be significant lag, it is really noticiable in late game battles."
best game ever! it is very fun to play. 
"This game is really fun if you like having fun, but if you like to win, it gets really hard. "
Awesome strategy game for all peeps!
"Age of Empires holds a huge chunk of my childhood and my heart. I loved this game now and damn do I still love it now. I just cannot get bored of it! I accidently exploded my disk of the game so having it on Steam is a god send, my brother and my Dad both play it on here too, we all love the game! The Forgotten is an awesome expansion and adding the new civilisations help to create an new interest in the game. If you played this game originally in 1999 or 2000 then you already know why you need to play AoE. If not then come out from under your rock! The new campaigns in the expansion are a bit of a let down, there is no voice acting, which was a fun quirk from the original game, however the content is still great. Although games may seem repetitive, the choice of civilisations and single player game modes help to keep the game interesting and fun. I hope that my children's children will still be playing AoE."
Still an excellent game after all these years. The HD upgrade is very well done. One of the best RTS ever made but can also be very hard on certain settings.
Great game
"After the bug where it crashes after 5 minutes of game play, my life has come to a signifigant low. I live in an endless 5 minute loop of starting the game, getting kicked out and then back from the start, my life expectancy is plummeting as i write this.. i need to reopen the game soon again or brain = Slushy ..  Brb trying again"
"Anoying low FPS count problem persists after a bunch of patches. In single player when you have a population of +50 (aprox) the frame rate drops to a 5-11 range. I used to play the original AoE 2 Conquerors in my actual PC and never had this problem. I'm still awaiting a solution to it. Don't buy it, first download it from other source and try the FPS of the game, that way you won't dump money in something unplayable...like i did."
The nostalgia is real.
"Imagine you are walking through a forest and an arrow comes out of the darkness and kills you. That is pretty much how this game works. I can recommend this game because of its intense battles of siege and navy background. You can accumulate massive armies and fleets of boats to bombard your opponents(which is VERY satisfying). After a while it gets a little boring because there is only a small number of game modes but If you can get past the graphics and see the game as it was meant to be, you will have endless fun playing this game.  8/10"
Classic strategy game.  I love a game that lets me choose who I am and reap the rewards of that decision. Like Byzantinian walls.
"This game is probably one of the best isometric RTS games in the entire universe. This may be a bold claim but its not demanding of your system, gameplay is solid, doesnt have annoying ♥♥♥ music playing in background, and yada yada yada. Its here, its queer, get used to it.  GOLD TEAM RULES!"
"Family favorite since it came out, and still a go-to game when we are looking for something to play."
Great game. Glad this came out with new units and campaigns. Opening up the game to the community for mods and extras is just brilliant.
7/10
Classic.
really well done. same game just better. kind of sucks that the new content dont run as fast as it should. turned off 3d water and that helped with lagging. 8/10
"This game is my all-time favorite strategy game ever since I was 10, mostly on the Age of Kings. For this HD version of this game, my final rate of this game is 9.5 out of 10. Thus, it brings me a lot of nostaglic memories for playing challenging campaigns, random maps, and scenario map editor."
Lovley game from my childhood. Best played with friends against either players or really hard computers!
"Nothing beats the old school RTS, great game to play with friends!"
If this gem isn't in your library you need to hang your head in shame.
"When they said remake the game I thought they'd at least rewrite the networking part and the UI so it DOESNT BUG OUT SO DAMN MUCH  When you put the bugs aside though, you get quite possibly the best RTS game ever made. :)"
"Such a classic game, it's definitely a throw back to the original. If you are feeling a bit nostalgic pick this up and play for a few hours. Kick back and play with a couple friends as well!"
Faithful reworking of the original that brings it up to modern computer's standards but without changing the core game.
"Hours of fun, even if I am pants at it."
"If Age of Empires II HD is added to steam, then add Star Wars Galactic BattleGrounds, too. You would make a ton of people happy, including myself. Also, add the Clone Campaigns.  Thanks, :)"
"This is an old favourite of mine. Fantastic game and never gets old, despite its age. Would recommend."
"I'm not going to lie, I still have my original release of Age of Empires II with the Conquerors expansion, so why did I buy it again on Steam?   It's because they updated the graphics so that my computer doesn't freak out every time I steart up the game. It's because they created new content, an entire expansion with new campaigns and new units that I do not ever recall coming across before. And lastly, it's because after all these years, it's still a good game."
Best game ever! I wish Age of empires online was still... well... online. But this one does the job. 
"SUPERB, Steam Community Work Shop - 8K + Mods Multiplayer/ Single Player - High Replay Value AOE 2 has successuflly passed the test of time."
"I've been playing this game for 15 years now, still haven't played Baltic.  15/20 don't point that thing at me"
"I have yet to try the multiplayer in this version, but worth buying for the campaign alone."
"An old classic that has been improved upon with better graphics and added civilizations. I have played this game for years and never stopped enjoying it, espesially regicide battles. Some truely desperate battles have been fought. Loads of fun. Very worth the money."
"The all-time best RTS was released in 1999, and now you can play it with native widescreen support. There's really nothing else to add."
So nostalgic. Really takes me back.  The new AI is quite smart...  Oohlulu!
Its a good time
"It's a classic, clear and simple. Compared to newer strategy games, it's prehistoric, but I would still rather play this. I liked the fact it's concise, anyone (who's a gamer) will easily be able to figure out how to play. But, as I said earlier, it is a classic. This means that it has plenty of problems, such as connection issues and bad graphics. So, if you want to take that step into strategy gaming, then Age of Empires II is a great place to start. It is, in my opinion, the original Strategy Game. Here's my walkthrough of the campaign, feel free to check it out!  http://youtu.be/gp9oP-6rR5o "
Great game. Just as good as I remember.
If you are interested in playing a classic then its a classic.
"Yes, I recommend this game; however I have a question and can't figure out how to ask it; so here is my review question, please. Has steam done any upgrading that would have made it impossible for me to play my old disk copy of Age of Empires II Expansion since September 6th, 2015, which is a much faster game, and though not as imaginative as the HD Forgotten Campaigns, it is still kicks ♥♥♥. I have had Steam for a couple years and off and on, mostly on, and I have played from the old disk as well, but now, though my computer reads that I have it still installed and the window with push play still comes up--it just never starts. Also we network it at home on four computers for family. The machines whirr 'on the disk' then stop and nothing comes up, even the day before, September 6, 2015, the disk version worked perfectly. Yes, I tried reinstalling but nothing changed--same almost a start but no. So help. I am sure it is Steam because I have Steam on my lap top as well, and my ability to play the old game off the disk went on both computers on the same day. Please contact me at  phillipcwagner99@hotmail.com  if you have any ideas how I can get that puppy back on. Best Wishes, P. Wag (please identify your email as 'Steam friend response' if you have time for this crazy review question)"
"Best game ever, brought back in HD. i must have 4000h of it offline. and 500 on hd edition this is the game you can escape to, if ur just doing multiplayer.. or challenging 1v7 hardest new AI's. its a blast.  I recommend this to everyone =)."
An ultimate classic. RTS at it's finest.
"The greatest RTS ever made period. With the online mods and game modes people have created there are so many different ways to play this game, from tower defense games to all out mayhem in castle blood. However this wouldnt be possible without the core game which is truly excellent and has not been topped by any RTS in my opinion. 10/10"
"village attacks building with dagger, building catches fire aztec house made of stone cost wood"
"The same old instant classic game, except the graphics are better, the AI is better, population cap is increased, and now with the use of Steam workshop, it makes modifying elements of the game so much easier. What's not to love?"
"the remake of classic AoE2 suffers from a few AI bugs which make the game not nice to play on larger maps with bigger armies, apart from that - awesome!"
Good - Cool Old Game like in Old Days ! Thx Valve for ADD IT ! GG
Aah! one of the most impactful strategy game in history of video games. It bring back the memories of college LAN parties.
OK wow. I loved the origional but this is somthing else. 10/10
"Fantastic game if you enjoyed the Age of Empire collection. If you enjoy unique qualities in an RTS, this game is for you!"
Good Game 11/10 (Time has only made this old girl better)
"Thanks to Steam, I can once again enjoy one of the first strategy games I ever played, plus a little more. It will always be a classic in my heart. Also thanks to Steam, I feel like a total dumbass because I got it a day before it was 75% off!! Thanks, Steam. You are a bitter sweet companion."
This is a really great game that I love so much!!!!!
Epic revamp new teams with the expansion and plays very smooth worth the $20 
Anything can happen in this game!
i love it becuase it gives me erectoins 
"Oh so many memories are flooding back to me playing this game. I am thrilled to see Age of Empires 2 return to the gaming scene. I can't think of a more perfect excecution either, steam seems to be the perfect platform for this historic game. With the increased multiplayer support and the use of the steam workshop to share and enjoy each other's mods/maps is superb.  Was also pleased to see this game has added more content in addition to the rather noticable graphical changes. I can't really fault the game, it's exactly as I remember it. While vastly improved it still has that same nostalgic feel with the addition of a fresh feel, like I am stepping into it all over again. I would like to thank the developers at Hidden Path and Ensemble Studios for doing this game justice in this remastered edition. Fabulous job! Highly recommend it to anyone, even if you didn't play the original this a worthwhile game to buy.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mate on the other line bugging me for a rematch and I particularly want to get him back for ruining my wonder victory ;)."
Now you can convert catapults to christianity while you set stonewall on fire with swords and ask your only villager to repair your Wonder...  ... in High Definition.
"I have played this game on-and-off for just over half of my life, and I've absolutely no intention of stopping any time soon. It's the best RTS game ever made if not the best game period. As for the HD Edition, it felt kind of wonky at first, but the Steam Workshop integration and the numerous patches have made it well worth the pricetag."
"Best RTS I've ever played, my time played truely doesn't reflect the hours upon hours I used to play this game as a kid. 10/10 would recommend"
"This was an amazing game back in the day, it is even better now due to the addition of DLC and it being on steam. This a great buy for anyone."
"It's everything awesome that I remember from 1999 plus more since I never actually owned the Conquerors expansion (which comes with a base purchase of AoE II Extended Edition). There were some serious issues with performance and stuttering when it was first released but they seem to have rectified it for the most part as of writing this. The Steam Workshop integration is great and full of lots of good mods. If you were a big fan of the original like I am and would like to play it smoothly on modern hardware, this is $20 well spent."
One of my all time favourite games! worth all your money! buy it! I've been playing on and off for about 14 years!
Timeless game. It's brilliant. Obviously the best of the 3.
"One of the very best RTS ever made! If you don't know it, buy and play it, now!"
New water and fire    10/10 would water and fire for 20€ again
"Laaaging like hell, I purchased two copies of this game for me and my bro, both of us are having the same issue, both in singleplayer and multiplayer. I love this game so much...but this lag is ruining it... :-("
Classic!! AoE never gets old.
"This game holds it's own, a medieval Command and Conquer, sure there are better graphics available these days, but I still enjoy playing this today."
"It's finally fixed and thanks to SteamWorks, you can mod this puppy to look a lot more pretty."
"I loved AOE II in my youth and was looking forward to playing it again with some better res.  Don't bother buying this version, all they did is port the thing to some new OS and basicly added some resolutions, the rest is still just as the old version. Might as well play that one."
This game came out a year after I was born and already has done more than I'll ever do.  10/10 Meme Simulator 1999
A game which is over looked because of its graphics. Grab it when it goes on sale!
Multiplayer is so lag :(
Best strategy game ever I got it when it first came out and still playing it today
a pretty good retro
"Amazing game, but this HD edition barely adds anything. Not worth getting if you already have the original AoE 2."
"This is an amazing game and has stood the test of time, outclassing it's own successor. Since I bought this in 1999 (I think), I keep coming back to it, despite pulls from subsequent releases (AOE 3, C&amp;C x tons, etc).  The graphics are a little dated and the HD version really doesn't add much to the experience but there is so much to do and achieve that I still think I'll be playing it in 40-50 years (it'll definitely outlive me)!"
"It's purely old days, you will love this if you spend time at the old good AoE games. Online is crowded aswell..."
Classic game!I picked it up recently and found it still bring me so much fun.
Enjoyed playing the game again..it was nice to be able to play in 1080. The only down-side is that it seems like they cut out the ability to play a LAN multiplayer game...
"The best real time strategy game i've ever played - even played it as a child. I know it since the official release in the late 1990's. The battles in this game are awesome, you've got a lot of units and i promiss, it won't get boring. There are a lot of campaigns with great stories where you can learn a bit about the Middle Ages.  Get it! ;-)"
love this game!
"Great Game, Not bad, not good. I start play this game when I see in my friend house disc with soliders. I tell him, 'what is this game?' and he answer to me, 'This is my brother game. Its hard game if you want, I can give you this game and you can try to play.' I tell him, 'yeah why not :D' 2 Days after I come to him and tell him, 'This game so easy ! why you told me its hard game?' and he say, 'to me its hard :('  Today, after 5 years I stopped play this game.  Thx for reading. -Max"
"Where to start? It came out over 15 years ago and I'm still playing. A fantastic game to begin with and now massively enhanced with a great HD version. Brilliant dev support also, updates are coming out regularly to correct bugs (mostly graphical but also to AI). There is a great multiplayer culture, the campaigns are challenging, and enough single player modes (and achievements to aim for) to keep you busy for years. A thoroughly excellent RTS game that has stood the test of time."
"If you buy this game, you can play it with meeeee! Oh and it's excellent just fyi. But you knew that. C'mon. It's AOE2. But HD!!!!!1!!!21 (may not be hd)."
Just the HD update AOE2 needed
Love this! Reminds me of the old days. :D
Great.
This review is easy. The game is balanced and very fun. TIMELESS CLASSIC. RTS MUST HAVE. STILL GOT A SOLID ONLINE POPULATION though expect your skill to be tested. GIVE THE DEVS YOUR MONEY. DO IT NOW. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING&gt; BUY BUY BUY !
"If you've ever liked any other real-time strategy game in this classical style, then you'll clearly see why this one deserves so much credit"
"It's back to an old classic and with online play! I hope there are new DLC expansions for more civilizations and more, this game really makes worth every penny :) &lt;3"
Just Like Age of Empires II but this one is HD... cpt.obvios strikes again.
"I remember coming home from school 10 or so years ago, sitting at the table and playing AoE2, and thinking 'I wish I was alive then.'  The game brings a lot of fun to your life, even 10 or even more years on it is still a very enjoyable experience. Heck, it's not just an RTS, it is a source of inspiration. I have a love of ancient history bought on by AoE2. And if that doesn't say enough? It has a new expansion, worth the £7.00 spent on it, and worth the amount spent on it for the base game.  9.9x10^9/10 - would play forever."
"Age of Empiers 2 was my 1st game. I grew up with it and now i found it on steam again. So many memories and so good game. If u think to buy it, just do it. Just play with friends and it will be so fun.  "
it's a nice game. you can play it for a long time and still will not get bored :D
Age of Empires............Its...Age of Empires...Everybody who says 'AOE SUCKS YOO' are these 12 year old CoD kids who fap while cheating....Shortly said only trolls and idiots say that 
"This game is VERY addictive. Playing as any ancient civilizations from the Byzantine Empire, to the Ottoman Turks. Playing online does take some time getting used to, as everyone likes to get castles very fast.   I would also like to mention, this game isn't very historically accurate, while you should mostly focus on the gameplay.    "
"Best game ever, used to play it when i was young, 10/10"
This is one of my favorite games from my childhood and I'm so glad it is on Steam now!
"classic game, good for conquering your enemies, and then your friends. sometimes in that order"
"This is the masterpiece RTS that came from that great era. i would suggest this game too all players new or old, casual or hardcore, genuis or joe you can find fun in any way you play in this game."
"Made male villagers. Had them farm. Made female villagers. Had them mine, chop wood, and die.  10/10 Would be sexist again"
"I played this way back when as a kid, and it may be nostalgia, but it is easily worth the buy. I sank so many hours into it as a kid and I found myself doing that all over again. The HD is a nice update, and there's a number of cool texture packs to further bump it up if you want. It's an amazing game and it's definately worth a try."

Loved it for several months. Now it won't load. I tried reinstalling the game to no avail. Just gets stuck on the a validating screen =(
"Not quite as I remembered it when I first played it YEARS ago, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing. To say the least, it has held up well enough to be fun to play with friends. Honestly, its up to you if you want to buy it, but I still say it is worth the small price to re-live some old memories."
You can't assign your hotkeys.... Wtf? why not? Is Steam just ♥♥♥♥♥♥? good game but how to play if you dont have your hotkeys omg.
It might be an Old game but it's still beautiful!
My favorite RTS game of all time. 9.0

pretty good rts  sound files are fire
i bought this for my compaq computer. the compaq computer recently stopped working(its being real slow) therefore useless. and now i have a mc computer and it won't let me play it on here. it says the platform isn't right or something. so i need help on that..?
Awesome game much pleased thanks all.
"One of the first PC game I ever played as a child and I loved every second I invested into this RTS. Now as an adult and introducing me to a HD version of the game with steam workshop mods, achievements and trading cards...you have possibly one of my favorite games of this genre sorted and done! Well worth getting this game even if it's not on offer, well worth the full RRP for all the stuff you get. The campaigns are amazing and all historically based with extra resources on the back story to the empires and nations within the game for you to browse through at your own leisure. The game play is first class and is outstanding as goes without saying for a game title of the caliber. You'll find yourself trying to solve a scenario, then getting frustrated you'll start a random map, get better then hit it again and win. Then only to repeat the cycle and then continue on to start making your own little adventures and campaigns in the map editor. This game is a must have in any PC gamers library!"
"The game has a huge potential, but it has a lot of bugs. These bugs usually subside in certain gamemodes and if you play with people with a good connection."
"AoE2, what more can you say? One of the best RTS's from last 20 years, need more to have HD remakes now."
"An amazing game, one of the very classics of its genre.  The game itself deserves a 10/10, but I'm just shortly going to rate the steam HD version of it.  +Steam multiplayer! +New civilizations!  -'High definition' doesn't work or support with older monitors (4:3) -Very poor options menu, some of the older options are removed. Would expect more from a HD version.   6/10. Wouldn't recommend buying it for its full price."
I want to play this game right meow!
Years of play in every pixel
Here is my childhood along with super mario RPG.
great game. brigns me back to the old days when i had my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc and was barely able to play the game
"One of my favorite games of all time. Simple, yet it has the emergent property of being a very good strategy game!"
One of my favorite games ever played in my childhood :)
"Classic. I consider myself a reasonably hardcore gamer and there is no game that I have played so much over such a long period of time. It's a game of chess in a video game. Every little game is different and there's nothing more satisfying than struggling, but battling through it coming back and winning. Good stuff"
"I needed Stone for my walls, so I stole my allies stone mines. I then acquired his gold fields because I had none. Then when it was time to fight, I retreated into my walls and let my ally resign as he lacked the gold to recruit an army.  10/10"
"You need alot of free time for this game, dont think your just going to play this for an hour at a time. This takes a very long time just to finish one match. This is extremly fun to play with and against friends, can also be enjoyable playing by youself.  I highly reccomend this to anyone that likes these types of games, wont be time wasted."
"Non-stop competitive RTS fun! 1-on-1, team vs. team, or free-for-all!  The game is easy enough for a first timer to RTS games, but complex enough to be entertaining for hundreds of hours. Most fun experienced when friends join in the mix. The basic idea is that every match starts off with players trying to expand and strengthen their civilizations to overcome their opponents. Every civilization has strengths, weaknesses, and unique units. The beginning of the match is the calm before the storm with everyone building up their respective resources and armies. It really trains your brain to be swift at multitasking. Fast-forward to about an hour or so in the game when the fight for victory begins and the tension mounts! There's a multitude of various strategies to go about buillding your civilization and defeating your enemies. Every match will be a different experience which what makes the replay value immense! With various win conditions, fully customizable match options, and different games types, you'll never get bored of playing over and over again!  "
15 years old and still my top game. Only game that I have ever played that has provided so many diverse gameplay options through scenarios.
so this game is a blast from the past for sure with its rich open world rts style gameplay! id deffinatly recomend this games to my friends and other strategy gamers. the new hd does make it a lil easier to see ai and buildings while still having the old stlye relevant. a new addition is the special troops they give you in the campeign always having a nice variety is a good change no more will i have to spam pike men and skirmishers.=) speaking of the campiegn the storys are well written even though for some reason they cut out all audio i mean even in actual gamplay you have to hold progress so u can squint to read the tiny text box on the upper left. but the game play is nice and the adventures you take are well worth the time.   one last major flaw i have with the game is alot of times the ai seems slow and un cordinated often times getting stuck or going the complete opposite way you tell it to go sometimes you can also get stuck in your own city having buildings some how blocking the way i notced this alot with heavly wooded areas (easy fix with patches but i havent seen them yet)   all in all a good game though it sometimes feels like the developers gave it a half hearted attempt considering the ai being stupid and the voice acting being cut id give this game a 7/10 great game with a few minor bugs. good buy
"One of the most classic, one of the greatest, RTS games of all time.  Updated for modern hardware.  Worth every ounce of gold."
"The game is just awesome, all the memories are comming back :')"
I feel like a terrorist when i blow up a ship with people inside :( 11/9
"I wish I didn't have to be another of those people saying they had this game when they were a kid, and got it now but still like it, but eh. I got this game at Staples of all places idk how long ago. But man, what an amazing game."
"This game is not just for nostalgia seekers! I was introduced to this game for the first time by a friend over a year ago. I was discouraged at first (due to the beatings I got) but as I played more, I realized that it's by far the best purchase I've made on Steam. The online gameplay could be challenging; but it is rewarding since it helps build strategy, and versing AI is also quite entertaining and helpful for newcomers. One of my favorite ways of playing is creating massive games filled with friends (preferably ones you know for stronger diplomacies) and having extraordinary battles. All of the civilizations feel well balanced with their own pros and cons, and the DLC doubles the fun with amazing new features and civilizations. It's a must buy in any agenda!"
"An excellent game that teaches a lot about history and the rise and fall of civilizations through its mechanics. It doesn't live up to the HD part, but is an absolute must play if you are at all interested in history or real time strategy games."
too much fun
Great game to bring back the nostalgia especially the Wololo sound. Constant fun and no traces of the feeling of boredom. Everything about this game is classic and addicting.
"The greatest game of all time HD remastered, what more could you want?"
This Game is really fun to play. It is quite time Consuming however if you like RTS and are in for some microing this is the game you wanna play. It has improved graphics since the HD edition and the gameplay has been improved aswell. It doesnt lag that often anymore due to too many Units. Now the endgame can be played flawlessly and be enjoyed just as much as the early stage of the game. I recommend it very much to players that like RTS.
"My inner child screams every time I play this game because this is one of my very first childhood games.  If you're now an adult and played this as a child, then you absolutely have to buy it and relive those times again. You won't be disappointed.   A game that you still feel like playing 16 years after it was released pretty much says it all."
"I used to watch my brother playing Age of Empires all the time when I was a child. After a few years I began to play it too. Age of Empires inspired me to become a gamer, so yes, I definitely recommend it!"
"One of the bedst news for a long time ! If hope to see more old games come in HD, playable on new, fast computers ! This game works flawless, and is a lovly reunification."
Same old clasic game with updated graphics
This is a classic game and the remake with the Forgotten has made it even better.
What I played before Total War :P
"Fun game, exactly how i remmeber."
This is the best gme inthe whole world since 1st ever released. I have played this game since 1999 at least. I love to make maps. Fun war game.
"Better then Starcraft 2, this game is so hard to master that in all my years of playing i still suck. I Feel its Mecanicis are much more comp;lex and compleeing then most Rts, i dont feel i do anything the same ever due to the different Civs and there strong points. where as i feel that Sc is more of your basic chess game."
"I suck but it was still kinda fun, until the AI obliterated me with unjust fury the likes of man has never seen before. Still might be better with friends."
Was great until it started crashing. This needs to be fixed or I want my money back
"I have AOEI, AOEII and AOM and i like them all. If you like strategy games, i recommend playing all AOE games."
"I Have PLayed the original AOE2,and i can say this AOE2HD is Awesome!!!"
Check out my hours played!
"My second favorite RTS, My first being Empire Earth.   Age of Empires 2 was quite a big part of my late childhood and early teen years. To see a HD remake is enthralling and it has been done well with the best mod being made fully supported!  Pros: Really easy to pick up, being this is what most people played to get into RTS games. Great diversity within the units, although the huns are still the most OP people. Great Campaigns which follow history's best and brightest. Graphics and sounds are so low-end anyone can run it but still enjoy them. Awesome for competitive matches with your friends or just as a fun weekend game. Map Editor allows for even more fun and the ability to trade maps with friends. Workshop Mods.  Cons: Huns are literally the 'Go-To' race to win with literally no skill."
"Love this game! Been a fan since the original, many years ago, and this one definitly keeps the tradition alive!"
Best game I ever played. My number of hours pretty much sum it up.
"I have been playing this game since a kid. It is a most excelent game. In multiplayer, you can wag war, make alliances, create trade agreements. in singleplayer, you can fight your enemies. in the harder difficulties the AI might forge an alliance with you. Manage your resourses well and defend your town. This is one of the best strategy games ever."
"Great turn based game. Highly Consider you install this one. Ps. Your game maybe 4 hrs long, lol"
Best game of all times!
cant beat classics
"Solid RTS, great way to waste hours of your life."
This is a great throwback. AOE2 was what got me into computer games. The mods take the game to a whole new level.
Roses are red Wololo Roses are blue  10/10
"10/10 nostalgia factor  100% Great game, especially with friends!"
"I'm so happy they came out with the HD edition, I spent endless hours in this game as a kid and it's still fun to pop in now."
"Strategy classic, one of the best LAN games ever and a little piece of gaming history, yes buy it."
"This is probably one of the very first RTS games i have ever played, and now it's even better with HD graphics. the HD graphics aren't amazing but they do help the game look better than normal, and they is some workshop support that will make it look even better"
"START THE GAME ALREADY!  By far the high water mark of all the 'Age' games, AOE2 is still as good to pick up and play 15 years on as it was all those years ago. Whether you're fighting a human opponent or you just want to waste some time sacking computer kingdoms, every RTS fan needs this in their library."
"OK, I don't even know where to start. I've played AOE 2 for years and years, and this is a great revival. Same mechanics for those people (like me) who want great gameplay, and updated graphics for those picky, silly people who think it looks like a poke in the eye. Historical database and campaigns? Might as well not do your history homework, heh, heh. It worked for me several times. That aside, custom campaign creator, scenario editor? Extremely versatile, you can create anything medieval or fantasy that you desire. Look for the developers/beta mod thing, it expands your perimeters. I'll bet that this game would be in the top 100 if:  1) More people knew about it 2) It was cheaper ($10-$15 should do the trick, Steam) Yes, this game IS THE BEST! Knights, castles, kings, and penguins? AWESOME! Don your morion, mount your horse, and ride forward! To battle (and potential peace)! You'd have to be crazy not to get this!"
The best HD remake ever make! 10/10
"This isn't just wololo, this is wololo... IN HIGH DEFINITION !"
"I used to play this game as a kid, I picked it up during the summer sale. I'm so happy to be playing this again. AOE is a classic RTS. Get it."
Brings back good memories and still as awesome as ever. I wish they didn't change all the hotkeys though..
"Previously played this game to death and absolutely loved it.  The HD version doesn't really provide anything more than the original did and is ultimatley a cash in on a great game with some minor graphic improvements.  Having said that, if you dont have a copy of the original i would certainly recommend this game although i would be inclined to buy it in a sale!  As with a lot of older games the AI can be suspect at time and downright stupid at others and, with all these style games, the harder difficulties dont mean the AI is better tactically it simply gathers resources and builds faster than it is possible for a player to do!  All in all this is a classic well worth some time."
great game but bad dlc
"This is Age of Empires 2, longbowmen are nerfed"
"As someone who played the original game a lot, I sincerely recommend reccomend the HD version, even if only for the ability to play easy multiplayer with friends after years of the original multiplayer not working very well. The rest of the game is almost exactly how I remember it, which is great."
Buy the game so you can play it with me Need people to boost ELO off
"Inspired move to revisit a timeless classic and just fix it for the moden generation. More games need this! Looking at you, EA (generals/RA)."
"This game got just what it needed a HD remake and teamed up with Steam workshop, great work on this one!"
Spent over £800 on new computer and still playing a game which is 16 years old. Top game
I like this game because I can convert buildings to Christianity and that always helps.
Best strategy game there is.
"the best of all the age of empires games and a must have for anyone who loves real time stratergy.  it was a masterpiece back in the day. in conclusion GET THE GAME dont even wait for a sale this hd upgrade brings back better ai and better visuals and some more minor changes, even if you have already sunk endless hours into the original you wont find big changes in this version but who cares this is one of the best stratergy games ever. You get to learn and have fun at the same time."
"If your ever in a pinch, send a sheep on a scouting mission"
Fantastic to have this game on Steam! My only critisism is why are we still waiting for the mac version?
Teutonic Knights. 'Nuff said. 10/10
aoe 3 is better tho
Amazing game; one of my favorites
"Awesome, I used to play this when I was younger and i loved it and now its in HD"
Extremely addictive strategy game!!
Very fun and very addictive. There's nothing quite like decimating another team with your friends :D
"One of the quintessential, must-have games of the RTS genre.   11/10 would spam petards again"
Very sexy
One of my first PC games. Fun to play with friends. And tons of mods for graphics and stuff. Grab it on a sale for nostalgic gameplay.
"Amazing, one of the best RTS you will ever play. Very realistic. "
old but gold. The first game I played when I was a kid
Best game of the 21st century. 11/10 made my childhood not ♥♥♥♥
Good game from the late 90's. Makes me feel like I'm on Windows 98 again. BSOD.
One of the best games ever!
Punched a castle until it caught fire. 10/200 b/c the huns
This is a semi-historic Strategy game with multiple different ways to play the game both as a single player or in a multi-player mode. I think the HD graphics are an improvement. I like the upgrade/research options and the different difficulty options for the AI in this game.
Classic game that does not lose its greatness no matter how much time goes by. Always a blast to play.
super fun! I just wish it was cross platform.
"Classic RTS game from my childhood. The single player campaign is extensive, taking me all of about 90+ hours to complete. Lots of different empires to play as, all with their respective unique units and bonuses, all while being incredibly balanced to play as. The multiplayer is also lots of fun if you got some friends to play with.  My only complaints is that sometimes the AI can get a little stupid. I had one instance where and allied CPU built about 80 mining camps all over the place for no reason. Also, the multiplayer can be a pain in the butt to run smooth sometimes and it took a lot of searching to get clear answers on how to fix it.   This game aged wonderfully and while it misses a lot of bells and whistles and fancy stuff that modern RTS games have nowadays, it's still an amazing game to play."
"All the greatness i remember as a kid, while still being worth while running on a screen that isnt thicker than it is wide"
This game was my childhood. Everytime I start the game up I get the feels.
I want the sheep with the blue collar :)
...
"Back to my childhood !  just Awesome ,,, nothing more to say"
pretty awesome for its age. highly recommend
" FREAKIN' BEST GAME EVER   Best played with friends for maximum joy (and arrogance if you beat them by  Ages ) &lt;&lt; see what I did there Gameplay = 10/10 Graphics = I can't decide since Age of Empires was released a few years back, but depending to the gameplay, I say it's a 10/10 (from the year it was created)   HD MY A$$ THO  XD"
Fun game to play with friends
"Well, its age of empires 2 with better graphics. A legend in gaming and still going strong :)"
I've played this game since the early 2000s. This is still one of my favorite PC games of all time.
"Great game but massive lag on multiplayer mode, seems to have been like this since they released the game and no fix to it as of yet."
"Age of Empires II is a fun RTS game, that has excellent story line campaigns. There are many stories and plenty of fun to be had. The maps have plenty of resources on them, but not enough for one of the teams to be too strong. Maps are well balanced and refreshing. I love the little extra challenge in the beginning to mid game with wild animals harassing your expanding empire. The research is fun with plenty of ways to develop your nation technology wise. I also like the variety of building models which accompany the people you can play as. It's the small things that I enjoy the most about this game. The voices of the characters and the people's languages that they use. The controls are good and the pathfinding of the units are decent. I would suggest this game to any of my friends, so I can engulf them."
"brilliant game not to be overplayed, best of the Age- games. dont overplay or listen to metacritic review"
Good hd version of my old favourite game from years ago...
Still one of the best games ever made!
"The game itself I played initially upon release and loved it just like all of the Age series (AOE3 my least favorite though). I got the HD rerelease here on steam and dove in and loved it just as much if not more due to the improved graphics. Great game and I actually think I like it a little more than AoM sometimes which is my favorite Age game.  I'd love to see another expansion pack or HD remake though, one that covers Rome Greece Egypt and Mesopotamian cultures. Vanilla Age of Empires as a HD edition would be cool."
"Solid remaster. Good for nostalgia, stands the test of time decently, runs well. The biggest flaws are the AI and the pathing. Unit behavior can be very frustrating to control. The computers always cheat."
Perfect for LAN-parties
Incredible and fun and addictive game been playing for years still have my cd rom editiions too lol 5/5
"Returning now, is a game in which I have enjoyed when I was 6 and 7 years old. Unfortunately, that fun was cut short when I accidentally broke the disk. But now in 2013, I am able to recreate the same fun I had as a wee boy. Even though it’s true that the developers and publishers are profiting of Nostalgia ♥♥♥♥ like me, I would rather thank them than damn them.  With many single player campaign missions, 8 player multiplayer games, different game modes, plenty of factions to choose from, steam workshop and custom scenarios, it is obvious that there is hours upon hours of fun to be had, as long as you have a friends to play with of course.  It’s fun, you totally should buy it, so says I.  "
This is one of the best games ever.Just buy it! you wont get bored for a long time.
"Age of Empires II is my favourite game of all time. The HD edition only makes it better,"
Brillant even after all this time
"dont buy it if you havent played the original age of empires 2 exept you dont care about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and the retro styled theme in general.If you have played the original then of course you must! its a classic,and an awesome game that people still play after all those years. Its addicting and still really fun! I havent fount any disadvantage. The only thing that can be counted as an disadvantage is multiplayer which can be very laggy sometimes but probably its just my internet :) Of course i recommend it"
"Now I know you might be complaining about the bugs in multiplayer, the crashes, and whatever else. BUT. I would like to point out, all the 10 year olds you were playing against growing up when the game originally came out? They're grown up. And why in the world would any new 10 year olds start playing now when there are so many other newer options? Zero kids now. Checkmate.  **Wololo** get this game."
Yeh it's pretty good aye
I really would like to play this on my Mac. :'(
"A fantastic reviving of a classic game. Age of Empires 2 HD brings back all of the nostalgia of playing this game when I was 12, with the added bonus and making me realise once more just how awesome this game is. To this day I lament that the Age of Empires series was cancelled before we got 4 and 5."
"This was great for nostalgia's sake. If you have played the original, it's the same game with a higher population cap, some bugs fixed, and prettier graphics.  If you haven't played AOE2, expect a classic RTS with race specific technology trees. This was one of the first RTS games i can remember where swarming an enemy could be countered using real tactics.  it's a classic, and it's worth revisiting if you can catch it on sale."
Loooove this game!
A great revamp of a classic RTS. Community Mods help take this to the next level in terms of civilization balancing. Definitely recommended as the AOE game to play of all in the series.
Grew up on this game and played it way more than I should have. It never gets old and the community is still alive and well.
A timeless classic RTS game. Highly recomended.
this game never gets old people should tottalyget this 10/10
"The hours shown above do not reflect the true amount of time I have spent playing this game (because I have spent much more playing it as a kid). AoE SPILLS nostalgia from my childhood and brings it all back in HD!! Needless to say this is my all-time favorite RTS. With the new upgraded graphics and additional civilizations, it's just too much fun. If you're into building massive armies or micromanaging individual units to pester your enemies, building great walls to defend/claim your area, or battling at sea (optional), THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!! #multiplayer"
Just have to love it.
It's Age of Empires II.... what more do you need to know?
"If you are not to sure on what this game is WELL THEN STOP AND LISTEN!  Age of empires II is one of the funnest games i have played, it is a stratagy game made to make you think while also having a blast :D you build you empire to a race to dominate others enimies playing. If you are looking for a new game This is it!!!  SOOOOO worth it :D"
"I've had a few copies of AOE2 + Conquerers over the years. The CD's have often got destroyed and new ones bought again. I used to play this game for hours. The Steam version of the game has fixed a few things that were broken originally. All of the network play used to be a nightmare to get going. This is fixed now and integrated to work with your friends list. The Steam workshop lets you customize the look of the game by downloading small mods, maps, music packs etc. The game resolution has been upped majorly and looks less pixelated then it is in the original by alot.  The only drawback for me with this game is the LAN feature. This is non existant and often I would play AOE in LANS. Despite the game being fantastic and made shinier not having the LAN feature blemishes things a bit. Currently if I wish to play with my siblings in the next room, it's played through the Steam network and not locally. Which means we can lag despite the short distance betwen us.  If you enjoyed the original. This game is exactly the same, shinier, would recommend it to vets looking for a digital copy.  Just don't expect any LAN play."
"It's a good game, a classic. BUT, in my heart, Age of Mythology will forever be better. Anyone with me? Anyone? :P"
"This game has long been a childhood favorite. It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC. I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite. For those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one. A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community."
A classic ROTS that I gleefully purchased in HD. Worth it just because I know I'll always have a little nostalgia to play on Steam.
Awesome reboot of an awesome game! Extremely fun with friends.
Heart.
"This game is excellent;however, if you ever have a technical problem like i am having (game wont launch regardless of remedy) dont expect any help from 'Steam' or 'Valve' or any other stupid name they come up with on this platform. Technical support is non-existant and they will gladly take your money but they wont maintain your product if you have an issue. Many people on the forums report an issue with launching the game and the remedy that they post (which helps many people) doesnt work for my pc running Windows XP. Ive had the game for about a year and had this problem for about 2 weeks now. Would seriously like to get help for this and if not a full refund"
Bought the game as part of the package deal with the base game. Looks like the auto download only installed the expansion pack but not the base game. So the game won't run when I click on the PLAY button on the game's start-up page. The start-up page disappears and nothing happens.  This sucks!!!
The best itme you can have playing and old school strategy game. super simple to learn but tames lots of time to become a true legend. play this all the time!!!
Amazing game. Tons of fun and the DLC is pretty great too. Pick it up on sale for sure!
Really loved this classic game! Very Nostalgic
"This game and Age of Mythology were basically my entire childhood, they were what I would be playing at most times of the day so now to be able replay a remastered edition with added elements and a workshop to be able to add to this already fantastic game, its like reliving my childhood all over again"
Favorite game of all time. Still have the original disks and I must have put a 1000 hours into AOEII as a kid. Having it on Steam with NEW content is a dream come true.
"Age of Empires 2 HD Edition........  Why are you evening looking at the reviews, buy the god damn game!"
"Awesome RTS game, lost many hours...days...of life playing this game over the years."
"Gr8 game, I think i can lead australia better than abbeeetttt now~"
This game reinforces the stereotype that medieval people had a 10 minute average life expectancy.
Would give this game a 11/10 if you HAVE FRIENDS if not go home
"Excatly as I remember it, sans issues that I had when playing it on Vista on up."
really good 1v1 me my army vs urs
Great game! Started playing it whe i was 11. Now 14 Years later still exited to play it. :D
Our team is winning the game!    teammate: 'Let built a wonder!' me: *facepalm*  worst game ever 10/10
"Age of Empires 2 always had a special place with me. I love history, and this game plays out history with strategy into one beautifully made game that still stands the test of time. The HD version basically makes the game much crispier and brighter. I also have the Forgotten expansion pack, which add several new scenarios in addition to the scenarios you currently have. It's a fun game, definately get this!"
"This is a great game. Even thought it is many years old, it is never boring to play. It's a great game to play with friends and family."
"if you played this before, this game is for you"
"Good old Age of Empires, back on our screens, the good old game with the good old bugs, and a few new ones, a good thing is the workshop support that includes a lot of nice and new content."
an old gem brought back to life for you and yuor friends to have fun and raid and pillage lands. Only drawback is the lan feature being taken out by steam. so expect to have some lag between you and your friend sitting in the same room as you. overall nice time filler game.
"This game is terrible for multiplayer, especially if you have a friend on digiweb. The game constantly freezes and then it is not recoverable and you get rekt and waste 3 hours of your time still recommend"
"Wololo! I love this game. First played it when I was twelve, and was very happy to start playing it again just recently."
"If you liked the old AOE you'll like this. It's not that changed. Multiplayer is nice. Compatibility with new computers is nice. Price sucks for a game thats still basically 16 years old though - its a great game, but $20 hurts - especially if you want to do in-house multiplayer, since with steam you'd have to buy an extra copy for each computer. I got it on the christmas sale so it was like 12 for this and the expansion.  Tl;dr: If you liked the old one, wait for a sale and get this. Don't get the expanison, it hardly adds anything and almost nobody ever plays on the multiplayer for the expanison."
"After growing up playing this game, it feels good seeing that Microsoft still cares about this. The HD remake is not perfect, but still it's fun to play the game again with higher res and textures.  Still need to get more time to invest in this."
Good. Despite the lag from starting up a multiplayer game it's the same as the original game.
Thumbs up for we want Age of Empires 1 HD remake. Also this is great classic remade with HD textures and lots of nice features including new civs and units. This and Age of Empires 1 is where my gaming started all those years ago.
"Absolutely funtastic, AOE 2 classic RTS!!! nostalgic"
"I have enjoyed playing this game, and I just started! I'm recording for my channel, but I couldn't help playing off camera since there is so much to explore and learn about. I feel like I'm back in history being each character! I would highly recommend this if you like a clean, easy to play, strategic game."
"Good as it was new, still loving this game. Great to have the multiplayer working."
"The only 'Age of' anything worth buying. It's simple enough to get a hold of quickly, and the has enough content to keep you playing for hours on end. Don't forget it's also got multiplayer and steamworkshop."
Great game. Played it a lot in college and bought it here a few weeks ago and can't stop playing it now. Great stategy game that keeps you entertained.
"While the HD release doesn't add anything really to the gameplay or the look of the game for that matter, it's still a solid play if you like the original and don't have it anymore."
Just perfect! Back to the good old times fitting right in my new screen! Own online hosted games included via Steam!
I've never told my friends 'i will bring death upon your people and leave a burning trail of ash and despair' and ment it
I love it the multiplayer works great and it also come with the conquerors expansion already unlike the actual cd-rom game. And you can choose to play co-op which is a great new feauture.
"Easy to have fun, damn hard to be good against solid AI or online. A great RTS with great inter-civilization parity. The best player wins and 'best' tends to be he with the most ability use the force of ADD for good as there is so much to focus on."
"One of the best strategy games ever, simply. Not much to say if you've played the original version, it's the same with better graphics. period. I would advise the 'The Forgotten' expansion if you can get it for cheap (0.70£ the other day)."
Converted an elephant and a building. 10/10
"First game ever played, lost the disc ages ago but Steam to the rescue."
A classic... I only wish there were more techs and battle units. Sometimes the simplicity of the game is to simple. 4.5/5
"First of all Add me as a friend: Remy7_7  I think that this game has to be one of the best games in the world.  I played this game when i was a kid about 7 years old (14 years old now), this is the game that made me play many other games and the first game i played on an electronic device.  It all started when i was a kid with a very boring life, and then all of a sudden my uncle gets this game with a pc for me on christmas. I have never experienced a game better than this before. I do not like 2D games that much but this game is exceptional. After we had to move to another country, i lost my pc including the game. Throughout the years i have been searching for this game everywhere. I have finally found this game and never felt happier. I played this game about 9 hours a day (this is the first day).   It may look stupid and boring, but once you buy it and play. YOU WILL NOT STOP!!!!!  I love this game, it brings back many memories.  Games that bring back memories and are top on my list: Age of Empires, Call of Duty Black ops 2, Tomb Raider, Army of Zin.  I reccomend this game because i know that everyone would love it!!"
"Loaded up the game... chose a civilization, trying to figure out what to do besides building houses... built a mining and lumberjack thing and started mining/cutting wood. 5 minutes later I was ready to go to the Feudal Age and then I got raided by the enemy. 11/10 would play again (but not on a difficult level to begin with :3) :D"
Old but still perfect strategy to play :)
"Age of Empires II HD is one of those games where you forget how much time has passed playing it because it keeps you pretty hooked. It's very fun learning the different strategies, and it does a good deal for the RTS Genre in my opinion. All the civilizations have access to very similar units, with the exception of each civ's one or two Unique units.   The unit tactics are pretty straightforward, with each unit gaining an attack bonus vs other units (for example, Spearmen Infantry do bonus damage to Cavalry and mounted units), but besides the general units, there are other tactics to be used, like sending light cavalry to disrupt the enemy economy, placing archers behind walls/lines of infantry, etc.  Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who likes RTS games, as long as you aren't picky about 3D graphics. It will give you hours of fun, especially if you have a friend or three to play with or against. Definitely worth the price, I actually bought my brother a copy during the winter sale."
"One of the best old school games regardless to the nostalgia it brings, HD my ♥♥♥♥ though, it looks the exact same."
if any one wants to play mp with me i m here great game
"Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ wont work. Multiplayer lags like hell. They wont fix it. Pls microsoft, dont puplish this ♥♥♥♥ with HD label and take 20€from a game that doesnt work. peec"
This is AoE 2 as you remember it. Amazing!
Excellent game! Used to play this one when i was little! Its exactly how i remembered!
An old classic I used to play and still love.
"brilliant game, endless hours of fun"
"This game definitely brings back memories, plus, I am amazed that they came out with an expansion pack 14 YEARS after it was released. It's a really great RTS game, and even with paying full Steam price, it's worth it. I have yet to actually play any expansion content, but I'm sure it'll be just as great as the base game."
"Age of Empires 2 is a very good game, but Age of Empires 2 HD Edition is even better! =D"
"All the classic AOE but with a beastly upgrade in population size, map size and civilization variety. Nothing incredibly noticeable with the graphics in my opinion and the game lags when first played however each time you play it, it runs smoother.... had some issues with multiplayer (LAN) handling the amount of troops being thrown around in a 3 player game.    Besides for a few minor bugs I was very very happy with the game!"
better than starcraft
Nice little throwback to the childhood days.
great game
"this game... well, its one of the first games I played, well... ever, on the PS2 mind you, so when I came to see this game on steam, I wanted a taste of good old fashioned nostalgia. I bloody hell did I get that by playing the well made tutorial (which was after all, all I played on the ps2 version). but now I play some multiplayer against some friends, and bloody hell aren't there some laughs to be had. I even made a friend choke by shouting, 'DAH' in a dramatic way, meanwhile I'm pointing out my MASSIVE naval strike force going off to obliterate the enemy. He has got me back for that several times since however. anyway, the controls are simple and easy, but games can take up to 5 hours, so if you're gonna play with friends, make sure you start at 12, because if the game is set in the correct way, you'll end up either spending those five hours trying to out think your friends or help them destroy the final enemy building, but when you screw up... defeat can be slow and so much so that it is almost torture, however that does allow you to escape and set up elsewhere. but I still say this game's playability is... quite remarkable, fun till the end, and an incredible mind game, a test of your strategical prowess and skill."
I would recommend this game to hard core fans of strategy games because for me this is too hard too play. theres moderate mode but not easy. other than that excellent game
"Excelent game, It brings to me good memories, I dont see the 'HD', but that's no problem."
steps to win:  1. play huns 2. win
"Back in the past, I actually had a thing for playing real-time strategy games like this one.  Now that it's the present, what better way to bring some of those memories back than the ability to play Age of Empires II in widescreen resolutions? I had fun with it in the past, and I bet you'll have as much fun as I had, too."
Got some friends? Got a few (or several) hours to spare for one game? Want a brilliant strategy game that still is good today?  BUY Age of Empires II Today!  Warning: Age of Empires will not be held responsible for ruining friendships if bullsh*t occurs.
"Grade A huge classic, I would recommend anyone who likes RTS's to play AOE. the second one was the best of all 3. from the base development to the fighting, it's still all round fun, years later :3"
Anawesome game that brings back memories remastered and better than ever...
"Best RTS ever made, that is enough said, you must buy it! :)"
My villager moonwalks.  'Nough said.
I CAN NOT GET IT TO PLAY!!!!!!!!!
"One of my all time favourites, grew up playing this game and wow did i enjoy every moment :D"
"One of my favorite games of all time. Simple, yet it has the emergent property of being a very good strategy game!"
One of my favorite games ever played in my childhood :)
"Countless hours spent on AoE2 nonHD.  Unit pathing is bit clumsier as it was in noHD version making it hard to control large armies sometimes, but yet this is classic. must have it.  9/10"
Got killed 10/10 would fap again
can't change game resolution in game or outside of game in the advanced options
Great. And Very Memorialable Game!
"This game is a staple of the RTS genre. Whether you are new to style or a seasoned veteran, AOE II has something to offer. The gameplay learning curve is relatively small. They have recently remapped the Hotkeys to be more intuitive. Developers are constantly working to balance and improve the game. As a long time fan of the original, the added bonuses of Steam multiplayer hosting and new expansions are wonderful. This game is worth every penny (and hour) you spend on it!"
"I may be biased based on my nostalgia from this game, but it's a really solid RTS."
Enjoyed that the calssic game has been remastered all into one game. The expansion and everything. The new expansion is a lot of fun. I am able to play with my brothers across the United States like old times!
"From time to time I catch myself wondering to play it again. It won't satisfy me forever, but it's sandind still..."
Great strategy game
"It took me a while to pick this up and I really don't regret it. It's still the great game we all know and love, though it honestly doesn't look much better than it did all those years ago. Really quick and easy to make and join multiplayer games. Steam Workshop is bursting with dope ♥♥♥♥ to download and try out.  From my limited play so far the only thing I've noticed is the increased population cap (500) and missing LAN capabilities (dang).  If you're one of those people who still pops in the disc to play every now and then, then this remake is definitely worth your time and money. It takes me back to when you had to play on the ZONE (GOD DAMN what was that like 100 years ago or something?)."
It's an old Classic remade into a new medium. Nothing more to be said.
"Worth it, still fun after all these years"
"My playtime of this game is much higher than Steam shows, I've been playing since I got the CD in a cereal box years ago.  A classic. Brings back memories of lan parties far gone. Online play integrates well with Steam."
Now with super kawaii~~~ graphics!!!
"I loved AOE2 to death, and love AOE2HD to death as well. It is basically the same game except for the fact that it has online multiplayer, a higher pop cap, interestingly higher quality water textures(I think. I'm not sure if the water was taken from AOE3, it is a unique texture, or just the same-old same-old), and an online community. I love it so much because I don't need to do LAN parties like I used to. All the bugs from the old game are still there, and then some, but other than that, it's still a lovely game to play! If you are an old AOE2 fan, an AOE3 fan, aan RTS fan, or just new to the series, AOE2HD is a great game that you ought to get.   Some of the gripes I have with it, however, are that some derpy things still happen. For example, in the scenario editor I was making a map to try out my new AI, and it involved exploring, finding base camps, and using those base camps to build up armies, get more bases, and kill your foes. I used GAIA for the base camps, and, as you may well know, AIs can't convert units on their own. I got around that by placing triggers around each base camp so the AI can convert their units. As soon as my units were about to meet the AIs units in battle, some of their units and their little base converted, because they still had the properties of GAIA! how derpy! They should fix this problem. I'm pretty sure it's easy, too, like add a defrule that says if this unit converts via trigger, it cannot convert again. But I got the map to work out in the end by scrapping the idea of the conversion and all was happy. There are a couple of other bugs with it too, but as I have said before, this is still a great game."
"Amazing game, fun with family, friends and yurmom.  created a multitude of expireces that i will never forget Thank you for game Gaben, plz gib luck. Gmen."
"AoE was one of my favourite childhood games. The problem is that it's aged quite bad. Don't misunderstand me the port is good and worth the price. The problem is that today this game is just... not so fun.   Worth a try if you're completely new to the AoE series, otherwise look for something a little more 'fresh'  yes...with a but."
Wood please.
"Only on sale, nothing new in the game"
"The game that started it all,one of the best rts games ever made iif you like rts games this is a must have the HD vershon is worth re buying the game"
I have played this game countless hours when it first came out and it became my gold standard for this kind of game.  The epic fights were too numerous to count as well. I recently purchased it on Steam and I am planning on getting a new generation of players on the fun - if they can survive my unstoppable armies! :)
"AoE 2 is in my opinion, the best out of the series. Best buy I have, played it since I was 12 and still enjoy it and the history it has; awesome game."
if any one wants to play mp with me i m here great game
"Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ wont work. Multiplayer lags like hell. They wont fix it. Pls microsoft, dont puplish this ♥♥♥♥ with HD label and take 20€from a game that doesnt work. peec"
This is AoE 2 as you remember it. Amazing!
A true and still amazing classic!
"I've played it long ago, but its still cool."
Is Gud
Possibly one of my most favourite games of all time.
Don't you mean the 'Age of Bizarro II HD Edition'?
"I have played many, many more hours of this game than this steam thing says I have due to offline mode playing.   This is the most fun game that I have. I have AoE III and this game is WAY better. Used to love playing Warcraft 3 but this game allows you to build a much larger army for more epic battles. It is so much fun to play with your friends, I got it on sale and ended up buying it for 3 of my friends/wife for only a few bucks each and have had so much fun with it.  Best RTS game I have ever played. If you love RTS then this is essential. This game and then Rise of Nations."
1 of the best ecoch living Real TIME LIFE of our ages truely and extroardinary masterpiece of civilisation building and war time militarisation strategy tactiction game i have ever known (grew up with the game) love it... get it... 9.5/10
A must play classic
"This is truely bringing back the old classic with style! The multiplayer doesn't work very well, which is the only downfall. But its great because you can mod the textures (I even made a Minecraft texture pack for it!) Overall, good job on bringing this classic to Steam!"
Amazing game. Been playing for almost 10 years now.
"Despite the 'HD' rebranding; same great game from your childhood, just revamped for Steam with supported online play. Steam achievements and trading cards if you're into that. Add to wishlist and wait for sale. For $3 I have no complaits about this classic game."
its a fun game but they make the prices way toi high i would only buy it if its on sale 
Great re-release of a great game!
Played as the turks and converted petards to islam ALLAHU AKBAR/10
"A good revival to a great game, unfortunatly multiplayer games are too laggy and often desync before games can be finished. Do not buy unless you only enjoy single player gameplay."
Best genocide simulator I've ever played.
"This game is pretty fun! It can get abit competitive when playing with friends. Love the simulation aspect of the game but I'm not a big fan of the ingame quests, I just stick with the multi-player mode."
"It's great being able to revisit a childhood favorite. Fairly good remaster, though there's not a lot of remastery. Great fun regardless, just don't expect eye candy."
this game is so much fun if you dont have get it
"Some games don't get old and this is one of them. The mechanics haven't been reimagined in anyway, the engine has just been updated a little so it doesn't look wrong on systems newer than 2003.  TL;DR - it's the same game you know and love."
It's age of empires 2... What else is there to say
"Man, this game has an awesome developer team. One of the best reboots, plus, it's good ol' Age of Empires II, I mean, how bad can that go wrong?"
This game is really expensive
no doses not work on my high end pc
"This game is gucci, but the community is cancer"
It's AoE2 minus the reolution probably that new windows brings! Worth it a lone!
"Age of Empires 2 is a must have if you even think you want to try any RTS. I haven't played the third but between youtube videos and trailers for the game, it doesn't look as fun. Age of Empires 2 may be a little tough to get the hang of but once you have all the basics down, its hard to stop playing. I had the original AoE 2 and the HD edition is the exact same with extra content in the form of DLC. The only diffence is the graphics which honestly isn't a noticable difference. However, with the new steam workshop integration and creative mod makers, the game's graphics can be heavily improved with the simple click of a button. There is a lot of positive stuff I could just ramble on about but instead I'm just gonna say that unless Age of Empires 2 HD is in your steam library you can't say you own a fun game"
"Its a classic in HD with 500 of population to make all the units you want, the perfection made videogame."
Good hd remake of a great game
What better way to put people in their place than by introducing a large amount of foreign metal into their bodies?
"Im going to keep this one simple,  1) If you played it before .... your love it 2) If you have not ...... your love it 3) If you like RTS games ..... your love it 4) If you hate RTS games ..... your love it  Also the new HD graphics make a nice touch on a cult classic.  Still a few minor bugs but nothing major.  9/10"
"I love this game, but there's one thing I don't like about it. The computer AI advance to ages ahead of you if you're too busy building or creating villagers. Otherwise, a good game."
"No word required, the legend of strategy games (y)"
"Oh well, wolololo, and land in sight"
Played this game since I was 7 years old and I never dropped it since. Fantastic RTS that is really consistant as shown with it's age. Great to see that it is still worked on and played by a great community.
"Nothing more than a slightly graphically updated game.  Still addicting as hell, and just as fun as I remember. Community's pretty solid as well even after all these years, as opposed to other games from its generation."
"One of the first games I've played, enjoyable. HD version is even better."
"What can I say? It's Age of Empires brought back into the modern world! For any long-time AOE fans, this is a must. For anyone who hasn't played AOE... WHY?? This is one of the most popular and least intimidating old-school RTS series. Fun and challenging campaigns, map editor built-in to make custom scenarios, fully scriptable AI behavior for your custom scenarios, infinitely re-playable custom skirmish matches, and oh yeah - voice taunts!! What more could you want?"
"I don't know how many hours, or better let us speak of days, I've spent on this game, when I was young. Some time ago it was re-released in HD with a small amount of additional features and a friend gifted it to me, since the price of 18€ was a bit to high for my taste; I mean, I already had the original, why do you want me to pay 18€ for a game almost 15 years old, which I do own already. Anyway, if you do not own this masterpiece of Real-Time-Strategy yet, go and buy it. One of the best games ever, you won't regret it, if you do like true RTS, there is no way around Age of Empires."
"All the memmories about the original come to live again.  Basically it is the old game with better graphics, so there are some small issues wiht the pathfinding and some performance losses when there are vast quantities of unit on the field, but the game is still awesome, and the price is fair."
"Perfect reboot of a classic RTS. Game runs well, plays well and the multiplayer works perfectly.  "
Age of empires. Need i say more.
十年经典，一续旧情。  now is 11:00pmi just wonna play 1more and go to bed ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... OH! its 6:00am now!
"Overall it's a lot like the orginal, it plays very well and with some of the AI tweaks it could be better single player than the orignal one was, if you like playing it back when it came out then you will most likely really enjoy this game and the expansion is really worth getting onsale as well. There are some downsides, with the larger population sizes and the natures of online play the game can slow to a crawl and thats with low ping times, if you have high ping times which will often happen the game can just chugg along at some points. The only thing that is really just a travesty is that there is no lan support, that would make this game such a better deal. I'm not sure it's worth the full $20 but onsale it usually is like $5-8 and at that price it's totally worth it if you're a fan of RTS games evn if all you end up doing is playing the single player."
This game is still a must have even after all these years. 
This game is the best thing that ever happened to humanity.
Wololo
"As someone who played this awesome game the first time around, it's even better in HD. Loved it then, LOVING it NOW!"
A solid and fun remake of the originals I find very good hours and hours of game play. Awesome!
My childhood... in widescren
"Graphics are always at the forefront of PC gaming in the present time we are in. I will offer this one bit of advice: if you can play for 6 hours straight at a minimum and feel like only 1 has passed you will be aware the graphics in this game are not an issue. A classic game, which anyone can play."
Remake at its best. Loving it.
"If you like real time strategy, you can't have missed this game. If you like medieval stuff, you can't have missed this game.  Even after all these years, this game is still fantastic. I think no other real time strategy game has achieved what AOE2 has.  The graphic is still fine, the mechanics are ok, the fatcions diversity is there and the game overall is kinda balanced.  Also the AI has enough difficulty levels to be challenging for almost everyone.    The votes  Graphic: 7/10 today, 9.5/10 when it came out Campaings: 8/10 today, 9.5/10 when it came out Civilizations: 8/10 today, 9.5/10 when it came out Mechanics: 7.5/10 today, 10/10 when it came out AI: 10/10 Longevity: 10/10, still enjoyable after 14 years. Expansions: The Conquerors 10/10, The Forgotten 6/10  Overall: 8/10 today, 15/10 in 2001"
"Unlimited replayability, great multiplayer game with friends.  The devs are still doing updates periodically for this 15 year old game, that shows how amazing it is."
The best real time strategy game I have ever played. You can spend hours building up your army or be destroyed in 20 minutes of the game starting. Endless hours of enjoyment. Been playing this game for 10+ years
"i can't play it i played the old one and it was great but i cant play this one only the launcher comes up and when i click play it just gets rid of the launcher and does not open the game... waste of time and money so far.  if there is a way to fix this i will listen, but i tried every thing and it wont work."
"There are two sorts of people who are reading this review: Those who played AoE and those who have not.  For the first: This HD edition keeps most of the retro charm of AoE with few changes to gameplay, none of which are major. Some of the individual graphics such as water and trees have been modernised but overall there are no changes. You can't go wrong with this, buy it.  For the second: If you play strategy games then this is a real classic and you should have played it on one level or another. If you do not then this is a good one to start with. There is a good learning campaign which teaches you the basics and, with only 4 resources and population to handle, this game lacks the 'fat' of later strategy games."
"This is a classic! It' even in HD!! Holy ♥♥♥♥ they remade the fire and the water. New ♥♥♥♥ing water and fire!!! That right! That should be reason enough to buy this game! Not convinced!? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, I ain't in the business of convincing. A/10"
"100/10 - I lived in my old house for about 7 years. I was big on Age of Empires II and sorta III. So just about every day after school for those 5 years(not completely sure how long BUT A LONG TIME) I would get on my Computer and play AOE II for hours! I loved that game. When I got this game a couple days ago I knew I was going to love it and play it all the time, also I got it on the sale so it was only like 2 or maybe 3 dollars! WITH HD AND EXPANSION.  I would recommend this game to anyone who love-well, I recommend it for EVERYONE! Even though it is no longer on sale it is still worth it!!"
Simply this game is RTS perfection it introduced me to the genre and i cant help but come back to it. To say that any game invented a rave for a genre is hard to do but this one managed to do it.
spamming '30' in the lobby chat as the game counts down to start is worth the money this game costs alone
I loved this game since it was gifted to me in like 01. Remeber playing battles custom made just to watch to slaughters. Recommended.
Great game!
This game is really good. It teaches you certain facts about Empires and stuff.  5 stars
"A blast to the past. Brings back this masterpiece without OS problems. Has all the things that made it great in the past, including The Conquerors and The Forgotten.  Does have some multiplayer lag issues. (won't always work with all friends)"
"I wish I could add the hours and hours I played this during my childhood to my Steam playtime counter. The best RTS I have ever played. Age of Empires II was my favorite of the whole series. Fantastic variety and an excellent game to play with friends! Could not recommend more, especially if it's on sale!"
"Perfect old favourite, with fancy graphics fit to be present in castles of parfumed high lords and ladies. "
"Good strategy game, graphics are a little outdated now but don’t let that get in the way. The map builder allows for the creation of different scenarios resulting in a different experience each time."
"If you have some money &gt;&gt; BUYS THIS GAME &lt;&lt; This is the best strategie game ever ! - a lots of player / lobby - Awesome game play - Steam Workshop - Awesome custom map  9,5 / 10"
great game brings back lots of memories would recomend if you have play AoE3 or AoE1 or any other large stratergy game
"This game is really good if you have friends to play it with it has many races but it gets boring playing against BOTs , but it is a very good game that gives you a feeling of acomplishment when you burn down a town by hitting buildings with swords 10 / 10."
7.8/109
feeling nostalgic.. feeling nostalgic everywhere... 10+ years since i last played this game and its still awesome
One of the very first and a classic RTS
"Great game, but this is HD?  Just seems to be higher resolution, maybe? But a Mod exists already that allow the user higher resolution, I believe. And now the option of a Local Area Network is removed for Steam's multiplayer server.  When you think 'HD edition' of old games you hope they have juiced up the graphics a bit. But they are exactly the same, apart from the water has ripples, which the ships don't affect, and the fire looks more vibrate, which was such a needless change and looks more cartoonish next to the rest of the graphics. Supposedly you can get add-ons or extras, (whatever steam calls it), but I tried one couldn't get it to work so far, plus you have to hunt them out.  What would've been better is if they increased the frame rate of the animations and made the trees, terrain and buildings look less low-res bitmappy. Then it would be somewhat worth the £14.99 original asking price. However I bought it whilst it was £2.29, which is cheaper than buying it on amazon, so I can't complain, but you would be a fool to buy it for £14.99 for such an old game.  But if you really want this as multiplayer and have no friends to play on a LAN, then BUY all means."
"Very fun, always loved this series!"
Glad to find another old classic revamped. This is one of the first games I can remember playing on the PC and I still love it.
"One of the best games of all time. Spent several hours when I was a kid playing it. Wether it was campaigns or multiplayer through the MSN Zone. It is great to see they brought it up to date, but I believe they could've done a bit better (graphics-wise). Playability is just as good as always. Definitely a great purchase, particularly during the summer sale :)"
"I played over 500 hours on Age of Empires II when it came out. This review is for the HD version. +The graphics aren't too different... but the water looks good. +Multiplayer is full of players +Map Editor is friendly to new players +A lot of campaigns +People can easily upload maps and mods to the Steam Workshop +Good skirmishes, especially if playing with friends +Good tutorial, teaches new players about the game +A lot of history can be learned from this game -You have to pay for the forgotten DLC, which has a few more campaigns -Cheats can easily ruin a game, unless disabled by the host... but nothing stops you from using cheats on singleplayer. -Objectives are hard to find, you must explore the map to find the path.  Score: 9.5/10. You shouldn't pay for DLCs you already have.  Good game, for new players and veteran players alike.  "
Its Age of Empires! If you didnt play this growing up you are a cheeky scrub.
Must have!
This game is legendary!!
"Awesome campaigns, decent graphics (for its time), excellent game for LAN parties and online play.  I grew up playing this game and would reccomend it to everyone."
aoe2.........nuf sed
You can't go wrong with this classic. I spent many hours/days/months/years playing on Microsoft's Gaming Zone in deathmatch games. Was even in one of their tournaments. My friend and I were both Britons vs. double Celts....and we won. Good times!
"I played this around 8 years ago as a kid, to see an HD version on steam with steam servers is definetely a must buy. Oh hey, there's currently a sale going on... BUY!"
Love it 11/0
Really happy this game is back with network support. I may suck online but it is still just as fun as I remember.
"good game, ♥♥♥♥ community, its made up by a bunch of angry competetive nerds who judge you on every crap move you do."
"If you enjoy moonwalking dudes, you should check out multiplayer!"
Legendary Game... nothing more to say.
How do you turn this on???
this game is incredible and you should play it NOW
Childhood reborn. 
A wonderful real-time strategy game brought back to life and even includes mod support. This game is well worth $20 usd but if you pick it up now you can steal it for only $3.
"Great classic game! It's been a great strategy game since its release back in 1999! Multiplayer rocks, though up until now it lags a little. Enjoy and have lots of hours of fun!"
"Just know that this game just barely qualifies as an 'HD' version. You won't really notice the difference while you're playing. But then, graphics are doing their job if you don't notice them.  Aside from that, a solid classic. Worth any RTS fan's time."
This game is just too much simple fun to pass up if you've never played it before. Tons of things to do and strategies to learn.  Played hundreds of hours of this as a kid. I plan to play hundreds more.
Im a guy who has little time to play this and my reviews are based on ease of getting into and lack of time to play. So firstly the tutorial at the start is great for a learner like myself into this genre. teaches you all the basics to start on a easy level. The tutorial does take a while to get through but is in stages and takes less than 30mins per stage. Once you have done that i just went to a single player against computer. Myself and AI at the start against AI. match was over in an hour and i really had no idea what i was doing. Second match me against just AI and again about 1 hour match on easiest settings. I have not played much since so my review is based on getting into it. Its an old game and graphics show that. Playability is fantastic and it is easy to learn and im sure with more practice i will start grouping people and doing bulk lots. As for time limit it will depend on your lvel of skill. if you got an hour and your good probably medium to hard. If your really new to this set it on easy for a quick 1 hour fight. i have heard some people playing for 2 hours but they were skilled playing each other. Int the steam sale this was $3.84 and well worth it for that money. at recommended retail I think you would have to be a fan of it to buy it.   Overall its fun to play easy to learn yet hard to master. Time limit depends on how you play and at what level. I give it a high five value award while on sale. awesome foursome for playability and a three pointer for graphics.  
"GOT IT FOR $10 on sale and thought i was the ♥♥♥♥, and now its on for $3 bucks!!! BUY IT NOW!! Great game, would overpay for it again"
It's Age Of Empire 2 ....nothing else need to be said !!!
One of the (if not) best RTS out there. Spent many months playing this great game when i was a teen. Together with Warcraft 3 this is a must for every RTS fan. 10/10
"Ever since this update, everything is ♥♥♥♥ing bugged so bad, your almost compelled to say '♥♥♥♥ YOU STEAM WTF' i had about 280 hours in before they updated it with this trash and its safe to say im ♥♥♥♥ing done."
"Used to play Age of Empires all the time when I was in Middle School, this game is great and i would definitely recommend it to any one!"
Probably everyone knows this game from their childhood etc. and have very good memories. So now we have it remastered in HD and with full steam workshop support... what is more important - multiplayer is alive so if you liked it before you will fall in love with it again... for hours/days/weeks. Trust me. I did.
"The game I sunk hours into as a child I can now play untill i get old and die. hasn't changed much, like a fine wine it has aged well."
"6/5 ez game ez lfe, would be 7/5 with sexslaves to soldiers."
"Despite the game being one of my favorites, I thought that after all these years the lag issue would be fixed. But as the name suggests, it seems only the graphics were updated. The lag becomes unbearable once too many units are on the map. There is a few second delay between every frame."
"Like a lot of people that played/are playing this, I have some good history with this game back in the day. Got it on sale for 2.99 (yeeesssss!) and from the moment I started playing it, I felt like it was 1999 again! Game still looks goo after all this time, and now that I'm older and wiser, I can fully enjoy it for what it is. I highly recommned this to everyone that like RTSs."
"After thousands of hours on my disk version, i decided to go digital, so here goes:  most certainly the best strategy game of all time, Age of empires 2 has deserved a remake for a long time, and while this widescreen (but not actually hd) remake is lacking in terms of new features. it does not take away from the original charm. Dont spend £20 on it though, buy it on the steam daily sale with the DLC for £2.84.  After playing it directly after the AOE 2 original retail version, here is my thoughts on its pros and cons compared to the original:  Pros: More resolution options for big monitors No longer needs to run in compatibility mode/can now switch between windows with ease. Revived multiplayer including a competetive rank Twich.tv integration Workshop support and new format means lots of new mods exclusive to the hd version such as texture packs Steam community meaning friends can invite you to games, you can take screenshots, read guides in game and so on  Cons: No lan laggy mouse Poor click detection Bugs main menu does not detect resolution unlike the ingame screen Overpriced   So overall, if you arent going to install many mods, play much online multiplayer or do any twitch streaming then get the original. Ideally i would recommend getting both so you have a LAN option. Happy Relic Hunting! "
"Ah, yes another 'HD' remasted game with little to no support. To discribe this game in one would, it would be 'unplayable'. Multiplayer will cause the game to crash every time. But you can play by yourself, so thats nice. If your a loner with no friends, this is the game for you."
"I haven't seen a different AI but still the game is as enjoyable as it was. Graphics are better, and i did prefered that second opus than the third one.  For few dollard, you'll play several hours. Very good bang for the buck."
Better Graphics New In-Game Music...But Multiplayer You Easly Get Kicked You Must Get Better Rank Or Something Like that... But I Advice You To Try It.
"Takes me right back to childhood, still a great game and probably the best rts ever made (especially for the current price)"
I never get tired of playing this game. The last I played it just made me wanna play it again so I did!
Never not worth the money!
you HD ♥♥♥♥ing quality lowered my fps drastically + over priced 4/10
this HD remake is amzaing cause i remeber playin this when i was just a little kid this was my very first computer game and im only 14 my brother showed me this game and i got addicted so im really happy everybody didnt forget about this amazing game
"This was the first RTS I've played in my life and I played so much that I dreamed with strategies and new plans to beat some levels.   Is AOE II at its best, the HD version has some flaws, but is the best way to play it on modern computers and believe me that you will enjoy every minute if you loved the original version."
I can play this game for hours on end
this game is this ♥♥♥♥ and if you buy it you will be the ♥♥♥♥
Awsome Strategy game! 10/10!
A worthy remake of a classic game. This makes it simple and easy to find players once again to enjoy some of the best RTS action every invented. One of my favorite games.
"Awesome game with a great soundtrack! It's even better if you played the original, but if you havn't... That's fine. It's still a fun game with historically correct characters, locations and so on. Worth every penny.  "
One of the best RTS games that I have ever played!
"A great remake of an old game. Age of Empires 2 was probably the highpoint of the series for me. Stability can be an issue, but crashes are few and far between. There aren't many RTS games like this anymore, and with the free-to-play model ruining the genre, this is a welcome comeback. If anyone wants to play a RTS from their golden age, AoE 2 HD is definatly worth the price."
Still one of the best games around.
"Let's party like in 1999! It's the best part of the series, now in HD.  Back in 1999 it was the best real time strategy game to date. After it came Age of Mythology and Empire Earth series, which were good, but still not that good as AoE.  Every civilization comes with its unique units and abilities, units are well balanced, and you have to really think and plan ahead your actions. Every unit is good against specific type of units (siege, cavalry etc.) and weak against another, so you cannot just build bazzilion of men at arms and rush at your oponnent, as you will be annihilated by couple of catapults.   If you have original version of AoE 2 - wait for a promo, and get it, if not - it's an insta-buy!  Pros - Good old Age of Empires 2 - Steam workshop with many many mods  Cons - Cliff textures are just awful - Still poor AI - Not fixed pathfinding issues"
Classic!  Pros: - higher population cap - can play with friends over steam  Cons: - LAN function is removed - Some issues with multiplayer (save often)
"I don't know what I can type about this game, other than that it is quite possible the greatest RTS ever made. You should buy it, immediately."
If (you love strategic games); System.out.println('Buy this game'); else System.out.println('Forget about this');
this game bring's me back to high school it was very fun then and still is very fun now . love the better AI makes the game very fun also you can have more then one of the Civilization on the game so you can see how the AI plays the same Civilization as you . has a better amont of Civilization to play as 13 i think with the forgoten
great game i highly recomend it. I tried to recomend it to my friend and finaly got him to get it and he loved it. definately worth the price.
Devs still play and update this game from time to time 10/10
An RTS classic revived.
"Highly recommened this game over the Age of Empires 3. The game play is amazing an amazing tatically fun, I could spend hours playing this game."
"this game is amazing, The most balanced rts i have ever played, they send calvary, make a formation of pikes, they use swordsmen, use calvary, they use pikes, use archers."
I nostalgia'd right out as soon as I started it up. A classic RTS that really hasn't seen too many come close to it.   Only problem I have with it is the sound keeps going back to 100% which rekt my ears.
"I really have to ask myself, 'Why can't they make a better RTS than AoE2?' I mean I started playing this in 1998! But they can't..."
i want 4 mac pleass
My childhood forever.
"The original classic, brought back to life!  Simply put, the game hasn't been adjusted or made 'HD' in reality - basically native widescreen support has been implemented (no need for 3rd party modded EXEs for the original AoEII!), with Steam integration &amp; match making functionality.   Simply put, the online play used to be so hit &amp; miss with players having different versions, no-CD cracks, etc - whereas now it simply just works!  Everything is as you remembered, and it's still great fun to play - especially with friends. Get ready for the 'Wololo' and 'Start the Game Already' spam in the Multi chat - this is definitely worth picking up, especially for £2.99 *(Xmas Sale is on as of the time I'm writing this).  Rogan? :)"
"You can't go wrong with AoE. The 2nd game I've ever played on the computer, the oldest, yet, still the best RTS game I've played to date.. I can't find anything wrong with this game! Must get if you've played AoE before!!"
Thumbs up for we want Age of Empires 1 HD remake. Also this is great classic remade with HD textures and lots of nice features including new civs and units. This and Age of Empires 1 is where my gaming started all those years ago.
"Absolutely funtastic, AOE 2 classic RTS!!! nostalgic"
cool
"Pretty fun game, tutorial was very informative while also keeping the gameplay interesting. Tried testing multiplayer but had a problem with other friends joining the game (i dont think they can join if cheats are enabled, known glitch?)   Overall I'd recommend spending the $0 getting it while it's on Steam Sale. Microsoft you've outdone yourself."
"I have to admit, I've been playing this game off and on since 2003. In my opinion, it rests right next to the classics like the Mario Bros, Zelda, and beloved games from the past. If you are looking for a RTS game, look no further, I have logged many hours with the game over the years, and I bet you will too."
While this remake takesme back to my childhood I dont appreciate when the game updates that it wipes all the saves I had for it. It is not like I spent my 4.6 hours on the same game anyway.
This game may be fun for you if.. damn it just buy it already!
"I love this game. I have played it a lot on Steam, but I have played it so much more since it came out. I was so happy when this game was updated through steam. I had to do so many things to play AOEII on current versions of windows, like change back to basic colors and change resolutions to make it look decent.   This game is very nostalgic for me and I will continue to play it amongst friends and single player games. If you can get over the outdated graphics, this is a must own for everyone. I have seen it as low as $3 during Steam sales, how can you pass it up?"
"An old classic, this strategy war game is addictive and highly enjoyable to play with friends. If you're looking for more of a solo attempt, any difficulty above easy will essentially be cheating in order to kill you without mercy faster, but is still plenty of fun (as long as you don't mind losing horrifically many times). I recommend this to all who enjoy a game that allows them to plan out their steps from your first settler to an overwhelming army, and with all the options in between, and who have friends that want to get in on the action (whether with you, or against you)."
"$2.99 for AOE II???? Awesome deal! Its a pretty old game, but definitely a classic and has aged pretty well. Still one of the most played games on Steam if you look at the stats under the STORE tab, so you wouldn't have too much trouble finding a match online. Highly recommend it!   Wololo/Wololo"
awesome still a classic and one the first and best strategy games out there!
"best rts ever, fun as heck and u can play it whenever ezpz 10/10 would buy if on sale"
"Well, Age of Empires II was one of the big classics of RTS. After the first part which played in the Antique and tought the player much about european history if he was willing to read all those history-parts in the scenario descriptions, AoE2 chose a different approach. The game now played in medieval times and the history was told by a narrator on the beginning and on the end of every scenario in the main campaigns, so that even the lazy ones got their education.  Now, what to expect on the HD-Edition? Well, of course some better graphics. If you have the original game (and 'the Conquerors'-AddOn) and don't think higher resolutions are worth the money, you might still want to buy the game to get the 'The Forgotten' DLC. It's a new set of campaigns about some historical persons who are well less known then those in the original game. For example Vladimir Tepesh, also known as Dracula (who was not a real vampire but a very bloodthirsty military leader who fought the osman Empire). And you will get some new nations to play.  So is everything well with the game? Not entirely. The developpers revised the random maps and some bugs still don't seem to be fixed. For example some AIs seem to have problems with a nomadic start which results in doing nothing at all. And the scenario intros on the 'forgotten' campaigns are not narrated as players of the original campaigns are accustomed.  Still it's AoE2 and hey - if you missed this game you can't understand the history of the RTS genre."
Great HD remake - Steam workshop for more maps plus beautiful new terrains/tile sets. Everything works. If you played it tons when it first came out you'll play it even more now.
"Awesome game that brings back a lot of good memories. Excellent upgrade, but there are big lag issues in multiplayer."
i've played this game for over a decade i plan to play it for decades to come 
You need this game.
How have you not already played this?
"It was one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever made, and still is. The updated version adds very little (unless you get the Forgotten DLC), but in the end of the day it is the same game you know and love, and it aged really well too. The best part is that it runs on pretty much any system with no tweaking necessary. If you haven't played an RTS before, this is also a great game to start off with; beginners and veterans will enjoy it alike. AoE 2 is fun to play alone, and especially with friends. Overall, I think this game is definitely worth a buy."
I like the bunny
A really nice back to the basics. This AOE is awesome in multiplayer !!
"An amazing RTS With so much to learn and master, Not just good for nostalgia but this can stand on its own as well, If you are a fan of real time stratagy you will not be dissapointed"
"Awesome RTS - sure the graphics are lackluster, the AI is either really dumb or an RTS master, and sure there are some things you can't do in newer RTS games (like changing the way your army is facing with a right-click drag) - but it has everything a great RTS needs to make it a great RTS.  Tons of civs, and tons of different strategies. If you want an awesome RTS that surprisingly holds up incredibly well for its age, get AoE 2. If you want a watered/dumbed down RTS made for kids, try AoE 3 instead..."
Great game !! It's awesome to have this good classic back in the new gen of HD. The graphics are are great improvment while still respecting the AoE II visuals!  A must for LAN parties!
"Nice game, nice graphics and nice sounds!!! And you can learn a lot of history with this game!!"
"Alright, before I give my honest opinion, I have to get some things out of the way. First, this game was exactly like it was when it came out originally but with a few more added features. The new textures are meh, except the water. Ripples look pretty legit. Next, it's been such a long time since I've played it, when I first got it, I was not expecting it to be fun...at all. Now that I have played it for 60+ hours, I can tell you this is the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game you will ever get, even for players new to AOE. RTS is a good genre for dedicated gamers, but this game is a must have. Screw StarCraft II, it doesn't have any historical significance. I mean, who doesn't want to kill the aztecs using the Mongols? Seriously. Get this game right now, I don't care if it's not on sale. No body has the time to wait for a sale. Returning AOE 2 gamers, get it right now. Don't listen to the other noobs about online play, it works perfectly. Even if you don't like this game, get it. You are going to have to like it; you don't have a choice."
"I played this game when it came out (i was like 6 years old) and just used cheats, and i still love this game until today. In my opinion it is the best real-time strategy game and it is really fun at lan-parties! 15 years old and just got a new DLC which is just as awesome as the basegame itself! A must-have in everyones library and worth every cent. I just cannot stop and sit sometimes for more than 6 hours in front of the pc and it never gets boring!"
Simply a classic.
great game
This is a good game. I like it.
"For 10+ years I've played Age of Empires II as well as the quickly released expansion, The Conquerors. And until the release of the HD version I was all but certain the game had died out. But now seeing the effect of the Steam platform and a visual improvement (as well as improvements to population cap and map size) it's incredible how alive the community has become. The game is fun in single-player in its own right, just as the Civilization franchise is, but the true experience comes from either campaigns or from online play. And now with The Forgotten expansion, players can take on 5 new civs with unique visuals and new technologies. It's easily my game of the year this year."
Recommended.
"Been playing since I was young, I enjoy this game very much! If you love one of those strategy games where you can control what you build and what you produce, this is the game for you. With various gamemodes and custom single and multiplayer, don't think you're going to see the light of day again until 3 days later."
living the micro life is the hard life.
Classic game - still rocks!
"Avoid the Forgotten realm at least you are a vicious of the multiplayer wanting more... I was hopping a regular campaign with regular voices... not even the voices appeared (At least not on other language than english)... the IA of the computer seem to be better BUT your own unitys now are more bad when walking on groups (usually blocking between themselve).   Conclusion: the classic game is that, and without no problem on single player, but the Forgotten don't seem to be really useful (First mission and probably my last one)."
Fantastic remake of a classic.
The Greatest Game That Ever Evered
This seems harder than back when I was 8 years old... Still all time classic and sooo worth getting. Multiplayer is also fun as hell
"This game is super fun to play, whether you are looking for a strategic challenge, or you are looking to control hundreds of villagers for a few hours. The feature of this game that I enjoy the most is the ability to build up the in-game economy."
"A true classic, works just like the original but with carefully updated graphics. Love it!"
"Classic real-time strategy at its best. 'Age of Empires II' is from a simpler age of RTS games with less resources to manage, more basic animations and a more basic set of rules. However, this means it's not bogged down in complicated concepts or overextensive resource managment.  With a wide range of cultures to play as and maps to play on, there's plenty of fun to be had on the custom game modes whilst the campaign(s), like in most RTS games, feels a little limp. Online gameplay is largely stable and it is often not too difficult to find an opponent of your own level, though personally I'd always recommend playing with friends.  The £15 price-tag is reasonable if you're an RTS fan wanting a nostalgia hit. General RTS fans may want to wait for a slightly lower price."
"very good recreation, exactly like the original"
"still just as good as i remember, everybody should own this masterpiece of a game"
Still one of the best RTS's out there   Online is working again thanks to steam.  
This game taught me more about history than any class ever did. Hours of gameplay planning the complete anihilation of your enemies while trying to keep alliances makes for endless fun for any RTS fan.
"7.9/10  Hot key commands that the PC version had from a decade ago are not apart of the game (though figure easy enough to put in, too lazy to look), besides that just like the original plus you have workshop additions (never tried those). If you liked the original back in the day then it won't disappoint"
"Due to the fact I have spent over 200 hours on this game, proves that I love it, reminds me of my childhood playing the first AoE. It never really gets old."
An absolute classic game. If you are a fan of RTS games then this should definitely be in your library.
"This game is definitely a throwback. I enjoyed reliving the nolstagia that I once remembered, sitting at 3 years old and pulling the plug from my dad's computer while he was playing multiplayer. HUEHUEHUEHUE"
Awesome classic. Loved it when it first came out. Love it now.
Your youth isn't complete if you haven't played this game
Awesome game that brings back bigtime warm notalgia to a sually sad heart. Mods are awesome.
Can play this game for hours o;
Awesome game. worth it.
This is my favorite game of all time. It's even better in HD.
"Absolute classic! Brilliant game, great multiplayer set up with steam."
just how i remember it. fantastic game
"The game is pretty nice. I hear many voices saying that the price is to high for a game this age, but I think a game like this, with a good online support system, and some new campaigns, makes it all worth it.   I shouldn't buy it when you only play single player though."
"I love the game overall, escpecially since I'm a fan of good RTS games, but you may want to grab a few buddies for this game. AoE II's AI isn't exactly all for the 'Epic Grand Battle' stuff, if you pick Moderate+ difficulty, get ready to be spammed by waves and waves of Petards, which can get very annoying. But their's good ways to counteract the Petard Spam; Mobile Ranged Units. But after the Petards the AI will spam you with Catapults and Archers. Even though I've only played about 17 hours of this game currently, I can easily counteract them, but my friend who is less skilled than me, not so much. He entitles himself a 'Master of RTS'' even though he can't beat me in a game of chess.   Now that the personal stuff is over, let's give you what you came to read. AoE II is a fantastic game, but you can't automatically become a master at it, it requires practice and (A LOT OF) patience. Beware this game will test your wits of RTS to the finest if set on the right difficulty. This game is also better than AoE III IMO. It's because AoE II has nations that technologies can turn the tides of battle even though you may be outnumbered 10-1 (unless the dude your facing Petard spams, remember kids, don't be that dude) but AoE III is basically 'Whoever has more riflemen and siege equipment win' but it's not a bad game. The Campaign of AoE II keeps you occupied too, but beware, if you do the Joan of Arc Campaign, the English have what they were good at in the actual Hundred Years War, Archers/Crossbowmen.  Evaluation  Pros: Entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat hoping you won't be destroyed, active Community, strategic decision making and planning, overall good AI, Okay Campaigns, not so steep learning curve, and accurate locations (sort of)   Cons: AI tends to spam Petards and Etc. if difficulty is Moderate+, Graphics are semi-old (I put this here for those people who complain about graphics), Some idiots in the community (But there's always has to be in every gaming community), Some people head straight for online instead of learning so beware of noobs, Buddies for this game are almost a must, beware of copycats of the AI stated above in PvP matches, and a final one is I suggest do not jump immediately into the game, do the tutorial campaign first."
ahh memories.....
Some classic RTS fun. Would buy again.
Classic!
This should in no way be considered HD.
"I have played the original AoE II back in the day on disk and I really appreciate what the devs are trying to do with this version - which is why I won't be refunding it. But after playing through only one game I already know that I cannot recommend it.   I have an i7 and Nvidia 860 GPU and this game just stutters way too much. At first it's not that big of a deal, but when you start building up sizeable armies and having multiple troops all over the place then the stutters and the frame rate drops are happening pretty much constantly and it just get too annoying to bear. I mean this game is over 15 years old and yet it feels like I'm playing through a very fast powerpoint presentation!"
"This legendary strategy game is back, now in HD and a plently of terrain and graphic customizations for free, made by fans. Plus the Forgotten Expansion, also firstly made by fans, introduces new civilizations, units and campaigns. Finally, you will find a new multiplayer challenge with ratings and custom maps.  A must have."
There is not much I can say about this game except that it is extremely fun. I had this game on disc and spent countles hours playing. Anyone that has it can say the same as they find find themselves waisting hours playing it.
A great HD remake of a classic game. I am forever in love with this. If you're a fan of AOE2 and miss playing it online. Get this game!
Good Strategy Game. However the games can be a little too short for my liking. All around Good Game
"Honestly, this is one of my favorite games on Steam. When i was younger, i spent countless hours playing the original Age of Empires. I built 100s of maps (no matter how cheesy or lame) and played countless games against my sister.   This game plays fairly similar to the original and thus, brings back lots of exciting and fantastic times. The second i discovered there was a remastered version of this game in steam, i purchased without a single doubt in my mind. I truly love playing this game and WOULD RECOMMEND to any true RTS lovers as well as those who dont play very many RTSs."
cool
its kinda like call of duty.
"Don't expect anything too HD with this release. It gives the game current resolutions, support for mods, and overall better textures. In those aspects, the game has improved. Unfortunately the pretty dated AI and pahtfining is intact, seeing no improvement.   With the mention of mods, it does add a layer to the game, and if you've been playing on a newer PC from an original disc copy it does alleviate the dreaded purple water issue. I also never saw it mentioned on the product page, but the base game is the original and both original expansions in one, so it has a lot of content.   Just as addicting as the first one, but don't expect very many graphical options that change the feel of the original game."
+nostalgic +steam lobbys +best RTS ever  10/10 would buy
10/10 would bang
"For original AoE2 players, the HD version will not disappoint. Just as fun as the original, but with less eye-shredding pixelation.  For people who have not played AoE2 before, I fully recommend it. It's a classic for a reason, and the price is reasonable."
Had a very fortified city untill one villager cut a path through the woods to have a massive gap in my wall  10/10 would create this massive gap again
Teutonic Knights. 'Nuff said. 10/10
aoe 3 is better tho
Amazing game; one of my favorites
"This game is perhaps the best game that I have ever played. It never gets boring and it's just so much fun. I like the fact hat they have lots of civilizations and features that go with it, and a map editor. The only thing that I disliked is that they're not so specific on the civilizations, because I'm from Denmark and it would be nice to have Danish Vikings in the game. Although they do reference us in the history page yet the Danish Vikings were the best Vikings, and I'm not just saying that because I am Danish. I say that because lots of countrys used to quake in fear of the Danes. Now they think that we're the capital of Sweden."
we need to play on a lan network so we dont lag
"i really on this game to the retro gamer, for me it not awesome game but awesome world historical."
"Despite the fact I suck at this game and never win versus my friends, I suggest it. Why? I only lose because I am only good at commanding units into battle, not about getting resources for a whole nation. But its also good because it is fair, fun, and a classic. And it even teaches a little about history. CoD dosent do that now, does it? DOES IT? XD. But also because it is an easy game to understand.  10/10 would suck but r8 positive again."
"Love it, everything about it, very smooth and fun for hours!"
Classic game and still one of my favorites! I really like the mods/skin packs which add alot to an already good game. Improved AI are very much a challenge and harder than the original. All in all it was worth the price for this gem!
"Great game! kill 'em quick or toy with the enemy.  5/5, 10/10, 385/385...you get the point"
this game is my childhood in a nut shell the game ill never stop playing 10 out 10 only down side is some of the mods dont load well
The gameplay is way too choppy and staggered. For a game so dependent on the mouse it is a disaster when the cursor staggers and or ignores what icon you have clicked on. I am running this on a machine that is WAY over-qualified for this game. No wonder AOE3 was downscaled so much - even this updated version of AOE2 is not capable of delivering all it promises.
"This game is not for those looking for an easy time.  -Style of Gameplay- '2D Overhead View Real Time Strategy' This is a real time strategy game using a semi limited resources concept. You have a 2D overhead view and can only issue orders in real time. There are 4 types of resources. Some of them are almost limitlessly renewable while others become scarce or run out depending on the scenario in question and your allowed level of advancement.  -Graphics- 'Average' Since this game is a bit older, the graphics are limited. However, this allows the game to run very smoothly and it can still run at an acceptable resolution without appearing pixelated.  -Historical Context- 'Stone Age to Colonization' Part of this games concept is building up a country from its very beginnings. You research from foragers and gatherers up to ships and cannons. It has fictional and non-fictional based stories from Britain, France, Spain, Rome, Middle East, and Asia throughout these varies time periods.  -Modding- 'Good' This game has a large community of map makers. It was a popular game of its time. It also had a nice resurgence after its rerelease on Steam. Many maps of all kinds are available.  -Shortcomings- 'Resources' Some resources are nearly limitless, some can be supplemented by others, and some units are available that don't require the more specialized resources. However, this game is still based much on the hoarding of resources. This can make for a very challenging game, but also a frustrating or boring game. Your patience and determination will decide."
&gt;buys copies of game while on sale &gt;gifts to friends &gt;no one plays with me &gt;i'll just grab this noose real quick...  Great game though.  
"Had a lot of potential to do well but failed at many aspects  Has serious lag issues, there is nothing to develop the scene etc etc"
"I first started playing this game when I was 9 and I've enjoyed it ever since. It was the first game that got me into the strategy and RTS genre. Definitely one of the best games for PC I've ever played. The graphics are a bit outdated, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. If you've played Civilization, this is sorta like that, but on a smaller scale. Collect resources, build up your city, create an army to defend yourself from or attack your opponents. Research technologies to help push you into the next age. Definitely a great starter game for if you're looking for something to get you into RTS. Their third one is pretty good too if you're looking for a fresh version with newer units, but this one is still my personal favorite."
I only play this game when I'm drunk. I don't know why.
"One of the first games my dad taught me how to play was Age of Empires II at the age of 5. Now that I have a gaming computer, it seems only fitting that I own the HD remake to one of my all time favorites"
"  Super fun, hilarious graphics, super nostaligic. Ever played the Warcraft series? This feels much like it. Would love to see another expansion."
Great game that I haven't played since I was like ten..
A HD remake for the old AOE 2 so you know it's going to be amazing
ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES JUEGOS DE MI INFANCIA Y AHORA SE ENCUENTRA EN HD... COMPRENLO ESTA ESPECTACULAR !!! XD
One of the first and best strategy games ever.
"My vote is a yes and no, kinda neutral about it...so I guess I'll point out some things.  This game can be a highly strategic game or a fast-plotted paced game. I've played it several times, and I must say, once I start, I can't stop. I get so caught up in all of the building and placing (in otherwords, things that appeal to my inner girlie) and completely forget about 'leveling up' other things. So if you're like me and you're in it for only the designing part of the game....this isn't for you, though I hear there's an Age of Empired III that focuses a little more on the designing aspect of the game.  It's a good game, and what I liked most was that you're able to play it with many people at once, which is pretty neat. Not to mention you can choose the different ethnics of a people, which I happen to think is even neater.  What's sad, however, is that my hubby already owned the game but because it was purchased through Microsoft YEARS ago, it held no validity on Steam - in the end, we just purchased it again for the sake of having it. And now, my hubby and I play it to pass some time. And once you're in, you're sucked into the world of conquering. X3"
"Being able to play AoE 2 again is fantastic! The updates definitely add to the fun, but all the original content is there. Monk not needed to convert this player. :D"
I can now die in peace.
Its old but in HD
"Age of Empires 2 is, without a doubt, my favorite game of all time. Its not just nostalgia talking, either. It may lack a few quality-of-life features that more modern RTS like Starcraft 2 have, and the meta has been relatively unchanged for almost the lifespan of the game (Although, the new expansion changed it up a lot, and fan made balance mods are quite popular, so look out for those if playing online) but it still stands as a masterpiece of the RTS genre in both mechanics and single player creative value. It still has a pretty big online playerbase for a 15 year old game, too.   Now, dont expect a huge new overhaul for the HD version. Its pretty much just a widescreen mode and a resolution bump, a new largest pop cap at 500 and a new larger map size, 'Ludakris', but there are tons of good texture and unit packs in the workshop if you want your game to look a bit more shiny than a 1999 release title :p  The issues, however, are noticeable. The game does not run very well for its age. Now, just speculation, I think that may have to do with the fact that it cant use more than one CPU core at a time. This problem only gets more noticeable when you add more players, higher population caps and larger maps, and more AI players. Playing a 4v4 on a Ludakris size map can tank your framerate VERY easily. Now, I dont really see that as a huge issue myself, but it may ♥♥♥♥ off other people, and understandably so.  Still, these problems aren’t too terribly huge. AoE 2 is still a fantastic game, and one that is worthy of any RTS fan's time."
"I still have my original copy of AoEII + Conquerers Exp, but since steam was offering it for $3.50 for both the AoE II HD and the newest expansion I bought it to see what the HD was all about. The game works as advertised, however it still needs a little optimization work on it. I will still recommend it though since the bugs I did see didn't ruin the gameplay.   I noticed that when you move your own units the enemy AI will stop moving for a second as if the game is recalculating the AI path. Never noticed that in the original game."
pretty excellent game - what else can i say
"I previously owned the original game on disk with the conquerors expansion pack and it was great, but with the new forgotten expansion pack and remastered graphics this game has now become my favourite RTS again"
Greatest game in existence.
"I fell in love with the original sries and this makes me want to play them all over again. AOE2 never really left my machine once i found a 3rd party app to play online, and now i dont have to because steam now supports it."
One of the best strategy games I have ever played.
"+Cavalry attacking ships +Building a new kingdom with one villager left after a war +Insulting your opponents with walls(like gg,fu,gtfo) +Scouting unexplored lands with sheep(because scout is to suspicious) +Focused villagers(getting goods while wolfs attacking them)  anyways this game is a classic and you should buy it!   11/10 would type ''how do you turn this on'' to see if it works on multiplayer"
"Perfect 'remaster'? Is that what we're calling these things, I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, if you liked AoE, you'll love this. It's not a remake, it's basically the same game (with a few new twists) and it's much prettier than trying to run the original on modern hardware."
"Converted catapult to Christianity, 10/10"
"Getting like 22 frames per second on an i5-4670K, 8gb of ram and GTX670 graphic card... Very poor performance...  The engine can't handle multiple AI's. For me, playing on the biggest map, with 8 other people or AI components is a must. Without having to compensate on poor performance and a stuttering engine.  Bought for Nostalgia, returned for worse performance than it's 1999 original."
One of the most fun games I have ever played. I can play it foe hours on end without realizing how much time has gone by. It is an old game but still really great. 10/10
"Awesome game to play, alone or with friends"
"This game in my opinion is great but i do got to say it does have its Pros and Cons. The Pros are that the game is remastered in HD and that you can play with multiple people online. It has a tutorial,Campaign, and Multiplayer section for those who are picky. On the other hand you can also set up a private game for you and your friend to play and you can even add bots. There is only one con and that is that the game tends to lag every now and then but other than that i give it a solid 9.5/10 Rating"
"This game has been one of my favourites for many years and now with this remake it's even better. Thanks for bringing back my childhood Microsoft, your not going completely downhill in your company ;)"
This game is garbage and I don't get how to build faster and  -WOLOLO-  this game is awesome.
"This game is amazing, a true classic and belongs in any strategy gamer's collection."
Classic AOE.  Played the crap out of this back in the '90s.  Now its optimized to run bigger and better.  Going to play the crap out of it again.
gives such a great nostalgia feeling
Amazing remake of the orginal! Must buy if fan of AOE 2
"HD remake of one of the best RTS games ever made. Adds modern multiplayer, widescreen support. Lots of other stuff improved over the original. YES!"
one of my most favorite games of all time
"If you liked Age of Empires II, this is exactly like Age of Empires II."
"Friends: 'Hey, wanna play Ages of Empires II?!' Me: 'Ah, don't you mean you want to play Chop Wood Simulator?'"
"18 Years ago I got really heavily into AoEII as an active members of the Ldz_ clan. Ldz_Chopper. Found this on steam again, and fell back in love with it 18 years on. Great to see content is still being developed for it without taking away from its original, like the subsequent titles became. A great civ strat game, possibly the greatest."
"Age of empires? Re released? Multiplayer? NEW expansions? Well, i suppose i can't say no to that, can I? "
"It's the recurring dream that you have everyday every night, for the past XXXX years. Over and over again, it's driving you mad. You cannot take it any longer. This dream starts off the same all the time. You wake up, it's 3pm in the afternoon and you call this morning, You take a ♥♥♥♥, eat, and go to your computer. You ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on various forums and do nothing for the proceeding hours, you are already logged into steam, but rarely play any games, you use it as a platform for deviancy. You roleplay with underage children and you feel like ♥♥♥♥, not because you blame yourself, you blame others for how much of a cancer you are to the world. This proceeds for a couple of more hours, here and there you eat ♥♥♥♥ food that are empty calories, you are a fat ♥♥♥♥ sometimes or you are a skinny skeleton who is malnourished. Finally as the night is ending, you jerk off to some really questionable material, and finally you go to bed. Than you wake up, and the dream wasn't a dream, it's your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ life.

Recommended to all mah frendz n fans
"I love this game in all its simplicity. No fancy units just build a big army, navy or both and break stuff! Yes, the AI isn't very clever and depending on how many units you are trying to move, you have to help them do the most basic of things like going somewhere but for me, that's one of the charms. For me, at my age? Simple is GOOD. This one is in my top 3 favorite RTS games."
Converted enemy transport ship with enemy troops still inside.  Wouldn't convert enemy troops inside.  Convert 4 more transport ships. Killed fifty enemy paladins by sinking ships using the delete button. 10/10.  Do you even wololo?
you can have an army of elephants.... nuff said
"CLASSIC STRATEGY GAME PERHAPES THE BEST, NOW WORKS WITHOUT CLOSING EXPLORER.EXE =)"
"All time classic strategy game. Although the graphics now may feel outdated you can still lose yourself for hours through conquest random maps or the historical scenarios. Dont expect Total War AI here as knights find trees as big an obstacle as trebuchets and idle villagers scatter the land, easy prey for the random wildlife to chew on, howver this will forever remain one of my favourite games XD"
"This HD remake is awesome. Same old fun, slightly updated graphics"
REK NOOBS OLD STYLE 11/10
"I can't finish a single game because it continues to crash... AND MY ELO GOES DOWN!!! THIS IS TOTAL BS I TELL YOU...  AND I LOVE THIS GAME, WHY DID U RUIN IT?"
Great Copy of AoE 2 that is updated to run on new OSes and with HD textues.   2 thumbs up
Happy to see a game from childhood has improved to HD! Oh yes.
If you're after a bit of nostalgia look no further than AOE2 HD. All those memories of medeival combat and economics are back plus some excelent extra bits to make it fresh and engaging once again! just wish i could find an AOE game as well to complete my trip to past times! Cannot recommend this enough for serious AOE fans.
"The latest changes to AOE are horrible. Bad colors, goofy mouse pointer etc. Why did it get changed? Enhance function maybe or fix bugs but mess around with something that has worked well for 10+ years? Bogus."
"I wish I could win religious debates by waving my arms and shouting 'Wolololo,' but since it doesn't work in real life, I have to settle for doing it in Age of Empires 2."
"I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game; 2 points. 1 pt- No unit variation; the AI/player can just mass hundreds of longbowmen and you're ♥♥♥♥ed. 2 pt- Castle hell, the AI/player (mostly AI) will just spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of castles EVERYWHERE.  I know this review will get a lot of 'hate', but this is just why I dislike the game. Haters gonna hate."
I've been playing this game since I was little. This game is an excellent RTS and brings back good ol' memories.
the best game i have ever played!
"Play as huns to witness the power of population booms that happens in the real world. Play as mongols to be the late bloomer that screws everyone up if they leave you until imperial. Play as franks to be that person. Play as aztecs to be the eagle god. Play as koreans to witness the powers of spamming towers and siege. Play as the vikings to slam people on the water while tributing everything to that guy on your team. Play as the magyars to throw trash at people and still dominate. Play as the mayans....to WOLOLO. Play as the chinese, britons, byzatines, celts,goths, japanese, persians, saracens, spanish,teutons, turks, italians, indians, incas and slavs..... wait, who plays those 11"
Everytime i lose the game runs fine BUT WHEN I AM ♥♥♥♥ING WINNING IT FREEZES OR PLAYERS GET DROPPED ♥♥♥♥ YOUR PATCHES AAAARHRHHHGGGHHH!!!!!  I do not recommend buying this game for multiplayer right now its broken!
Just as much fan as the original. 'Dont point that thing at me'
Just how i remember it from 1999 when i got my first desktop computer. Came bundled with the windows 98 disc pack. It's even more awesome now with the improved graphics.  10/10.
all ways been a great game
"I love the Age of Empires games, and Age of Mythology, sucks Ensemble Studios was shut down, I would love to see an Age of Empires IV or even Age of Mythologies II (exclusive to PC, of course). I've only played a handful of RTS games and Ages is my favorite."
One of the best games i have ever played dont even think about the price if you are worried. Just buy
"Don't get me wrong, I think this is an awesome game. I love playing as japan especially, but what I dont understand is why it has so much more fans than age of empires 3. I personally feel that 3 is superior in every way to this already amazing game, so why does this game get all the glory? why is it that there are so many more features, such as workshop and achievements, available for this and not 3? i really love this game, but ive played this for about 16 hours, while i've gotten well over 100 in age of empires 3, and never get board of it. that being said, if you can't decide wether or not to get this game, i highly recommend it. edit: so after playing this a bit more i realized i was being a bit unresonable of my judgement of it. it is truely a great game and if you can't deside wether to get it or not i highly recomend it"
The best strategy game ever...
"This a great example of an older RTS game. Despite its title, it's not actually 'HD'. But considering this game is at least 10 years old, the graphics are half decent. Plus there's the added bonus of Mongol Mangudai hordes overrunning a Turkish castle in the middle of a snowy pine forest. Or some random ♥♥♥♥ like that."
ONE OF THE BEST RTS I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do not waste your money on AOE 2 HD edition. The devs do not care about the performance of the game and constantly break it with new patches. I have posted numerous times in all the discussion threads for the game and have not had a single dev comment on any of my issues. They appear to have little knowledge of anything and constantly blame Ensemble Studios for the issues that did not even exist in the original game.  The game worked fine in version 3.9.
"This is a great game. The campaigns are all great. There is not much HD about this remake but at least it runs properly without problems with compatibility and color (which are issues I've faced trying to run the original on Windows Vista onwards). Moreover, the game is being actively patched. I can count on my fingers the number of big releases/remakes that get patched this frequently and after such a long time after release."
A good rehash of the original with added content and mods available. ****
"Fantastic oldschool pc game, beautiful graphical HD remake, huge replay factor especially online, great buy."
""
"Well if you do get this game i shall tell you my tactics. first there is the 'allhu akbar' where you just get kumocazi troopers and charge like you beleave you will get 72 virgins  then there is the 'china over population' which is my favorit for many victorys, first you just spam pikmen and skirmishers untill the others teams expense high quality troops die and get over run.   And the last all call 'day got rekt m8' due to the fact you only have catuplt troopers that rain hell upon your enemys.   That is how you get good at the game. because who doesn't like spamming"
"Great for those who love chess and video games. Using realtime strategy you must build and defeat either the computer AI of other players in online battles. Also, there are some good cheats which are allowed. My favorite one is 'how do you turn this on' and gives you a Cobra sports car with machine guns. Have fun!"
2nd best RTS ever. 1st has to go to warcraft 2
"Absolutley spectacular! I love all the game modes, steam achievments, and different ways to spice up your game like senarios and other amazing features!"
it was okay
"if i look back on my life, the activity i have done most over everything else is play AOE2 (and that includes sleep). But this is mainly a thumbs up and thank you to the devs from the community.  Thank you for realizing the classic that this game is. Thank you for putting time and effort into refreshing and upgrading the game. Thank you for improving this rather than flogging the title with a new AOE(4). Thank you for the expansion. Thank you for understanding a masterpiece should be cleaned and polished rather than replaced. Thank you for giving this a future rather than making it the past.   P.S. thank you for the removal of XP fanboys. No one can 'weed a garden' like you devs."
Still the very best RTS game ever made! Been playing this since 1999 till today and coming years :)  The last update also partly fixed perfromance issue with 900+ units on the map. So far runs great with 1200 units / 3 players.
It's a classic. And the expansion just makes it even better. Great game!!! Keep up the goodwork.
Great RTS game placed in the middle ages. Though lack of adjustment for video quality may cause complications.
"Don't get me wrong, the game is very good. However the optimalization is very bad and there isn't much people playing. It's better to just find your old copy and play online on voobly with unofficial hd community patch (google it). Tons of players, very competetive with elo system.  Anyway, if you already have the game, don't buy it, it's waste of money."
"one of the best games Ive played on PC been playing this game from time to time over the years. its totaly worth your time if you like building towns and castles and fighting armies. I still remember most of the cheats by mind type these in in your chat bar be warned you will not get acheivements on games you use these on. cheese steak jimmy's (meat) lumberjack (wood) robin hood (gold) Rock on (stone) those are just some of the cheats you can use find the rest online also Simply copy and paste any cheat (using CTRL + C and CTRL + V, respectively) as many times as you desire. best to play the campagne with out cheats to to fully enjoy yourself. also theres an awesome forge mode where you can make your own map. still plenty of people playing online together at the time of writing this. try putting hundreds of solders for fun on a plank map and see what happens. my old compage pc could handle hundreds on screen so you should not have to worry about game freezes with this game."
"Probably the best Strategy game ever, (DotA and LoL fans may dispute this,) in AoE or in AoM you build up your empire/base, manage an army, build it, feed it, plan attacks, siege and defend as well as researching technology and improving your economy, the HD graphics details mqake it even better, hope for more DLCs!"
"great game, still a lil glitchy with some enemies able to pass through my wall"
I love this game
Great HD version of an amazing game from the 90s.
"If you were like me as a kid, you didn't even OWN the game! You just played the demo and OVER played it, drained the map of everything and just slaughtered EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!"
The Celts fight the Aztecs.  10/10 - History teachers
Brings back the all time favorite AoE 2 would recommend it to any AoE fan
"First game I ever played  Also, you can make your entire empire kill themselves as a mass sacrifice to the dark lord chin chin"
"An excellent game for people who love RTS games. This is a fairly easy to learn, game that has a lot of different things to do that help new users fall in love and old users re-discover this timeless classic.   I have been playing the Age series for as long as I can remember, and always have loved the aspects of this game. I would 100% recommend this, definetly worth the money."
"A fully-functional update of an RTS classic. Perfect for both serious strategy gaming and a burst on nostalgia, this HD update also adds Steam Workshop and Steam online play facilities, ensuring that a constant stream of mods and battles against your friends (and other internet users) help keep the game remarkably fresh,"
"SHEE HOO - you just bought the game and a villager was born, this game is probably one of if not the best RTS ever it is an incredible game with heaps of mods and playability get it please :D"
"Nostalgia,steam workshop and a new campagin. Yes please! One of my favorites strategy games."
One of my favorite games of all times. Definitely recommend this game!
One of the best games existing!
Totally faithful and runs super smoothly on my machine. Could not be happier with this nostalgia trip!!
"My favourite Strategy Game of all time.  But the developers need to release a massive patch for fixing the multiplayer problems. The players automatically dropping, the game desyncing and lagging is very annonying. Come on developers, even the PS4 and XBOX games despite their size can handle huge multiplayer very easily."
easily one of the best games ever it might not have the best graphics but for what it is it's amazing i love this game lol even after all these years of playing i still find it amazing lol
"Age of Empires II HD  Before i start this review, please note that i am not a native english speaker/writer so excuse my average english.    Age of Empires II HD is as the name says , a HD remake of the old game Age of Empires II.The game is a realtime strategy game, which has both a competetive and a casual scene. Given the fact that pretty mutch everybody already knows about this game, ill just tell you the differences between the old game , and this HD remake.  First : There is a DLC called the forgotten , it is fun but nobody plays it online , so you will mostly play it SP , speaking of online the game features a lobby system allowing up to 4v4, you generally will find games, and if your good enough even make it to the top.  Sorry for the short review , got no time recently.  Also check my Mass effect review(s) and my Sanctum 2 review :)"
"One of the best RTS games, probably not worth getting at the current price but grab it if it is on sale, the game looks much nicer now. Plus they threw in a bunch of new challenging campaigns and 5 or so new civs. I have to admit though some of the new civs seem a bit underwhelming and don't play particularly well, I imagine this is cause they didn't want to disrupt the existing balance with new OP civs but still, the bonuses and new units left me a little disappointed. Still fun though. New map size and population caps are nice for epic sized battles. 200 always felt limiting in the past, now I rarely can even get near having 500 pop. Worth getting on sale."
"More than a decade since the game's initial release, this game is still relevant- for a reason. This game was a fixture of my childhood, and I was delighted to get another chance to play for such a reasonable price. The campaigns are in depth, the gameplay is functionally optimal, the multiplayer is new every time (with only a few moments of lag), and the updated graphics are stunning. The game even tricked me into learning about the featured civilizations with informative overviews on the main menu.  TL/DR you'll get your money's worth: 95/100"
this is the greatest game ever created
This Game is consecitivly given my computer two trojans within the files.
"its not 2 fun but its a gud game, dont buy unless on discount"
"Great game despite its age, made even better with workshop mods."
I love playing this game so much but every time i try to play a scenerio or Single Player is says 'Waiting for Others Players' and il wait for about 3 hours before trying again the next day and still does that please healp me fix it other than that i'd recommend this game to everyone in my family tree  P.S I think they should add the first Game
Great remake of an awesome game!
Great Multiplayer Experience!!
"I loved this game until it stopped working when I had to get a new PC with Windows 8.1 instead of Windows 7 :(  I grew up with the AOE series so when this version came out I was thrilled and am desperate to play it again but nothing I have tried can get it to work (reinstalling the game, disabling firewalls, verifying cache, changing the name of the launcher file etc. as recommended by several other players who are having the same issue). After looking through several forums it seems I am not the only one who is unable to get any further than the first splash screen before the game crashes. Such a shame.  When working though it is still just as fun as the original version, just a little bit tidier and easier on the eyes :) For those who have Windows 7 I would definitely recommend it."
we wuz kingz ♥♥♥♥♥ i swear ♥♥♥♥♥ that alberto barbosa guy told me ♥♥♥♥♥ ai swear nig
"if you played years ago, you will love it. It's the same one but works fine on Windows 7 and 8.1 x64 and Windows 10 x64 :) with multiplayer thanks to steam :)"
Old school game that has only got better with age!
"One of the best RTS game these days. HD version has really made an old game playable. For new players or those who come from older version I wouldn't recommend playing public multiplayer first, even noob lobbies as they're full of good players. Go through campaign, play with bots or get your friends with same skill level to play with you. A lot you can learn from pro games on youtube as the basic start for every game doesn't change. After all this isn't an easy game to play and will take a time to get good at it, unless you're good at other RTS games. It's really fun to play esspecialy with your friends. Would recommend it 100% you won't regret buying this game for sure."
"This classic games.. at 2000 i have played this game, almost 16 years now. Never bored to play this game.. it is just brilliant"
"An amazing reinvisioning of my favourite game ever to exist, great graphics and extended gameplay stays with the same format we loved from the original. Love it!"
Really happy that I can play age of empires now in 2016. Still an amazing game with more features.
This is the last great RTS game to include a random map generator offering almost infinite replay possibilities.
dated but addictive
This game is absolutly amazing! I've had a very fun time on it!
i cannot put a game together
"Waiting for bug fixes, better optimization (works like s***), stable campaign more than 2 years and what we got? New money-grabbing dlc with more bugs. In this game you cant even change the display res and with new update i lost all my save games. I give up with this game.  Do I recommend this game? HELL NO"
So nostalgic. Really takes me back.  The new AI is quite smart...  Oohlulu!
The game is now fixed! Thx microsoft.
Awesome strategy game for all peeps!
Still an excellent game after all these years. The HD upgrade is very well done. One of the best RTS ever made but can also be very hard on certain settings.
"After the bug where it crashes after 5 minutes of game play, my life has come to a signifigant low. I live in an endless 5 minute loop of starting the game, getting kicked out and then back from the start, my life expectancy is plummeting as i write this.. i need to reopen the game soon again or brain = Slushy ..  Brb trying again"
"Anoying low FPS count problem persists after a bunch of patches. In single player when you have a population of +50 (aprox) the frame rate drops to a 5-11 range. I used to play the original AoE 2 Conquerors in my actual PC and never had this problem. I'm still awaiting a solution to it. Don't buy it, first download it from other source and try the FPS of the game, that way you won't dump money in something unplayable...like i did."
The nostalgia is real.
Got into it thanks to my dad years ago and its still just as fun as then
Please make this game available for MAC
"One of the best RTS games ever made now remastered, what more could you possibly ask for? Seriously get it so I can actually win a game."
This game is a classic and a must own for RTS fans. Online is still active enough to get a game whenever you want and the game has aged very well. Go yourself a favor and pick this up!
I'll beat you back to Age of Empires.
"This game was great at its time, now it's just dumb and outdated. I wished that Steam stopped trying to milk our money with old stuff like this and...   *Wololo! Wololo! Wololo!*   This game is freakin' great! Loved it then, love it now! Thanks Steam for bringing this back! 11/10"
"I have been playing the AoE series for for over a decade now and to me, they are just as fun now as they were back then! It's worth waiting for the steam sales for AoE II where the price drops to about $4 dollars. So if you are thinking of buying it, but aren't willing to pay the money right now, just wait a bit and I gurantee that it will go on sale at the most within two months."
"Childhood memes :D, 8.75/10"
Nice game
"An excellent, faithful remake of a great classic. Don't expect too much beyond compatibility changes (to allow modern computers/resolutions to play this game) though. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but gonna try it soon."
600 year old fat king outran all of my opponents horses. I love this game as much as I did in the 90's
"i play this since i was a kid,still rocks"
"Huge fan already, rose tinted nostalgia glasses on and off. The balance amongst a plethora of races is going to lead (for myself) to an unnecessary amount of hours invested in exploring each individual races unique natures. Gitting gud (online) is a difficult but rewarding process, even if casul; paired with a loyal fan basis maintaining a decent number of multiplayer servers keeps the game quite alive. Lastly the single player campaigns offers a fair amount of hours to chew through and are fun to boot. In contrast to many current releases lacking a single player campaign this is a decent inclusion not lacking in creativity and historical intrigue to enjoy. - 2/10"
"Great RTS to play with friends at one of the better prices you will find these kinds of games at. personally didnt play many of the Age of Empires series but this one does a good job of making you realize why the game has such positive reviews. I would add this one to the collection of RTS games to play with friends or kill some time alone on, both are equally enjoyable"
"I remember playing this for hours in my dad's computer and I would get really excited whenever i hear the theme song playing. Now I can play this with the game of thrones theme song on for extra awesomeness.  I remember playing this for hours commanding a hundred soldiers and a squad of trebuchets toppling down castles and massing fortifications. Now i can command HUNDREDS of soldiers and a squadron of trebuchets for extra epicness.  I remember playing this for hours playing the awesome campaigns with the likes of genghis khan, Barbarossa, El Cid and Joan of arc. Now i can play MORE campaigns with the likes of a Conquistador, Italian mercenary and a visigoth barbarian for extra content.  I remember playing this in my dad's old computer lagging a bit but i would still enjoy and have the time of my life. Now i get to play this is 1080p and 60 frames per second for extra beauty.  I would remember the corny sound-effects, taunts and voices like 'wololo', *soldier trained sound* and *villager trained sound*. now i can hear it with good audio and cool downloadable taunts from the workshop like Arnold Swcharzenegger for extra funnyness (is that even a word?)   My childhood would never die when this game, Age of Empires II, is still around."
"Age of Empires II HD is the same old classic AOE II that everyone loved years ago. Since it is essentially the same game, don't expect too much different gameplay wise, barring some balance changes and the relatively new fanmade-turned-official expansion, The Forgotten Empires. However, the gameplay is still solid, as the AOE franchise is a cornerstone of the RTS genre.   As I generally do not play on the highest graphics setting, and I pay more attention to gameplay than graphics, I did not notice that much different (referring to the HD part). However, the game does look nicer than the original.  The online component actually works now, as steam has integrated their own lobby browser into the multiplayer function. As such, you no longer need a third party client like GamesRadar to play online with friends and others. The online portion also has some sort of matchmaking system (similar to ELO or MMR in other games). This is a plus in my eyes.  As far as negatives, 20$ isn't too bad for the original game, as it is such an amazing classic that still holds up today. However, around 10$ for each expansion seems a little high - especially concerning the fact that The Forgotten Empires was originally a fanmade game that is free. (Although I realize they need to make money to cover development costs of porting to steam, adding textures, constantly balancing, etc.) I would recommend waiting for a Steam sale like I did. However, the Forgotten Empires does add some good content to the game. I do not, at this point, own the second expansion, which includes the African Kingdoms. However, there is a nice little feature which allows civilization rotation of un-owned civilizations which allow you to test them at certain times.  The game also features a custom mapmaking mode, which may be the same engine that the original had. I have not extensively tested this, but if memory serves correct, one can get pretty creative with it and make some cool scenarios.   Overall, if you like the RTS genre, or just medieval-style games, or you have a few friends that you just want to mess around with in the various game modes and settings, this game is for you."
one of my Favorite game but now its not the same like it was before on msn gaming zone. Lots of bugs ping problems  and lobby problems if they dev team pays more attention on them it could be same or better then it was years ago
"AOE is as great as ever. I would say even better, seeing how it's fully integrated with steam, and setting up a game with friends online was a breeze.  It's one of those games that you hardly see it's age. Sure, the menu's are a bit oldschool, but that doesn't take away from the experience. And maaaan, what can i say about civilizations description, and all the little details that make this game not only great, but stays with you for a long time. Even if it doesn't go into crazy amounts of historical detail, it surely isn't a vapid superficial game. One of the things i still aprectiate about old school PC games like this, it doesn't make you feel like a moron."
"I've played the AOE franchise since I was 6 or 7, and to this day it still stands as one of my favorite video games I've ever played. I still play it as an adult now and with the new expansions, it warms my heart to see one of my childhood favorites being updated and getting new civs. Now all we need is Star Wars Galatic battlegrounds to come back."
"I owned Age of Empires 1 and 2 back when I had Windows 95 - Windows XP.  It was my first experience with RTS gaming and made me realized just how talented you have to be to multitask and play RTS games.   If you are looking for a nostalgic experience and love RTS games, check this out. The Local LAN gameplay is superb! As is the ability to play online (somewhat) using some special software.  If you find this game on sale, add this to your library. You won't be disappointed."
I remember waking up to the screams of my parents that sunny sunday morning and turning on my computer to hear the soothing and glorious sounds of the soft 90s music going through my speakers.  Playing this game brought all my wonderfull memories of battles and conquest but that was before the plague hit and the Hrutlagr Clan attacked my village.   I was a young creature back then and had only risen from my cocoon not too long ago and even tho i was the oldest son  I did not understood why my people had to fight but my father knew what had to be done.   He send me and my 3 brothers to the northern forests of Alrymir to run away for the giant spike covered hounds of the Hrutlagr war chief.   When we realised we ran for days and soon enough i realised we didint had much food left and my youngest brother Lorrekan was weak and sick from the plague.  I didint had much of a choice and it was only until the darkness of the night came to us when i took my dagger and stabbed him in the the chest and opened his Torax and fed him to my brothers so they could live.   I still remember the look on his 7 eyes staring at me with a fear and sadness that you cannot even begin to understand Those were dark days indeed.
"EDIT:  Most bugs have been patched right now. The idle villager button works again, loading times have decreased a little and out of sync games happen less frequently (they still happen thou  I actually recommend this game right now.   With the new update, i cant recommend this game, at least not until it has been patched.  - Loading times of SP/MP games are extremely long - A lot of bugs have been introduced since this new DLC was released effectively making the game annoying to play. The idle villager button for example (which is a must have with 70+ villagers) isnt working anymore. - The playerbase of this DLC is minimal, multiplayer games are a pain to set up because no one will join it. -People will randomly be dropped when MP matches start, resulting in unfair teams and generally the opponent resigning (because he is 1 teammember down from start)  This game isnt worth buying without its DLC's, and those DLC's just arent worth it right now. Wait it out till this gets patched/improved, then consider it again"
Greatest RTS game I've ever played. Too many hours of my life spent playing this game and it was totally worth it. If all of my hours playing this game were logged on Steam it would probably reach the 1500 mark. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. I'd give it a solid 5/7.
not bad when you dont get ronny ♥♥♥♥ing your freshly made villagers and just ♥♥♥♥ing you in general that ♥♥♥♥.
"Short &amp; sweet review: a classic re-invented and re-invigorated. New content &amp; DLC much like the old content but gratifying nonetheless. Plus originally I didn't have Conquerors so lots to explore &amp; enjoy, history to rewrite!"
"Anyone who plays this game will love it, period. It can be played thorugh using strategy and cunning as well as brute force, which is why it's so fun. You can use so many different methods and strategies to play it is mind blowing how addictive it becomes."
"You'll play this game properly at first. It's a lot of fun like that, despite the outdated graphics (HD? Pfft), and glitchy gameplay. Then you'll find cheats, and invest four thousand hours into this game. Four thousand might be an exaggeration. Like two thousand. Minimum (ignore my 50+ hours it's actually two thousand). This game is a great classic and my favorite in the series. I seriously recommend you buy it."
What is wrong with AoE II HD after update (05.11.15) ?
"just as good as ever, definetly a must have. Cant see any HD in the game but it does run alot better and the expansion has a great."
A Classic. for those who like RTS just buy it! :)
"This is one of those games that you can play for 2 hours and it only felt like 5 minutes. Lots going on at once, super fun, definitely recommend it!"
Awesome enhanced version of the game!
"This game really puts me in the time period, because the multiplayer lag makes me feel like I'm on windows 98 playing over dial-up."
ITS AWESOME!!!!!! Seriously you'll love it. (Especially if you like history/ ancient civilizations and stuff)
Used to own this on disc. Now I have it on Steam.  WOLOLO/WOLOLO Would wololo again.
"Not only did they improve the graphic quallity and the controlability, they fixed a large amount of bugs which made this game too challenging for me to play, there's one major bug which could (if it hasn't already) become a problem, in which the idle worker hotkey/button doesn't function. (If anyone has a solution, I'd love to hear it.)"
Still one of the greatest strategy games ever released. 10/10
GG You have this game
"This game was a classic strategy game of my youth. To be able to play this again is a delight, along with the new content that's being released for the game! Real Time Strategy at it's finest!"
I never knew that Africans used to be white!
"♥♥♥♥ the graphics, this game has been raising generations.."
Best strategy game by far
"Classic old favorite. The price is a bit much, but bringing a game like this back to life makes it worthwhile."
"Fantastic game, love what they've done with it, except for the changes they made to the shortcuts."
I may be a little biased here because it waas a game from my childhood however if you like strategy it is a fun game you dont have to wait for the opposing team to finish what you want to do since it is not a turn based game which i enjoy however if you dont like quick games or long battles for key points on the map do not play this game since you have mini skirmishes sometimes however i enjoy the fact that you have to use strategy to kill certain types of units for instance horsemen kill pikemen so i give this a an 'A-ok'
worked for a wile now game wont open 
its age of empires with higher pop cap what more do you want 
"Great game, while not too dissimilar from other RTS in terms of gameplay. The variety of civilizations, game modes, maps and playstyles that this game provides makes it an instant classic. Whilst the graphics are not up to pay by even today's lower tier computers, no other civilization RTS has comes close. 8/10."
"This game is the game i base all rts games on. It is exactly like the old one, but with more gameplay, better graphics, and a community to back it. I definitely recommend!"
One of the most beloved RTS games of my generation. Defiantly pick this up
Great Game So many good Memorys love the new hd textures
gr8 game to play and have a lot of fun playing it
Still the best! &lt;3
Glory of the old days.
Great classic game that will never get old!
"If you are a fan of the original AoE2. You should definitely get this game! The updated graphics and widescreen support are much welcomed, plus the graphics keep the original nostaligic feel, while at the same time update it to this HD era.  Plus the MP works like a charm!"
This is an amazing game! -amazing water -better graphics -amazing expansion packs -new fire the water looks like it is from age of empires 3! the new expansion packs are awseome too! this game is great I recommend it to any person whos into RTS's 
Age of Empire II is one of my favourite games and the best strategy game I've ever played. Mostly because AoE was the first computer game I played.     Wololo is love. Wololo is life.
Classic.
WOLOLO!  Comverted to AOE player.
I love this game^^ played so much nonsteam but steam is ok to
I think I'm in love again.
"The African Kingdoms expansion pack is okay-ish, it's basically new units, new civilisations, and voice acting.   "
"Overwhelmed the entirety of Scandinavia, the European parts of Russia and the Baltic States with an army of 375 Elite Tarkans and managed to slow down the framerate to 20 fps, while the average is over 1200... I won, of course.  10/10 would demolish everything again.    And apparently not even a GTX 970 can run this game at over 60fps at all times o.o"
dont buy this unplayable lagging mess.
An absolute classic! Must play!
"1v1 m8, ill fookin bash ur ead in wid me magudi, ur tootin nites aint got nuthin on gengas kars"
"I have played the Age of Empires series since I was six. I've played Age of Empires One, Age of Empires Two, Age of Empires Three and then finally age of Empires Two HD Edition. I've also played Age of Mythology, and probably sunk a good few thousand hours in across the whole series.  Age of Empires 2 HD Edition is not exactly a HD edition. The game would probably be better named if they just called it 'Steam Edition' in my honest opinion. Rather than just sticking the game on steam and leaving it at that, they also added two new expansions - the African expansion and the Forgotten expansion.  It looks the same as it did before, with new textures for expansion units and buildings. The game sounds pretty much the same too. The gameplay is unaltered as well, so for all intents and purposes this is a repurchase of the old game with steam functionality including achievments, mod support and the expansions - which are the selling points you should focus on, if you're comparing this game to the old one.  The expansions are definately worth it. While i've run into some inexplicable performance issues as of the African expansion, the units, buildings, and civs are definately worth the purchase. The campaigns are... hit and miss, but they're generally pretty alright.  The mods for this game are amazing. Ozhara is definately one to check out if you're interested in exploring and looking at excellent texture and sound upgrades to the game.  As for the achievments... well, i'd honestly say some of the achievments are a little silly, such as losing 50,000 buildings, and winning 100 games with each faction. Now, it did use to be a LOT worse - you used to be able to need to win 1000 games with each civ to get all the cheevs, which thankfully was removed.  All-In-All this game is definately worth the money to purchase it now. The steam implimentation and support for mods, achievments and expansions makes this a solid purchase and a solid, fun experience. Would highly reccomend."
"If you liked the original AoE II and basically want to replace that game with a slightly better copy (because your CD is gone or wont work), then this is for you.  If you want something different from AoE II, then don't get this because its basically the same.   I used my AOE II CD to play this game on and off on various computers for the last 15 years or so, starting as a kid. When I tried to use it on Windows 8.2, it was no longer compatible so I bought this. I'm happy with it because I would have been happy just to play from the old CD I got in the '90s, but my only curiousity is that this 'AoE II HD' appears to be exactly the same as the origial AOE II. Unless my memory is failing me, everything looks exactly the same. They did add some options and clarify some writing in the random map set up, and now I can easily play multiplayer. And I can add free new graphics through community-made add ons. They said they improved the AI. But yeah, other than those things, not much changed, which is fine with me but some people might be expecting something new.  As far as the game itself goes, I've enjoyed this game for a long time. Theres a lot of creative strategies you can make with it (although the army and war based strategies are more robust and varied than more peaceful ones) and a long list of maps types and civilizations that add a lot of spice to your tactics. These sort of 2D graphics arent terrible but theyre not going to really impress compared to the modern 3D endless camera angles style of many games, but this game isnt really about graphics (although some of the community-made stuff is pretty beautiful). It's about strategy, building economy, reliving historial battles, and maybe going head to head with your friends in online multiplayer (or working together as allies to bring down random strangers from across the world lol). Its fun, and replayable. There's a reason I keep coming back to this game for the last decade and a half. :)"
"what can I say that hasn't been said?, I love this game since I was a kid. I really recommend it."
Most Epic game of the century !
"Buy aoe2, then completes the age of king campagin. ☑  I believe that I can trash some noobs, so I decide to try multiplayer. ☑  Looks in lobby and sees a room for noobs only. ☑  Join the match and gets owned by noobs. ☑  Gets called a noob. ☑  10/10 would get called a noob agian."
"Grew up playing this game and have loved every second of it. One of my all time favourite games, love the gameplay, the art is amazing, I love everything about this game. For how old this game is its absolutly amazing. 10/10"
"Really good, upgraded AI, resolution support and easy online play. Awesome."
Best classic RTS game &lt;3
A recreation of the EPIC AoE2. made bigger and meaner with expansion and pop cap increase. get a good 30+ hours back on it
"Loving it! After all the patches, finally works great."
"Basically an all out war game, very fun to build up your army and crush your opponents. The game is difficult at first but once you learn how to play its amazing!"
"loved this game 15 years ago, still love it now, buy it, you won't regret it."
"If you are an old fan of age of empires 2, you should know that this updated edition does not change the game besides for updating the resolution and implementing a much easier to use multiplier system. I would definitely recommend this game to old and new fans alike, as it is one of best, if not the best real time strategy game ever made. The one major problem i have is that this edition does not support local LAN play. This is troublesome, as my internet service can get knocked out, and I am thus unable to play against a friend with LAN. I wish they would fix this...but otherwise, this is an amazing, must buy game!"
The ♥♥♥♥
Good fun game if your by your self even better with friends
"A classic, I was so excited to see this reach the steam marketplace so that I could relive its glory once again! This is the greatest RTS of all time."
"Many happy childhoods were forged by this game. Great game, Great community."
"It's the same great experience, only now it supports high resolutions without a problem. I was just a kid when it was first released and playing it again brings back many fond memories. The addition of steam workshop is great. New content via DLC helps revive this classic.  Of course there are some problems and the most noteworthy issues are:  1- The same bugs that existed with the original version are carried over to the HD Edition as well. You'd think 15 years are enough to solve evey bug in the game but clearly they didn't even attempt to do so.  2- On my QHD monitor, the UI scaling is very poor and the icons and fonts are sharp but very small. I have tried fiddling with every scaling option in Windows or the GPU drivers and the sacling hasn't improved at all  3- Old saves from the original game can't be loaded because they cause the game to crash.  4- Enabling or disabling Vsync causes the game to crash  5- The game can suddenly crash without a known reason during gameplay. Make sure you save FREQUENTLY."
3 hours roll by pretty quickly.
Really good nostalgia. Can be a little slow after populations start to grow (around 500 mark). But otherwise awesome.
"Come on. It's mother-frickin Age of Empires II! Any guy who grew up with strategy games must've at least played this. A timeless classic which has elements that surprisingly hold up to this day. Sure the isometric view has it's quirks like weird wall and gate placements, but this game is pretty damn fun. Picked it up on sale for cheap so I can't argue value wise. One thing to note is the finicky nature of the game itself. Sometimes it refuses to start while at other times getting online is a chore. But once you get in man oh man. Nostalgia.  And yes. I've played enough of it over the years (and finally on Steam) to have heard all 12 or so of the soundtrack enough to know their tunes. And props to that kickass theme.  And developers you cheeky bunch. Releasing a DLC after ALL THESE YEARS. Major props. Might pick it up soon. Ah well. Hope my farms don't run out again."
"I loved it growing up and the steam reboot is nice, good to play with a few friends!"
It's the classic game back and looking better than ever. Still the same great game I remember. My only wish is that the developers would have tried to optimize the game more to take advantage of modern gaming rigs.
This game brings so many good and bad feelings back to my memory.  Definetly worth every penny.
A very cool game that I like to play a lot and lose all the time :C
The best game ever!
Been [playing this medieval since 07'
"Great experience, works great at 3440x1440 right out of the box. Great single player or multiplayer experience. Any fan of RTS games, this is a must have."
"really nice game, I like it"
"when i was child i love watching my father playing this game, and when i watch my father playing this game im really really exited. one time my father teach me how to play AOE 2 and im very very happy and im addicted to this game. and this game makes me remember when i was child and play this game about 8+ hrz everyday until my father not allowed me to play any game on his PC because im abandonning my homework study and even eat.   well this game you can called it MASTER PIECE  #sorry for bad english xD"
"Just buy it. Stop reading the reviews, get your wallet and buy this game already.  ~I know you know what game this is so why are you still reading this. ~you can always read the reviews while downloading it. ~This is a classic that has been improved, you dont see many perfect classic games become more perfect. ~Buy it!   11/10"
Wololo. that is all
"Age of Empires II was one of the first RTS games that I played so it has a special place in my heart. This release on STEAM is incredible. I've had this game for quite some time and they just released a brand new DLC package a few days ago. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Age of Empires and Age of Mythology as well as games like Rise of Nations, although that game is its own animal. The entire experience is one of a kind and will always be a great part of RTS gaming history"
"it's age of empires ii but with graphics fixes and workshop mods, you know what you're getting."
"I loved this game when it first came out...I could be found saying 'wololo' at my cat tring to get it to come to me, or at my parents trying to get them to let me play for just a couple min more...but alas, my skills were no match for them. So i changed my shirt to their color and everything worked out for the better.  10/10 Great Memories and Great fun."
"One of the best RTS games ever, exactly the same as in 1999."
strategy classic 7.5/10
GET IT
i've played this game for over a decade i plan to play it for decades to come 
"Played it as a kid, its the same game."
10/10 woukld revir again
"Its a great game, watch some videos if you dont know how to play it, I have a mate that learned me the game so i was lucky. If was so worth buying it."
Grew up with this game so my review is probably skewed a bit The new DLC brings new life to this classic title. the A.I has gotten smarter over the years  All in all a fantastic remaster.
"If you like RTS, this game is the SH!T. Castles, towers, boats, fuggin sheep yea"
When will the mod where all workers(villangers) are black??
Classic. Recomend.
A classic remains a classic.
"One of the best real-time strategy games ever. 9.5/10. It loses half a point for having a narrator with the worst Scottish accent ever (yes, even worse than Mel Gibson's)."
"Should you buy this game? Well let's see, you can: - See where all of your enemies are, in a spy-like NSA fashion, with the Spies technology - Bomb your opponents walls with long-range Trebuchets - Convert enemies to your cause with monks - Forget to look after your farms and find EVERY LAST ONE expired... - Build trade carts and ships to expand your empire - Seek and defend resources around the map - Send hordes of Paladins and Onagers to crush your enemies   10/10 Will Play Again"
"played the game ages ago and discovered it again today on steam - got hooked up immediately again, still a great game..."
"Age of Empires 2 is time tested, and refined through bloodshed. 16 years old and still an amazing realtime-stratagy. As of this review AOE2 is a solid RTS and one of the best ever made off of a CD.  Now I with that aside... I have some issues with the 'HD Edition'. When this game relaunched in 2013 it was buggy, poorly optimised and ran like crap. My computer couldn't run a 16 year old game because it was taking up to much RAM! It took the developers almost a year to fix the game. It was disappointing and poorly managed. I was sad that I had wasted money on my childhood game, and I had told all of my friends 'AOE2 is back!' * Whisper * but it was  CRUD .   After they fixed it the game was playable and I can injoy it, but Hidden Path Entertainment, Ensemble Studios and Microsoft Studios messed up big time, and next thing they make I am going to check into before I go for it."
"Great game, played this game since I was very little and I still play it to this day. The expansion packs are making it more interesting and fun to play since not all the different nations look exactly the same as well for a couple units."
it really keeps my jimmies from being rustled 10/10  would buy again 
"After playing 500 hours, I realised that AoE2 HD is a terrible remake, so many bugs, even well over two years after its release. Instead of fixing problems they release a new paid DLC. Just get the original version."
Its Age of empires. Would you expect less ? So cut the crap and buy it already.
"This is awesome! Now they need to get all of the classics that run like crap and get them right as rain again, like sacred gold."
Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Or to quote 'Space Quest 3' (which you should also get from steam) 'Hours of fun for the whole family!'
its good
"Because this game never gets old after playing it for over 10 years.   Any fan of AOE2 should consider checking out the HD version + the two new expansions. New civilizations, new campaigns, and new units breaths life back into a classic. Some of the campaigns for the Forgotten Empires were a little glitchy at times (so save often!), but I appreciated that the game developers tried to incorporate some new elements into them (e.g., more stealth-based objectives -- who doesn't like being surreptitious?). That, and I finally get to play as the Poles (well, the Slavs) and that made me happy to no end."
Childhood reborn.
Still the best AoE
"Everytime I play, I lose to Tyler, whether or not he's in the game."
Stil in love with this game!
"This game is AWESOME!!! I remember playing this years ago, when it was still pretty new. It's just as fun today, and the new expansion packs make it even better! A classic."
I am so happy that they re-released this. I love AOEII but the 98 copy doesn't work right on windows 7 and it's annoying to have to use the virtual machine so this is an awsome upgrade.
Remastered version of the great classic RTS. Well worth the money (if all networking issues have been patched)...
"Age of Empires 2 is an awesome game, the HD remake is poopy pooness and lags like a poo face....and the game has had multiple patches that have broken the game and stopped matches from launching...but people play CBA so yay.    Still poopy though"
been playing this since i got it for my sixth birthday then didnt play it for 5 years then i found this i is beautiful and everthing it used to be and more absalutely love it!!!!!
Probably best strategy game ever C:
it's just like age of empires 2 but lags alot not just in multiplayer but also in singleplayer 10/10 
10/10
For my childhood memories
"This game is just as good as the original CD version. It is only missing LAN support. If you played this as a kid, do youself a favor and get this game and the expansions. It's lots of fun!"
  i love this game i played this game when i was like 7 (im 12 now) and its still one of my favorite games cant wait to play it more
"  As a little child I had the demo version, and with my brother, we always played the Wallace campaign 7th map. I always wanted to make 'snipers'(Longbowman), and wanted to be as Red player (cuz they were always badass Britons).  Lot of fun, this game was my childhood (with many others). I guess everybody have his childhood story with this game. This game is immortal, this game is history, and now after a lot of years, it's time to become better in multiplayer (ofc with the red longbowmen :) ."
First PC game i ever played when i was young at a friends house. The memories of re-playing this game is very fun and will still continue to play.
Best game rated 10/10
Brings back the nostalgia of playing this when it first released!
"Best strategic game in history with awesome graphical remake. Enjoyable gameplay, civilizations, maps, including much better AI.  ∞/10 purchase"
"The game is as good as ever, and the new campaigns are well done. The convenience of the steam platform for matchmaking is a big selling point."
"One of the best games of all times in my opiniion, but if I think it through I like a lot of games."
"Childhood game, definitely the second best strategy game ever. (After Red Alert 2, it has a speciall place in my heart =D)"
  Basically the same background story as any other review for this game
"I'm so glad I don't need to look at pixels anymore from the disc I bought 10 years ago :') If you love setting up a village (food, stone, wood,..) If you love getting you're army ready and upgrading it, with a lot of variety.. This is your game!"
"The best real-time strategy game of it's time and one of the best to this date, AoE2 HD brings enhanced visuals and content to this installment of the series, including all expansions, new content and a revived multiplayer system. This game has more content and gameplay options than the sequel, Age of Empires 3, but has dated graphics and a bit worse AI. This game is historically accurate, riddled with customization, has mod support and an unforgettable soundtrack. If you like RTS games, this game will not disappoint you."
I would reccomend this game to anyone into this sort of stuff its by far the best age of empires out there i play pretty much ever day recently doesnt get old :) worth the money
"My villagers started uprising due to lock of pay a poor working conditions, causing a civil unrest and forcing me to resign.  10/10 would play again."
Teamed up with the Japanese while playing as the Chinese. 10/10.
"Loved AOE, shame Microsoft didn't support it after MSN games network stopped. Really appreciated playing this classic again."
"Good game with many hours of play time.   I play with friends as I don't really like the campaign, but you might :)"
I love this game. Played it everyday as a kid.
After only about three hours of playtime I can already see the improvements made to this game. The graphics were beautifully redone and the AI is vastly improved.
"This game is pure nostalgia, if you never played it before it might be difficult to enjoy. It hasn't aged all that well but its still very fun especially the multiplayer. Get it right now while its on sale if you mean to."
Played since I was about 7 or 8 and still love to play it especially againist other people online were every person fights differently unless you play the deathmatch gamemode. LOL
it blows pp
"i'm rather new to the steam community but this game is quite fun and interntaining. the game has severe different modes and ways to play it but i believe the best and most atractive part is its multiplayer, you can play with your friends,against , or split into teams."
"Edit:  Second day playing and constanty getting an out of sync error with a friend.  Both of us are reinstalling the game now. If it persists I will have to change my positive raiting. :(  As you can see my hours aren't up yet, but i've played this game since I was a kid.   I still have the game but lost the CD key and am glad it's gone on sale. Now I will never lose it. :D   Totally worth playing.   If it does't support online play I will be changing this review a little bit though. ;)"
"One of the best strategy games even now ! i enjoy it a lot, it is worth every penny !  "
really really good &lt;3
""
One of the greatest games of all time.
Same game as before but just works better on a modern PC. Some of the controls are still as stubborn as they were before. HD does not appear to any any better visual effects.
Still as good as it ever was.
I think this is a very cool and fun game and I recommend it to other people that like basebuilding and history.
"It's everything Age of Empires II was, and a little more... now I just gotta find me some crazy custom maps."
"First of all Age of Empires 2 is THE BEST rts game ever created period. I remember back in the days I used to play this when I was a kid on my potato computer with a huge *** sony trinitron monitor. Times were good back then. But Im glad they brought it back with a HD remake. There are a lot of bugs mostly in multiplayer but I wont list them since I mostly play the single player and multiplayer back in the day was dificult to set up and to come by. I also appreciate the devs for updating this game with new DLC. The fact that this game came out around 1999, its mind blowing that they were able to revive this game with new DLC. Unlike command and conquer and all those other RTS games, this game helped me pass World History! This game is a textbook for world history. Last of all Wololo."
"After playing this game, I only have two words: cheesesteak jimmy's"
The greatest game of all time
"yes, but never take me to the first time when i played the original version of this game."
Solid and intuitive RTS that should be the first port of call for beginners to the genre. Just remember: you can never have too many villagers early game.
"This game is really fun, but it is really hard! Even so, it is a real nostalgic treat :- )"
"Just like the original, but in HD!"
love this game
"This is as great as I remembered! I've spent all my teens playing Age of Empires games, and to be able to play it once again is just great. Really excited to play also 'The Forgotten'."
Best RTS ever! Would buy again.
"Best Stretagy Game Out Ther, specially that is in HD now and with workshop :D Give it go, if you are looking for a good RTS game, AOE-HD its the one i highly recommend.  Its not 'next-gen' graphics, because its a old game remastered, but thers no doubt its very good.  9/10"
This is a great game. Lots of enhancements to the original.
"If you liked the original AoE 2, you should probably buy this. It's that simple really; there's nothing special about this version except for the HD part.  A solid 8/10, because it's Age of Empires 2, a great strategy game both for its time and today."
"For those of you who miss the old times, and want to keep LANning old-style. Multi issues resolved (ooooohw, yeah !), graphics ameliorated (slightly)."
It's the original AoE II only better. Better graphics and total fidelity to the things that made AoE amazing the first time. Can't recommend enough.
love this game
I love this game. I've played it ever since I was a kid! Now it's on steam and even better cause MODS :D
HD remake of the greatest RTS ever. This makes me beyond happy.
"I love this game, it brings me good memories Recommended!"
this game came out when i was 4. i still play it.
Same game as before only easier to play with friends now
If you are a fan of the original this is a must buy!
"Great Game, Great Times, Great Remake Expansions are good, Steam compatibility with Mods and workshop stuff is great.. So everything is made the way it should be. 10/10 would buy again"
My most favorite game series for a all time strat game. Don't make the map ludicrous. Giant is big enough with little to no issues. I have like two copy's of the non HD one on CD. But I been playing this game for about 5 years now.
How can I get my money back?
"It is and will always be, the best strategy game of all time!"
"It's very hard for me to recommend the game. This isn't because it's bad, but because it's nothing new. They like to brag about the updated and modern graphics/textures, but those screenshots were taken zoomed very far out. Even the old version would look good zoomed out. The AI is the same, attack move wasn't updated to be like modern RTS, and everything else is flat out the same. If I were to recommend it, I would only do so because it's 'updated' to work on modern OS's and there is renewed multiplayer. I have to say it is only worth it on sale, and will not be worth full price based on the little 'improvements' it has been given.  EDIT: I'm going to come back and change this recommendation for the sake of giving credit where it is due. I've got almost 40 hours into this bad boy and still no crashes/glitches/problems. I'll also mention that this game comes with an expansion on top of a new campaign already different from the original game. That said, there is even a new expansion coming out (African Kingdoms). This game is gettnig the treatment that I wish Age of Mythology was getting, but I cannot in my mind not recommend a game that's supported so much. It's not even expensive.  P.S. We still have the crappy attack moves. They're useless."
Always loved Age of Empires and HD verision breaths life into this classic. :) would highly recommend.
"Something is wrong with the new expansion though. I cannot start the game, it crashes every single time. It used to work just fine before I bought the african expansion. Any tips ?"
"Revival of my childhood, I'm not a good player of this game, but I love every second of it.  Pros: Playing with friends and offers a lot of fun for a very old game, awesome dlc.  Cons: howdoyouturnthison don't spawn cars anymore.  This game is a must have, the best of its genre."
This is a great plan game. and if you know some one who don't like it go wololo on them it should fix the problem
Back to childhood.
One of the best games ever!!!!!
10 Years now :D I love it (Y)
"BEST GAME EVER.  Age of Empires II is one of the greatest RTS games of all time, it features great strategic gameplay and a good deal of historically acurate information."
HANDS DOWN WORTH THE MONEY. IF I WAS A CASTAWAY ON A ISLAND AND COULD ONLY HAVE ONE GAME IT WOULD BE THIS! (MERE CAPS CAN NOT CONTAIN THE PURE AWESOMENESS THAT IS AOE!)
10/10 would wololo again
Ate my life when I was younger. Just as awesome as it was. Get it.
Amazing game!! specially for those of us that had hours of fun years ago when it was new.
"My favourite game, and the best RST game that it's out there and will ever be! Fun and full of adrenaline moments in the game (specially in the multiplayer). You easily learn to play it, but it takes pratice to master it! I STRONGLY recommend it! Best game ever! c: &lt;3"
"From my experience, this has been the best A0E title. I've played every release and none even come close. Even with it's dated graphics this game is a 10/10 from me."
"Good game, fun to play."
omfg finally *-*
This series is one of my favorite and playing in HD is even better. I'd highly recommend buying it espically for this $4 sale!
"I'm changing this review and retracting every good thing I've said about this game. Microsoft has shown with the newest expansion that it doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore and simple wants to milk the money out of wallets for a buggy, unfinished and clearly made cash cow DLC expansion. Avoid this game like the plague, buy the original version instead of this pathetic garbage."
Love this game the onld version is awesome and now in HD makes it so much better
"Like many others who have reviewed this game it holds sentimental value to me being the first computer game i ever purchased and played, and now i can play it again in HD!! The joy and memories, not to take away the fact that it's a great RTS in its own right.   Now i just need to remember how to play again......I had it down to a science, must be getting old."
Worst game I've ever played. Anyone who buys this game after reading this has a ♥♥♥♥ up their ♥♥♥. What the hell were the developers thinking?
"Age Of Empires was my first game, and after more than one decade, I am still playing it. Buy it. Love it."
"Entirely unplayable game due to extreme lag, fps drops, and glitchiness. May the utmost shame be upon the developers of this 'HD' remake and anyone else involved in it's release. The developers of this release should give everyone their money back for this scam game and should be banned from having any games puchaseable on Steam. The thought that I almost paid the full price for this game makes me sick. This game has been out for two years now and the multiplayer is still entirely unplayable and the developers have NOT acknowledged or addressed the problem or given any remorse for their blatant problems. They expect us to port foward to try and address the issues? Really? Guess what, it doesn't help at all. This is a nostalgic money-trap that took everything that worked in the original game and made it worse. Buy the actual game instead and save yourself the trouble."
"Love this game! I used to play it all the time back on an old Pentium III PC, or, I played the original. I didn't play AoE II until 2008, but it is still a great game! Plus, it's been remastered in HD AND now it has a much higher NPC limit!  If you're looking for an RTS game to kill some hours, this is the game for you!  Summary:  Gr8 M8 I R8 8/8."
The best game of all time is back in 1080p! Need I say more?
"Aoe2 is the best game but its also the worst because you can never play as it lags and drops out all the time, impossible too play."
"AoE II is a 1999 2D isometric RTS game that marked an era on the RTS genre and this new version, luckily, just revamps it with widescreen/HD patches, a few bugfixes, reworked water/effects and steam workshop integration.  While widescreen/HD graphic support was a must have and there was no actual need for water or effects reworks, steam workshop integration is what makes this new version worth buying. On the workshop you're able to mod almost every part of the game, this increases even further the decennial longevity of this game. A few examples of currently available steam workshop items are: complete texture packs, water/coast mods, entire campaigns, extremely well made maps, ...  So, game system is exactly how AoE II was, one of the best ones ever among RTS games, extremely balanced and quite various, with slight but substantial differences between civilizations.  Graphic is good, not what you would expect from a 2013 game but strictly speaking about the HD port quality I couldn't think of any way it could have been done better.  Music got some nice remixes, most of them made it sound more 'medieval', which as far as I'm concerned it really nice.  In the end I'd say that even at full price (which is maybe 30%~35% more than you may expect from an HD port of a 10+ year old game) I'd recommend buying this game, mostly because of steam workshop integration that really made (and still makes) the difference on my gameplay experience."
"Great game, deep strategy envolved, not friendly for the casual if playing online. Might be a bit old, but it's a great game. The online works horribly bad, it's not optimized correctly and people cause out of sync when they are about to loose.  9/10 for the game, 3/10 for a horrible remake, only things changed are textures and resolution. Other than that the game still have as many issues as the old  Zone.com  version."
A game from my teen years that keeps on bringing back good memories.
It was k?
"Age of Empires II really is a classic. Even afte playing the more modern versions (Age of Mythology, Age of Empires III) and other similar games (Rise of Nations, The Settlers) I still enjoy this game. I think it is it's simplicity which makes it such a joy to play. I also really like all of the different cultures which have their own unique units and building styles."
Best strategy game all of the time
"Age of Empires was the first game I got into as a child. It helped me through my studies, it helped me appreciate and understand History in a way that no other medium ever did and till this day I play the entire series even if I have to ISO it to play it! HD truly brought back my childhood and allowed me to enjoy new content that until now, I was previously unable to! Thank you HD team! :)"
Waist of ♥♥♥♥ing money the campaign progress keeps resetting and appearently im not the only one with this problem.
"This was my old review:  Very disappointing! Loved the original and was excited for some nostalgia gaming, but instead the program fails with an error every time. Claims that my system's GPU does not meet minimum requirements, which is absurd given it is using a newer nvidia card that runs much newer games with ease. Very shoddy work.  However, with recent updates it's now able to play on the same system. It's a major nostalgia trip to play this. If you were into this game the first time around, go for it. If this is your first time, some of it will probably seem primative. It's like watching old 'I love lucy' episodes. The stuff that seems old and tired now was slick and new when this came out."
"Great game, it costs a bit for how old it is but still very fun."
Ahh the memories
Constantly Multiplayer out of sync....out of sync....what a waste of my time
"EDIT 11/11/2015: Following the recent release of The African Kingdoms, most of the problems I had experienced in the earlier builds of the game have been improved. As of now, this is indeed the definitive edition of Age of Empires II, and is worth purchasing at a 25-50% discount, wherever applicable.  Be warned, however. The multiplayer is still rather capricious. Good frame rates and solid connectivity are subject to a coin flip. Sometimes it's good, other times it's not. If you're into multiplayer, I would still recommend purchasing an older copy of the Gold Edition and finding alternate means of playing online.  However, for a single-player gamer like myself, there's enough here to keep one occupied for dozens of hours. As such, Age of Empires II HD Edition gets a thumbs-up from me.   ORIGINAL REVIEW:   Age of Empires II currently stands as my favourite RTS game of all time.  The HD edition has, sadly, soured the very legacy it created back in the late nineties.  It still retains the fantastic basic gameplay that all RTS nuts came to love about the game back during its early years; easy to learn RTS mechanics that are still involving and challenging enough for veterans of the genre to sink their fangs into. The AI is still a blast to face off against, even if it does become somewhat predictable after a while. The palette of grainy 2D textures are still quite charming to look at and the fantastic single-player campaigns - ranging from Joan of Arc to Attila the Hun - are still there and work just as brilliantly as ever.  So why was I disappointed with this modern update of the game? Here's why:  1. Widescreen Edition. That's what the subtitle of this should have been called to begin with. No remarkable updates to the 2D visuals, save for a few fancy-looking water and fire effects, have been added. While you can argue that this is an HD upgrade and not a remake, a 1080p upgrade with some very minor graphical upgrades is not enough. More effort could have been put into sharpening the overall colour palette of the game, alongside some work on smoothing out the units' animation. However, Hidden Path has made no such effort.  2. Frame-rate issues still persist, despite the number of recent patches. I have a €1000+ machine that can run the likes of Shogun 2 and Crysis 3 on high settings, yet frame-rate drops persist on my machine whenever more than eighty units take up the screen in AoE II HD. I shouldn't expect performance issues in an HD upgrade of a fourteen-year-old game.  3. Multiplayer is still largely unplayable; despite the patches. I've logged on around two hours of online multiplayer with AoE II HD. Bear in mind that I bought this several months after its release, so for me, at that stage, to encounter incidents involving absurd amounts of lag and being booted from games is utterly unacceptable. The addition of multiplayer through Steam's servers was one of the main selling points of the HD edition. For connection and server reliability issues to persist despite several months of patching is a sign of a developer putting in the bare minimum of work necessary to keep its customers satisfied.  4. Taking a popular mod, changing absolutely nothing, and having the nerve to put it up on Steam and charge money for it. I purchased The Forgotten in the hope that it would add a bit of extra stability to the multiplayer, but I was completely wrong. Forgotten Empires is the biggest update this amazing game has received in several years. For you to take it and just slap a price tag on it (without adding anything such as voice acting for the new campaigns) is once again a sign of lacklustre effort on the developer's part.  Other issues, including unorthodox key bindings and a lack of AI tweaking, also plague the game, but the four major flaws above should be enough to show that this HD Edition is purely lazy in just about every aspect. It is basically the original RTS we adore, tarnished by several layers of performance issues and worthless resolution stretching, the rotten cherry on top being Microsoft’s immoral decision to use a modder's work in a very selfish attempt to siphon more money off the franchise’s fans.  I don't hate AoE II HD. I am, however, disappointed with it, and feel as if I would have been much better off hunting down a Gold Edition of AoE II and downloading the necessary mods from there on in.  I rate AoE II HD a 5/10.  If you’re like me and have no access to an original copy of AoE II and are desperate to get back into the nostalgic euphoria of playing a classic RTS, AoE II HD isn’t a bad buy. If you already have a disc copy of AoE II and its expansion, stick to that and find alternate means to play online."
An awesome HD rendition of a cult classic. New working MP servers and continued support via expansions is just the icing on the cake!
"I used to play this with a CD Rom when I had windows 8, but this version is a lot better. Got it for 4 euros on a Steam Sale ( 80 % off!!!!) and it's really an amazing game. If you have 2 or 3 hours to spare at the end of a day or on a weekend, spend it on a game of Age of Empires. If you like strategy games, buy this game.  If you like building virtual empires, buy this game. If you like waging war against friends and AI buy this game. I also own Age of Empires III, and it is even better than this one... I fully recommend both of these games, they both have different strategies for you to win. I also recommend Civilization V, it is a more realistic version of the Age of Empires saga, and matches can last more than 20 or 30 hours."
Great RTS. Well done.
"A really good RTS game. It is a good purchase if you never played it back in the days, but there is not much new feature and the graphic update is far from impressive. If you own the game in CD version but can't play it because of compatibility issue try to buy the game during a special offer with all DLC included for a low price."
After so many years this game is still fun ;)  Pros:  - Updates! - Workshop - Epic gameplay - Many more!  Cons: - Haven't found one.  
i need Controller :( to play this RTS like on PS2 to spare my time until 250 hours
Beautiful HD upgrade. Has aged very well from it's initial release.
if ur stuck in the stonage ull liek it lol
Best game of my childhood. 10/10 would play again.
"Once lived mighty warrior king. Every hes command where law Hes worst command where 'Collect every berry you will find and then eat them and make me more peasants. And you horsemen go and find me sheep.We eat them too and make more peasants and some of them we will make our eyes and spies and let them draw map for us. Sorry sir but sheep cant draw maps and spy enemies. Yes they can and never again wont argue with me. Yes Sir. Time passed and all berries where gone and mighty warlord gives new orders 'My people' You shall cut down every mother f--ing tree in this world and build a lot of farms then we will be going to new are in history'. And people followed hes leaders command.But some time later Horseman came back 'Sir we have news for you. We know now where our enemies live thanks for sheep. But we have also some bad news. They took over some of our sheep and now they spy for them.' Ok kill every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sheep you will see for revenge and betrayal.   Now my followers we need even more wood and food to go to another area and you stupid peasant go and collect every stone and gold you found in this world Yes Sir Now in third are we can make even more peasants we will be rich soon. But sir our sheep spies reported enemy have big army and its moving here we have only peasants. No problemo we hide into this building where all our peasants are made and shoot them to death. And so it happened,enemy troops where shoot to death and mighty warrior king where once again big hero. But story wont end here. My people we will build now very big army. thousand of men walking side by side and killing every enemy on sight. Sir we cant do that Why??? WHO SAYS THAT The God Sir WHOS THIS GOD ??? Microsoft Sir - Only 500 men in each nation can walk on this planet. OH CRAP. Ok hundreds of men walks side by side and killing every enemy on sight Sir we still have problem. We already have over 400 peasants chopping down wood and farming for food. Stupid God but ok first of all lets kill hundreds of peasants and then make big army. Everyone in shining armor and with horses. OK Sir And then we will conquer the world But Sir enemies have stone walls and archers and catapults and some sweet talking guys named monks. They will talk with our soldier to be on their side. Dosnt matter we will outnumber them and we will hit those stone walls with our swords so hard they will BURN IN FLAMES and only ASH will cover their dead bodies and VICTORY will follow us."
"AoE2 let me count the ways. Such a fun game you can sink countless hours in both off and online. Aside from a couple historical inaccuracies and hiccups you are well worth the money. A rich map and scenario creating system, different european, asian and american races to choose from  Just two tiny pet peeves of mine: - you started out on windows xp... and then the creators decided in all their wisdowm to throw that OS a middle finger. Smooth. - despite how much you want to cram hussars as a 'light cavalry' unit. They're not. That is the most egregious sin I have seen in a video game let alone one that tries to be historically accurate. Shame on you."
It has teutonic knights  10/10
This game has been a favorite of mine for years. My younger brothers encouraged me to put this on my wishlist and grab it when it went on sale...I did. This game does not let me down. My favorite additions with the Steam download are the achievements and being able to easily play with my family. I would encourage anyone who had fun with this game in their past to pick it up again here on Steam and give it another play through.
"Great game, not the best remake, unstable multiplayer, but it's still AOE 2"
"easily my favorite RTS game of all time. I played the original prob 5,000+ hours and now that I have the HD + 2 brand new expansions lets factor in additional 5,000 hours. the new AI in HD edition is tough and unforgiving adding an entire new demension of play.   10/10 would wololo again."
Awesome to play with friends. A bit less awesome to play alone.
"With such a classic RTS game, it's quite hard to go wrong. Despite one or two crashes, the game remains very playable, with a still active community. Fun and challenging Civilisations provide many different styles of play. The AI can be quite competent, but I feel the difficulty curve between Normal and Easy might be a bit too high. Still fun, and with a well designed GUI, this is certainly worth getting - I'd recommend it more if it's on sale. 8.5/10"
A classic RTS that gets even more fun with friends on mulitplayer.
"♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The game crashed on me during a long multiplayer match and when I try to restore the match, nothing happens. I can't resume my multiplayer game, which renders this game absolutely pointless."
"Let's face it: Age of Kings was a terrific game, and this HD update is just as terrific. The missions and AI are a lot harder than I remember, which in my opinion is a great improvement. In my opinion, one of the top 3 RTS computer games of all time."
I feel like I'm playing DLC Quest since I have to pay for DLCs to play default civs.
"Always loved this game. Loads of fun, limitless play."
"last patch/DLC broke the want to play the game. did not purchase African content.  -&gt;CANNOT RESTORE GAMES!!!!!&lt;-  would like to post this on a report so the devs can fix this but forum is unavaible, so will wave off folks that remember the awsome old game it was."
"Probably the greatest game that ever was ever made, it is not just a RTS game i mean... you can WOLOLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Age of Empires 2 is seriously one of the best RTS games out there.  The graphics were created via a method similar to Roller Coaster Tycoon, or more notably Donkey Kong Country (pre-rendered 3D models as sprites). The game is a decade old though, so I'm not going to go on about that anymore.  The gameplay is amazing. I've played many RTS games since I was exposed to this one, and none have matched up. It seems simple, but with all the different civs, bonuses, unique units and techs, this game is very deep and complicated.  If you really want to get good at it, you'll have to learn to micro all your units very well, get very good at managing your resources, and learn a bunch about what counters what.  The online is 50/50, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, even when everyone has low enough ping. The dreaded desync is always an issue.  There's a few bugs, and the learning campaign teaches you very little, but manages to drag it out quite a bit.  Other than that, I very highly recommend this game. Wololo"
good game have been waiting for it get better grafix btw i used to play the orriganal
"Best wolololo simulator ever!  (Monks can kill enemies with the POWER OF GOD, how can you say no?)  10/10"
"It's a classic, it's fun, and I enjoy playing with friends."
"You better have a realy good pc to run a random game with 7 other players or bots, because its gonna lagg like crazy, but for some reason, my old pc with the old disc will have no problem. Is the game HD? Well its fullscreen but its only gonna make the game more heavy.  I was lucky to get it for 5$ but I will only be playing big teams on my old version in a none HD and fullscreen resolution. Sometimes im just missing the good old disc that you can buy at your game store for that reason."

"I'm not going to go into depth with this one. The  HD  label is misleading: it's  not  a graphical update of AoEII, but rather a version which simply supports widescreen resolutions up to 1920x1080 and probably higher. This is somewhat a relief in knowing that the gameplay wasn't screwed around with much.  Still, it's AoE, one of the best RTS computer game series ever.  8 out of 10 stars."
It's like my childhood all over again.
"Great game, but definetly shows its age sometimes"
Age of Empires 2 HD is awesome. I played AoE2 many years ago and it's still fun. If you have played this game before so buy it now!
"age old classic + way better graphics = you cant loose, HIGHLY recommended!"
Still a great game. Reminds me of my childhood
It's a ton of fun.
"This is a must have for anybody who ever enjoyed the original version of this game. Its a prefect example of a remake where they haven't improved the graphics that much but rather focused on frame-rate and resolution, the two downfalls of playing any aged game. Its hours of fun and the added material and population cap make the game even better than it was in its prime. 10/10 definitely buy this gem of an RTS"
Remember playing this when it came out and all the Steam improvements really make it worth playing again.
Well worth the price for a longtime fan of the series!
A amazing fastpaced stragty game set in the medevil times. For the more fastpaced stragists who hate the wait of real time stragities or turn takeing games. Deffintly one of the classicas and a fun game for all ages. I give this game a shocking 10/10
"Love this game. Brings back memories from when I was a kid. If you enjoyed it years ago, you'll still enjoy it now. Graphics are moderately better but nothing too special. Highly recommend."
obviously it was good
Great game
"Didn't keep WOLOLO from AoE 1. Ruined the whole game for me, horrible, 1/10. I really like it. 9/10"
Its a fun calssic. I recommend buying it and the expansion when they go on sale.
The RTS that molded a generation of games.
"So glad to see this game on Steam. It's one of the first games I remember playing as a young teen that really got me hooked on gaming. (not to mention all the valuable history. I was probably the only 12 year old that knew what a trebeuchet was).   The game and the graphics may seem dull to those used to playing next gen games, but the simple and addicting gameplay is what keeps me coming back. Easy to learn, and fun to perfect, this is one of the gold standards of RTS games."
"Great game great redone edition. New fans and old will really enjoy this. Workshop minimods can be a nice addition to the game that don't take it far from the core of the game. You get pretty much everything you would want out of an HD release here.  However the state of this game during its steam launch was beyond shameful and poor and not something I will forget. Insane lag and game crashing affected many and ruined the expeirence for some of my friends first time to the aoe2 and had them not wanting to give it another try.  This comes full circle again at the time of writing this with the random crashes the African Kingdoms Expansion has brought about. Two bad launches in a row is very shameful. The DLC however has good content but until the kinks get worn out you can't fully enjoy the content.  I also want to say charging for the forgoten dlc is unethical but that's a whole other topic.   Good game, bad launch history on steam."
"Just as I rememeber it! Classic and prob the best RTS i've ever played. Addictive, fun and easy to play but also a challenge it has the perfect mix and makes you come back for more. Must have played for 1000s of hours when i was younger!"
Spam '30' on lobby Spam '11' when enemy failed to raid
Bought this for my dad and he loves it.  (Maybe because he can kill civilian in this game)
Love it.
Its a great game to play with friends.:)
played MP after a few rounds VS the PC.  Got my ♥♥♥ kicked in 200~ hours worth of rounds.  10/10 would be terrible at game again.
I've only played it for a little bit. The game is pretty decent.
"Best Wolololo Simulator on the market. 9/10 monks recommend this game! No seriously, when I played this game as a kid it was great and it still is. You can't do anything wrong if you spend your money on this game."
Amazing game. One of the few Microsoft classics. I'm surprised this game didn't die out a long time ago
It was so sad when my sheep went into an enemy's territory and defected :(
"If its on steam sale, you can buy it. Otherwise wait.  It fixes some issues and adds workshop support for easier mod installment, but its totally not worth 20 bucks (excluding the DLC)."
One of the best RTS game of all time
the absolute best
A great spin on an old classic.
Classic.... Nostalgic and a challenge.  Childhood games are really hard to beat especially one so historic like this one.
Brings back memories when I played it when it first came out but now it's even better!
"Allahu Akbar. Game has two of best things in war game. Camels and Saracens. Camel good to scare silly horse. Saracens good to scare silly Crusaders. Combination make deadly army.  If you get hump and not like camel then many other unit available. Petard are also good. I make many petard and blow up all markets on map.  Other that Saracen you can be other people like Turks, Persians and Koreans.  Game has a few campaigns to keep you busy but best thing is play online. Then you say 'Monk, I need a Monk' for many hour until no one want to beat you anymore."
"An oldy and a goody!! The AI has been improved also. One of my favourite RTS of all time, and my wifes too."
"I remember in middle school, in one class after we did our work we could play Age of Empires on a LAN server.  Good memories  P.S. Paladins are op and the best units in the game"
Played this game first time 2004... and still I cannot delete this from my computer! 14. Start the game allready! :P
"Never got out-dated and never will. Age of Empires II is by far the most amazing game of the franchise. Simple to learn and hard as hell to master, this game still got an amazing player-base that shows support to their favourite game. Almost full historically accurate, beautiful soundtrack (and classic too) and a gameplay that kicks ♥♥♥! A hard campaign, ranked multiplayer games and a strong AI makes this game a jewel of the RTS genre."
"Best game of it's kind ever made.Exciting,action packed strategy game. Civisilization was never like this."
"Great game, I played the original and I have to say they didn't change too much but still a great game"
No. 1 RTS on my list.
"Growing up as a little kid, I played The First Age of Empires, once I heard about this newer model, I immediatly bought it, and I Love playing this game, Has amazing campaigns and Multiplayer battles. 9/10"
How do you turn this on?
"Age Of Empires - AOE 1 of the best strategy games i ever seen. I cant stop to play this game.palying and playing it over again, i grow up wth this game first time i was playing this game i was 4 years old and now affter 12 years i still playing it microsoft studios got really good work here. recommend this game 100%."
As good now as it was when it was first released. So much fun to play again.
"This was one of my great childhood games that I played. Ever wonder why Walmart still sells this ancient game? Yeah, find out for yourself."
"If you like RTS games then i suggest you buy this game as soon as possible. This game will give you unending hours of fun and challenges. i have now 500 hours of playing and i still can't get enough. Age of Empires II HD has not lost it charm that it had the first time, So if you liked the old one then you'll love the new one.  One critic.The multiplayer server are very dependent on your internet connection. If you have a bad internet connection then you'll struggle in multiplayer because every single person must have a decent connection so that the game doesn't lag."
Playin offline is better than online. Wolololo  8/10
I played this game when it was first released back in 1999 and loved it and im still playing today and its only got better thanks to steam and the Steam community
"Game is very fun, however, I seem to have a problem with lag on my computer with it. No other game I have has lag, and it obviously isn't my computer. I thought maybe my ISP isn't good enough, however, this is the only game I have problems with. The game just seems to be choppy, Not sure what to do. When I first got this game it was absolutely fine. Now it does it even when I play campaign. Not sure what to do to make it better. 9/10 Would be 10/10 but the choppiness really messes with my fun."
"there are no options for screen resolution. on a big monitor the UI is so small thing like resources are illegible , even the building icons are so small its hard to differentiate between them. completly unplayable unless on a small monitor. what a shame there are no scaling options. i am disapointed that i wasted $50 on this game.  would accept refund if offered!!!"
"Had non-steam version, one of the most enjoyable game I've played. More factions, larger population cap, better graphics. "
"Just a must have classic, if you are a fan of oldschool strategic games."
Best game of all time!
Crashes after few seconds of gameplay. What the hell is this.
"Probably one of my favourite games by far, I absolutely love it. It's fun playing both on your own and with others, and with the new AI's its even better. I highly recommend this game, especially if you love strategy games. Each civilization has it's own strengths and weaknesses and so you can learn different strategies depending on which civilization you are.   Everything about this game is perfect, get it. Get it now."
This game will get you super wet
"This game is higly recommended for Strategy, RTS lovers. Only stupid thing is you cant change youre graphics and in the audio option stand: Off and Difficult? Why must the audo be difficulty xD. But this game is awesome. and a other stupid thing is: You game is almost gonna crash from lag if you have like 300population or something xD. But this game get's from me a 9/10."
Every game is like a trip back to 1999
"Age 2 HD does a great job retaining the feel of the original while adding some new and interesting features. I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and will continue to do so for many, many yeaers"
This game is an absolute classic. It may be a little hard for new players to get into - but ask your friends if they've played it before. If you can grab a friend - buy it for sure!
Great update of an old classic.
"Played this game when I was a kid, and its nothing less of a thrill to play it again as an adult. Always something far too satisfying than building up your culture, an watching others burn~"
muh nostalgia tho
"I have enjoyed this game thorroughly since the age of five, while I may not of known what to do, I still found it an enjoyable experience making those dark age warriors and storming the enemy, Now at an older age I know what to do, when to do it and how, this game is an extremely thrilling experience as you will one second be adimiring your economic prowess, and then be raided by scout cavalry the next, as you try and scrabmle a couple of pikeman together, If you have 20 bucks in your wallet, you should by this game, and get some friends together to play it with, I rate 10/10 GG Stars"
"Very nice HD remake, i love playing this with my friends online. i can spend HOURS on this game"
"This was a big nostalgia purchase for me. It captures every ounce of the greatness that I remember so fondly, but with crisper visuals &amp; support for modern resolutions without having to use a mod. Best of all, an update after release also seems to have resolved the crippling performance problems that had always plagued the game when lots of units were on-screen, even on modern PCs. Now it feels buttery smooth."
"This game would be fantastic if a few fixes were made.  First of all, I would like to be able to actually enter a game. All too often the 'Waiting for other players' screen gets stuck and you can't even enter the game.  In-game, everything is great, but it's a matter of ***GETTING INTO*** the actual game. Even on single player games, it waits for other players.  Please fix this issue. I went onto Steam forums and there are no solutions to this to be seen in them.  ***FIX THE PROBLEM SO I CAN ACTUALLY PLAY!!!***"
"Has this game already made history in your life? Then you should definitely play it again.  Has it not? Then... well... you should play it also.  Age of Empires 2 HD is a unique masterpiece, that has been sculpted to made each team have a unique trait, and still everything is balanced enough that you can never be sure what civilization will win.  As many RTSs, this game is about making steady progress, developing accordingly to the game scenario and keeping pressure on your opponents. The wide range of possibilities, creations and strategies may make this the best RTS ever.  9/10"
"Let me start off by saying that Age of Empires II is one of my favorite games of all time.   I never played it as a kid. Matter of fact, a friend of mine bought me a copy of it about 2 or 3 years ago and we played one or two games. It was fun, but I never really picked it back up after that because I didn't think I'd like playing solo.   Fast forward to about 3 or 4 months ago, and I am playing this game nonstop. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it's just the sheer replayability, or if it's the pick up and play style, but this game keeps me entirely entertained for hours a day.   Pros: - Incredibly easy to learn, and you will find yourself getting signifigantly better with each game. - Different every time you play, considering Civ bonuses and random maps - Flawless steam integration - Decently active multiplayer, despite being a decade and a half old - Steam Workshop support - Low-end, so it will run on damn near any machine; no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ your 8 year old compaq is - Just plain fun  Cons: - Graphics are a bit outdated, but there are high-res Texture packs in the workshop that aim to fix that.  - Most popular multiplayer games are against people who are going to be a lot better than you. You will lose. (Better to play with friends if you're new) - Slightly unbalnced civs. Sometimes when you do random civs, you'll get one who's bonus is just trash, so I recommend picking a specific one. (The Huns get +20 production speed on mounted units /winkeyface)   All in all, a fantastic title, worth every penny, and I'd reccomend it as a great start into the RTS world if you've never played; and if you like RTS games, then you propbably already have this game. 9.5/10"
This is and always has been a great game. I grew up with the first one and have always played this one here and there in my childhood. I recently found this game on steam and it has been the best discovery I've found yet on steam. This game is a classic and is even better than I remembered. 100% worth it.
Super fun with freinds and online. Fantastic
My childhood was on sale and I decided to buy it.
"There's not much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. This game was so integral in my childhood that it formed me into the RTS lover that I am today. What's more is that me and my dad used to play against each other over LAN frequently as a kid and I will definitely be buying a copy and making him a steam account so we can relive those old memories over Christmas break this 2015. The only problem I have with this game is the multiplayer can be somewhat laggy, but I find that small delays don't take away from the overall experience and still keep the game amazing like I had once knew it.  9.5 out of 10, love this game to death."
"An excellent game back in the day and an excellent game still, and with the HD remaster it's a definit must have in my opinion, especially if you have a friend or two to play with.  Cheerio!"
Half life 3 confirmed!!! WOLOLO Age of empires 4 confirmed!!
"If you weren't terribly attached to this game in your childhood then I would find it hard to recommend. It has dated quite significantly (things like path finding are really annoying), but the graphics and sounds are pretty good even to this day.  But if you have played this game before and enjoyed it, or want to see one of the most influential strategy games of gaming history, look no further. AoE2 is truly a landmark of the gaming industry. The single player tells interesting stories through campaigns (all well designed), and the multiplayer offers endless replayability. Lots of different maps, civs, game-modes, teams etc. to play around with!  If you're not a strategy fan though, then stear clear.  This is an oldie, but a goldie.   Also the HD edition barely changed a thing and pretty much is a rip-off. I guess playing online via steam is the only good thing about it."
I love this game
"Wonderful game. The gameplay is very similar to the original, but this version is a little laggier it seems with player movement. I liked the graphics of the original better as well. I like the addition of the expansion packs, although I have not used them yet. I did like the original better. It stopped working on my machine though."
just like when i was a kid but looks so much cleaner and runs faster!
This game is my childhood. The theme tune alone is enough to give me goosebumps. This is the quintessential strategy game.
"I've been a huge Age of Empires fan since the time each game in the series came out. I played them to death, so I was sceptical if I should buy the HD version. I feared the HD update would not be enough.  Well, actually it was. The game runs smoothly and the widescreen native resolution is awesome. While the game is probably not worth it's full price, but I bought it on sale for a miserable 5 euros, so it was basicaly a no-brainer.  Age of Empires II is a real-time strategy game, set in real-life middle ages. You build your empire, forge powerful armies consisting of infantry, archery, cavarly, trebouchets and much more. You can choose to counquer you enemies by force, of 'force them to submit to your rule' (as I call it :P ) by building a wonder. You can also choose from multiple civilizations, throughout the world. There are numerous campaigns, such as the legendary Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Barbarossa and many more.  In short, build a mighty empire and conquer your enemies in Age of Empires II!"
"Awsome remake of the classic game. With new graphics and gameplay elements, also with an active community, this is the best RTS of all times!"
"Like all Microsoft games of its era, this seems aimed at 'the good honest family group', which while in films and television is a very real demographic, is a total myth in gaming, since almost all games are played by an individual. Kiddies can get the serfs building sweet little cottages, and mums and dads can take care of the killing. All bright white-tooth smiles. Ahem. Sniff.  Although since its original release in the Windowes 98 era this game has been eclipsed and outdated by new versions, and even better alternatives, it has faint nostalgic appeal. The HD upgrades, though very minor, are a nice touch -- could have done more, but we have to settle for what we get. First time around I chose Settlers instead, its main rival, and that really does seem the better option even now. It is a simple game, easy to pick up and intuitive, even though the nature of the graphics is somewhat messy compared to the clean lines and pure colours of today. You notice this most on the control buttons, where fiddly images have been drawn. The retro colour pallette could have been updated, because that more than anything dates this game. The narrator's accent is meant to be Scottish -- but not sure what part of Scotland that comes from, ahem. Sniff Sniff.  The achievements are valueless -- you earn five of them just for going through the tutorial. 250 more easy ones await, they'll pop up during normal gameplay. But on balance gets a thumbs up, if you buy it during an 80% off sale -- which, like MFI and its furniture sales, is most of the time."
About the same game as the Age of Empires 2 you're used to but with functional multiplayer. Pretty amazing.
"reliving childhood, just amazing."
"I'm so happy to see a game as classic as this one make it to steam.  I haven't played many of the campaigns, but multiplayer is way too easy to spend hours playing."
I can play this game for days no battle is the same and the cheats which make the game 10 times better.
"One of the greatest games ever made. New HD version seems to work great, had a few issues but they seem to be on top of fixing them. would reccomend this game forever"
is the best
Please come out on Mac :(
"Ultimately my favorite RTS game of all time.  I don't have much play time on here, as majority of my time played is when I am without internet. Steam doesn't accumulate play time while not connected to Steam, sadly. I owned the original edition of this game for PC and put well over 1,000 hours into the game. With the new remastered HD version, it's even more enjoyable.  If you enjoy RTS games, this is definitely worth the buy. Even better if you purchase it on sale, or receive it as a gift. The game just never gets old. No matter how many games you play, if you are a true fan of RTS games, you'll surely enjoy this one.  There's only one problem I have with the game, and that's occasionally not being able to see some of your units when they're stuck behind an obstacle. There's nothing that really impacts the game negatively, in my opinion. Worth every penny.  Overall, 9/10."
its the classic in sort of HD. it does the job.
Multiplayer can suck if you have a bad connection but the game is awesome.
"Although this game is almost THE carbon-copy of the original which I had been looking for, in the original there was the option to tweak the resolution so that zooming out was possible. This isn't the case here, instead, based on whatever screen resolution you have, that's it. I'm stuck with a view that is way too zoomed in to be enjoyable. Surely they can fix this."
"I expect more 'refresh' Units dont looks as good as buildings, but game is still time consuming as oryginal. Good to buy in promotion but 20 euro is too much for this game. Anyway, good relaxing strategy."
Theres 20 knights in my house as I write this review
Possibly the best strategy game ever! Not many problems except for desyncs and players dropping 
"An absolute classic, hours of fun to be had."
This was a very welcomed HD remake. Age of Empires was the first RTS game I played when I was a kid and the remake does the original proud. They kept the game the same while making it look cleaner and run smoother. If you are a fan of any of the original entries in the series this is worth picking up just for the time warp.
This is a awesome game i would love to play more on my free time
10/10 would hun flush again
It's a really fun game to play with others
"This game was epic fun when It first came out, and its still Epic fun."
"My first game was multiplayer, where my two ♥♥♥♥♥ boy friends got salty I built a wonder. Good time."
"awesome game, i used to play it since i was boy, but i was really mad in cracked version in gameranger about lag etc..., im feeling very good in steam version"
9/10
One of the pillars of Real Time Strategy. The pinnacle of the AoE series and a true chess game of 200 Hundres Pieces to each player. Use your brain and your skills in this immortal classic. Guaranteed to love for hardcore gamers.
"Do NOT purchase this game if you are trying to play lan or multiplayer games with friends. They removed lan entirely and the lag in online multiplayer is unfixable and virtually unplayable. The single player and campaign is fine but the multiplayer is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up. Not worth purchasing.  Fixed the above, games great now."
One of the best RTS that ever came out. The original died due to crappy server interface and you had to use 3rd party software servers to play making it a hassle and the default resolutions quickly became dated. With the new servers and graphic updates the game is growing bigger then ever.  Top 5 rts games on my list for sure.
This game if in one word amazing not always historically accurate but never the less is an amazing RTS and Strategy game its worth the money and could convince those that aren't too fond of this game type to think differently.
Been playing this game for over a decade. Still enjoyable and fun to kill a few hours on.
"The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.  The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.  The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.  With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.  In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]  In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, 'The Star-Spangled Banner') and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a 'second war of independence' against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an 'Era of Good Feelings' in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.  In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe."
"Actually, ı was try to open this game. But ı cant open this game on Steam Library since one week. I am trying too many way to open it but also ı cant open this game. is this a diffrent problem or other some person have this problem? How can ı find an answer for this problem? thanks."
"Oh the nostalgia is real, i cant believe this game was brought back from my childhood, love it!"
"Really fun game that test how good you can lead a army and build the best city and defense in the game. With a Steam WorkShop, map editor, and texture packs its pretty amazing."
"sick game,totally worth it. the thing i like the most is that you get a complete other way of playing it as when you were a child and only cheated usually :D now if you play it you really get to see what sick ideas and tactics are behind the game"
If you buy that game for multiplayer.. think it again.. Personally i can find only 2 servers to play.. Some times not even 1..
"A really old classic that I just adore.  P.S If anyone can help me with this.  The game seems really zoomed in than my ps2 version, is there anyway to zoom out a bit in order to see more?"
"I've no idea how this game got 68/100 as a rating, but from my End I got to say that I spend alot of time playing this with my Brother, it even got me and my brother closer somehow, we elaborate strategies and play against the bots and try to get better every single time we play. I've bought us both the new expansions that came out and we are rediscovering the whole game once more with new features. really impressed. I would recommand this game for the rest of my life, since it captures the whole essence of what an RTS should be, don't get fooled by the graphics, this game is worth every penny."
I played this as a child AND I was good at it! Then 'The Sims' came and all my strategic skills were gone with it.  Now I suck at it and can barely play through the campaign on easy mode. End of story.  It's still an awesome game though. Absolutely love it.
"Guide to winning a game of AoE2:- 1)Set the game to land map, starting in post imperial age, deathmatch. 2)Pick Goths 3)Swarm the enemy like you're the Zerg 4)Wonder why no-one plays with you :(  Yes, is gud gaem..."
Great Game!
"What can I say, a pretty fun game and with very exciting story lines on the campaign and great to play with multi players. Of course, like any other game, there will by people who ruins some experience but that is only on rare occasions. This game rely on strategy, alleys, and most important of them all, your own army and civilization. Giving this 10/10 :3"
The game you loved when you were a kid ... now in HD !!!!
"Still one if not THE best RTS ever made. All available on Steam with even more stuff than the original.  If you have played and loved this before, no doubt you'll love it again!  If you have never played AoE-II before and you like this genre, it's a must try! (Don't even compare this to AoE-III...please)"
"This is one of favourite games ever, it's disapointing that the serves aren't very good."
Rushed enemys with cavalry and won  10/10 would fap again
"First, gather a bunch of friends to play with. Then wait to see who back stabs who first."
"I don't really like RTS games, but Age of Empires II is one of the few exceptions. The thing that immediately drew me to this game was that it takes place in the past. I can wrap my head around what an archer does, but I have no idea what a  Brood Lord  or a  Warp Prism  does. The gameplay is also suprisingly simple and quick to pick up. However, there is a lot to learn and the skill ceiling is set pretty high. Good gameplay and simple mechanics keep me coming back to the game, even if I get destroyed by almost everyone I play against."
"if you play this game you will get the folowing 11,30,14"
this is gud
"i played aoe2 like 15 years ago and it was one of my favorite games like everyone else those days.Now im grown up and im better in the game and the game has bunch of new stuf(new civs,maps..) if you liked the game back then please dont hesitate just buy this game.İts great i promise :)"
"Best game of my child and adult hood! When I got grounded as a kid, I didnt get grounded from hanging out, I got grounded form AOE 2!"
Been playing this game for around 12 years from AOE. This new upgrade blew me away and put me right back since I only play the computer! I have had to go back to the beginners stage just to try and finish a game. Got the shock of my life to see ships attacking from all sides (nomad game regicide) while I am still in feudal age. The computer is cheating big time and I considered myself a good player!!! AI has superceded everything...they have armies of at least 50 assorted coming from all angles...from a pop of 125??? I have yet to see them fight each other - all just coming at me and my ally. Hello...huge computer cheats...and this is on standard - got totally wiped out in my usual moderate in early stages....too aggressive too soon??? I love the game but this has turned into a really hard game at the easiest levels almost. I used to play online but got sick of being wiped out by say 30 onagers at once coming all sides without actually strategy being used...just a bit bewildered by such a dramatic overall change to the game...
"Having recently reinstalled AOE HD including the latest patch I find it impossible to play even on easy difficulty, what used to be a very enjoyable and relaxing experience has now become a waste of time. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times over the past two days and no matter which game mode I play I am defeated every time, I am no stranger to AOE and have played on and off for many years, I will now seek to find my enjoyment elsewhere and AOE will be filed away never to be played again."
Great version of an old classic. I really wish the community was larger. I would play this so much more if there were more people online!
A classic game redone in HD with some awesome changes like max units increased and HD graphics. Great buy!
"I remember taking a Journalism class in high school just to have access to the computer lab for 2 class periods, solely to play this game. It is the cornerstone of historical strategy games since it was released. The gameplay is easy enough for anyone to pick up quickly, but deep enough for established gamers to enjoy and get involved."
"I was thrilled when Steam brought back this old and well loved classic. Workshop support and newer graphics give this game a fresh new face, and the new expansion brought new life back into this classic. I was skeptical at first, since I still have the original game disks buried somewhere, but the additional content and steam support makes this game well worth the purchase."
Just as awesome as the old version. No need for fixing that lame grapics bug because in HD its back up to date.  Some improved game mechanics. And much more troops! If you liked the old one. Get it. Play it. Love it!
Feels just like the original. Textures are updated slightly but not much has changed. There are some textures in the workshop that help a little.
"The English are terrorising all of Scotland, and it's time for you to fight back... again!"
"Well worth the purchase, have spent many good fun hours with my mates at LANS. Brings back the good old days of playing on windows 95 computers."
"This game doesn't needs to any description and any discussion, because everyone knows the drill... this game is legendary and most dominant of strategy games!"
if you dont have this game get it it is one of the best games of all time.
Ever since this came out it was on my 'standard games to play' list.  It never came off that list and now through steam makes it easier to play with friends and add mods through the workshop!  5/7 or 10/10!
Great game
If you haven't brought this game yet then......   Wolololoooooo!!   See now you're all better
Great game!
Best RTS. Played it since i was 14
loads of fun to get into
"Just like childhood, amazing, not old but classic and a must have in any playlist! :D"
One of legendary games. Worth to play
"I have loved AOE II for such a long time. Seeing it on sale for so cheap, I bought it up right away. Even if you are not a big RTS fan, give this one a shot. It is a masterpiece! :)"
"The mechanics and gameplay of the AOE series were seminal in the development of the modern RTS. Age of Empires II is arguably the best iteration. When I saw that this game was up for re-release, I had to snap it up for multiplayer alone. Still fun after nearly two decades... They just don't make 'em like they used to!"
Ye its good stuff
Awesome.... One of my fav Strategy game ever
This game will  never  get old. I appreciate that they implemented a relative stable multiplayer. +ELO-rating +Soundtrack  brings GOOD OLD TIMES back!! 
This is a masterpiece of a strategy game that has been revied in glorious HD and with Steam Workshop functionality... An absolute must for anyone who crave a simple addictive medieval style RTS without all the hardcore politics b.s.  Pro's   - Extremely fun &amp; addictive gameplay - Easy to learn and play - Multiplayer is simple to use and get working  - Mod support  - Contains various story modes and custom games (which can be edited thoroughly) - For a 17 year old game it still holds up remarkably well.   Cons   - Multiplayer saves desync upon re-loading.
"Played it when I was a kid, when I tried playing it on my pc it was unable to play due to the game operating only under old opertaing systems. The second I saw it on steam I bought it, and it is still one of the best games I have ever played. Definitly something I recommend playing if you are into RTS games. It is also fun to play in sandbox and have thousands of troops fighting.  10/10 best game NA, and its cheap!"
"This game offers a lot in a simple strategy game. It is dynamic, non-repetitive and fun. In my not owning steam days, even before my console days, I played alot of age of empires 2 then 3. The most fun thing to do is go easy AI on a standard singleplayer and decimate all other societies in your way but there is a multiplayer for people who enjoy that. The game never lags on most good PC's and you can easily get hours upon hours out of it, and I hate RTS/strategy games like XCOM but this one in particular stands out. Would also recommended Age of Empires III.  Note: You can also get trading cards and achievements very easily from this just by winning one game you unlock 1/4 of the achievements. It's not flawless, but is a affordable masterpiece that is worth your time and money,"
This is not HD or any new data. This looks and plays like it did years ago. Not worth more than $2. Waste of my $10.
"I have been playing this game since 10... I am really happy with the new expansion packs as the campaigns allow you to complete the game differently with different ending, which is a big improvement compared to the old campaigns. But yeah, when I tried to play a single-player game with the new AI, it is insanely difficult..."
"I love this game. When it came out on Steam in HD, I literally said 'Shut up and take my money' and you should too."
"One the best RTS games of all time gets an HD overhaul. A better game engine that provides higher resolutions, more units on screen without lag, higher population limits, Steam multiplayer support, and more.  A must own for any fans of the classic Age of Empires series."
"Good old game , i have so much fun playing it with my friends . The only problem with this game is the delay when playing a multiplayer match , hope this will get fixed."
very interesting game especially when you ply with friends...stimulates the mind in ways never seen before especially when youre feeling different!
"Amazing game, great for friends to play together."
Gewd game.   Att: dondiman
It's as good as you remebmer but in HD !
"well i dont know how they call this HD? its the same old game looks no different,  not worth buying. also having issues with sound crackling its an old game and should be left in the past"
"I have played AoE2K and AoE2C in the past before Steam or HD, spent hundreds of hours in the past playing multiplayer, specifically custom maps all lthrough the defunct MSN network. Back then it was something of a golden age of these RTS games and custom map games, Tower defense, 21 steps races and so on.. i played very few deathmatch games with others in the past.  With HD though, i can come back to the game i used to play a great deal once again, with the steam service allowing multiplayer to once again flourish. I recently bought the game through a sale with expansions, i have done one Deathmatch against the AI that lasted 10 hours of play and a few hours on the campaigns. the only really notable things stand out, the fire effects on buildings, the smoothness in the animations and finally how much stuttering a 8 player random match with 7 AI's takes out of a powerful computer system.  However it all seems good so far, but being the original game has probably just been optimized and touched up in the code and such, it is the same game i have always played in the past.  Edit: The AI is far more stronger then i remember playing all those years ago, it can be adaptive and i have seen this a few times, typically destroying the TC and villagers is enough to force the AI to surrender regardless of standing army or what military buildings it has. as it is on 'Standard' difficulty, i am having trouble trying to complete 'Jihad!' on the Saladin missions, enemies coming at you from all directions, one enemy starts building a wonder almost straight off the bat. by the time you get to the imp age and start building what you need, the wonder is already up with about 250-300 years to spare. plus all the forces inside the gates. it is not impossible, however considering it takes around on average 3 hours to complete a mission on aoe2. Tactical thinking missions is what i enjoy mostly about AOE2, so credit where it is due. whoever created this new AI did some solid work for AOE2. hope i can get through the campaigns, could take weeks if not months to do."
"Like old times with better resolution, buggs fixed and new civs"
I had this game before I just purchased it now and I can tell you it is by far one of the best games I ever played. it's never ending game play is why I played it for 6-7 years straight before I got a mac. Because this game can run on any pc piece of junk I will soon be back on this amazing game. definately worth every penny
Villagers hunt with bows but walk straight up to enemies. 11/10
"Childhood favorite game, is a must buy for those who like Real Time Strategy games. All time classic.  EDIT: files cannot be recovered when trying to restart a multiplayer game, games completely lost. No ETA on fix. Don't buy/play unless you can finish a game in one sitting."
Love This game !!! The Nostalgia xD
Any one and everyone had at least one friend that played this game back in the day there is no reason that anyone shouodn't own this game today ☺
The king of RTS back!! No more comments. 
"Man I've been playing this game series since I was 5! A pure nostalgic game indeed. After I found out there was an HD edition, I knew I had to buy it someday, this is where all strategy games was born, one of the fathers of great real-time strategy games. Build an empire, conquer and dominate the battlefield! Epic battles, great campaign, lots of maps, with 18 unique civilizations to choose from, you gotta love it! :)"
The memories of rushing my brothers best friend with Elephants... Ah those were the days...  His parting words - 'Holy S***!'  Those were really good days...
"I'm glad that I had found this game on steam. I had this game as a kid but with only the Conquers expansion, but now I also have the Forgotten expansion."
I love this game i remember playoing this game when i was in grade school. idk if its the nostalgia talking but i would recommend anyone this game you loves rts games
"Age of Empires II HD is a very nice game.It's the hardest strategy game I ever played! The HD edition is awsome, it's an huge graphical upgrade. I recommend it, because it's an old historical game and I played it a lot in my childhood. Buy it if you love strategy games, you want to learn some history or to have some fun with friends!"
"Let's get this out of the way immediately; I wouldn't buy this game at full price. But then, it's regularly on sale, and it has come a long way in the last two years.  Now, I grew up playing the original Age of Empires: Rise of Rome, and Age of Empires II: The Conquerors games, so I knew exactly what to expect with AoE II: HD. The graphics are only slightly updated, but honestly that was barely an issue for me. The massively improved AI (one that doesn't just resign at random) is a major factor; they actually pose a threat now. Another big factor is the increased map size and population count combination; the original game always felt like you needed a lot more units, even with a 200 pop limit. The Forgotten Empires expansion adds quite a nice selection of new civilisations, some of which offer slightly different strategies. Also, AoE II has graphical issues on modern GPUs, so this is the best way of playing the classic game.  Now, for the negatives. For the greatest time, this game performed abysmally on the biggest map size and with high populations, which is absurd. They've largely fixed this... but it's still not great, and still relies way too much on a single core. And I have issues with ridiculously high pings when playing online with a friend (who lives in a foreign country, but we have no ping issues in games like Left 4 Dead 2), which have never really improved. The AI, on water maps, has a tendency to build so many boats that the game becomes nigh-on unwinnable (unless you can build a mass of castles near by and not get wiped out in the process). It has also proven to be tempermental when run in windowed mode, and units occasionally bug out and get totally stuck, meaning you have to kill them.  In conclusion; if you liked AoE II, you'll love this. Get it on sale, as it's a very fair price when 75%/80% off. But wait for a sale. If you didn't like AoE II for any reason other than you felt it was too easy... this probably won't change things for you."
"I haven't stopped playing AoEII since the early '00s, and the new updates and playing community are awesome. I definitely recommend anyone who enjoys RTS style gameplay check this one out."
come on! keeps disconnecting ........ I never had any problems 10 years ago... now ?? come on developers.. get your ♥♥♥♥ straight.. if the game detects some problems don't disconnect it!!!
"I myself am a massive fan of the 'medieval era', and any sort of game revolving around it, whether that be an RPG, a strategy, or something completely different, I also strongly enjoy strategy games. Obviously, you don't want to be hearing my likes and dislikes, just the game review...  Where do I begin with this game; This game is overall an exceptional game! Although it being an old game just with slightly improved graphics, it is great, and the minor things that were at fault in the original are fixed in this version. I played the original for many hours and thus far haven't had the time to sink into this version, nevertheless I still fully appreciate what this game has to offer.  It's a pretty generic strategy game, but don't use that as a reason to not check this game out, the campaign is brilliant! There are multiple campaigns following the stories of different characters stretching back a couple thousand years, so there is a lot of variety, some of these characters being: Joan Of Arc, Genghis Khan or even William Wallace! And for each of the campaigns you use a selection of factions/countries such as: Britons, Celts, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolion, Goths and many, many more, all of which have unique special units and different tech trees for the extra advantage, but none of which are over-powered, they are all perfectly balanced, applying different buffs and debuffs.  In the few hours that I've played the 'HD Edition' I mostly played the Multiplayer, which allows you to play with any of the afformentioned factions with of course more, you can play large games with lots of people, being friends on Steam or random players across the world, or even AI! There is a large plethora of maps, ranging in sizes depending on how many players you have, you can even play maps based on real countries and that countries landscape!  As you have probably been wondering, if you are not sure, in this game (discluding the campaign and certain maps/game modes), you start with a small Town Centre in the Dark Age, along with some villagers, you can send these villagers off to build houses, barracks', mills, farms, or send them to chop wood, mine gold/stone, forage for berries, find sheep/turkeys to harvest for meat, then you can upgrade through the ages, each new age will require varying amounts of gold/food and once you have progressed you will be supplied with brand new upgrades, those of which you'll have to find out for yourself. You can then build an army with Archers, Swordsman, Cavalry, all of which have different types and upgrades, then you can destroy your enemys! There are however, other ways to win, but these you'll also have to find for yourself!  Overall, you can tell that I am a fan of this game, so I'd strongly recommend you buy it, and as of this review it is on the Christmas deal being only £2.99 (GDP), which is a bargain! This game is brilliant, great campaign, fun multiplayer, awesome AI, amazing skirmishes!"
I love Age of Empires I and II but I have requested a refund for the first time and wrote my first review simply to say that Age of Empires II HD is virtually unplayable. I played AoE since I was a kid on computers that were before Windows 95 OS that played these games perfectly. My card runs Skyrim on Ultra and I lag so bad in AoE single player that doing something as simple as building a structre or attacking has become almost impossible. The game is simply broken.
Anyone that doesn't like AoE must have been 'wololol'ed by an enemy monk.
"Great game, old memmories :`))"
"WARNING: Multiplayer saves are currently completely broken, and multiplayer is overall extremely buggy."
"Played this as a kid, still a great game over a decade later. Only issue is the occasional lag in multiplayer when someone's computer/internet can't keep up."
The most awesome game ever ! &lt;3
"The nostalgia really comes creepin' in on me when I play this game. And the best part is that it's one of the few old games I can still enjoy as a good game, rather than  just  a nostalgia-game.  If you're fond of strategy games, this is really a game for you."
"been playing this game for 15 years, i still love it though. there has been a lot of games made in the shape of this game. 10/10. would get slaughtered by the turks 1 more time"
-Allows you to make old AI and updated AI fight against each other on the same map. -Updated threading and multiprocessor usage that allows for massive calculations for more exciting experience. -The fires animations looks more real -The water looks more real.  
"Awesome game, however has some multiplayer lags that must be fixed."
"This game: is a phenomenal, classic, RTS; made by a phenomenal company, Ensemble Studios; focuses more of development of societies and nations, rather than just military battles; and is an incredibly fun game to play with your friends, and just chill out with. This game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, its incredibly fitting and catchy, and it isn't repetitive or unvarying. This game's multiplayer functions great, and is a ton of fun to play with a big group of friends. The graphics, while clearly not aging well, aren't hindering to the experience, as the musical score and gameplay take up most of your attention when playing. Overall, I absolutely love this game, and nearly everything about it. This is the definitive Age of Empires experience, and the quintessence of Real-time Strategy games. I strongly reccomend this title to anyone who loves RTS games, or anyone who is looking for a nostalgic trip down early-2000s memory lane."
"I like this remake in 'HD'. I can only see the difference in the water. Anyway, AI has been enhanced, the graphics are cool, I love the music  Wololo~"
"Very nice game, if u got a lot of free times play it!  Games can be long as fk *beeep*  "
"Brilliant game always has been, playing a FFA game with 8 mates on the stupidly huge map is the best fun you can have in this game!"
"best with multiplayer, one of my favortites to play"
Very nice game
Love this game and the updates the have completed. Reminds me of the good times when I was a kid!
"That is my childhood,  I'm not writing about this, there's no chance you know nothing about this game.  I literally spent a whole year playing this game.  10/10"
"This game will bring back memories, by latest hardware/resolution in HD. Great one."
Ah sweet sweet nostalgia. How I missed playing this game with friends.
"Yep, it's not so new, and not so shiny, and you should just say no to drugs. But you're still gonna buy it, next time it's on sale."
"No. Why? Actually i have original version from 2000 on my cd, but odd in my pc isnt working, and i decided to buy it. I dont know why, but this version sucks. im going to change it then install old version"
Paladins FTW. Never forget the villagers lost to the Eagle Scout hordes...
"Great game, a lot of fun!"
"This game never gets old, and with the new AK expansion, it won't for a while."
The classic has been revamped!
Perfect it's like the original BUT BETTER Original AI still never know where to go.. And new AI run into your town just to destroy an outpost and leave xD Otherwise it's all great  10/10 would train 200 paladins again 
been playing this game for 6 years and i still suck online
"Age of Empires 2....where should I start...already played the game when I was a child, discovering how army of monks preaching can sink an armada of warships, swordsman makes fire into buildings by slashing them, cannonballs move in slow motion and dodgeable by a lucky monk, transport ships can fit 20 elephants but not 20  vegetarian  monks.  45/10 will preach at ships again"
True to the original - plays well!
"This game is the best. Most of my time on it is from LAN matches on the regular AOE II, but this port is still excellent. There seems to be some lag issues and connectivity issues, and it doesn't seem to be HD necessarily, but it is still a great game."
This is an all time classic strategy game that comes from the era that placed the biggest focus on gameplay. The fact that it still has a strong following 16 years on speaks volumes.   Pros: Great gameplay mechanics Excellent PvP gamplay Easy to learn but difficult to master  Cons: Dated graphics (but seriously who cares?!)
  I totally review this game for the badges.   Plz ignore me &lt;3
Great game!
"Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is alive and kicking? I mean a proper alive, not the 'oh we just updated the graphics for nostalgia's sake' so that some game artists can make a decent living. My previous review was written around the time the HD edition was released and I was banking on only nostalgia to validate my purchase -- but now there's been a new expansion and the competitive scene seems to have massively grown to the point where this is a viable RTS, online games and all. Video tutorials going in depth for each civilization, new strategies and tactics being developed today (this review being written on the 30th of December, 2015), and not quite 24/7 Twitch streams but still enough content during prime times to gain a following. Who'd have thought?  I've included my older review below, but it was mostly a self-indulgent tale of how I came to start playing this game and my appreciation for its revitalization -- but I never imagined that it would get to this point.  -----  I'll be honest, nostalgia was the biggest factor in my purchase of this game.  Age of Empires happens to hold a rather special place in my personal gaming history as it's one of the first purchases I immediately regretted. This was because I had accidentally purchased the expansion pack instead of the main game, thus was unable to play.   Now, there used to be a time where internet speeds were nowhere near fast enough to download nor even update games in a timely fashion (this was before youtube could even dream of being a thing). Game developers had to save any extra content they wanted to add onto a game and release it in a seperate box. Usually, these packs would contain a lot of content in order to create more value that could offset the cost of a physical release. The Sims franchise is about the only series that continues this tradition.  So, some innumerable years ago (only because I refuse to count) I was embarrassed because I had spent my allowance on the wrong game. This isn't really the focal point of my nostalgia, but to fully understand it I need to probe the depths of what memories I can find before I had a computer.  Backtracking further into the past, there was a point where I observed someone playing the original Age of Empires -- I think it was at a friend of the family's house. This happened at an age before I could be reasonably trusted to handle a computer, but like the supposed effect of playing Mozart and other classical musicians to a baby the image of this game burned itself into my subconscious somewhere. That or I simply couldn't stop talking about it. Maybe I substituted the normal games of pretend and imagination with my toys for more structured games and called it 'Age of Empires,' but trying to remember any of this is a rather futile effort. I'm not sure why or how but this game simply stuck with me.  I remember passing by a display of computer games some years later and immediately recognizing the title. There was a rush of excitement as I took hold of the box and confirmed what my memories were telling me. Yes, this was the sequel to that game you remember from so long ago. Yes, you do have the system requirements to play the game. Yes, this could happen today.  Turns out I was blinded by excitement, as previously mentioned. Eventually I did grab a compilation pack that included AoE II, AoE II: The Conquerors expansion, a gold edition of the original AoE, and a sound track. Holy ♥♥♥♥ did I play those games.   Playing now, I realized how terrible I used to be at the game. I'm not sure how I got through the campaign, except by sheer determination and just playing it over and over again. That and cheatcc. It's an old-school no-holds-barred RTS. The proper game was far too difficult for my past self, but at that age I could enjoy myself for days with the little laser riflement and the RPG-weilding cars as I simply cheated my way through the campaign and single-player content. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on the 12 year olds shooting untold numbers of faceless soldiers in games like Call of Duty, I was commiting time-travel genocide at that age. Over and over and over again.  But now that the story's done, there's an interesting competitive scene (still?) revolving around the game that surprised me. Found a ton of videos on youtube of people playing rather masterfully and it encouraged me to revise tactics and actually start beating some of those levels I found impossible (even on Easy). That being said, I'm still getting wrecked by the computer every now and then. The more things change, the more they stay the same.  It's a good game, but it's old. Little pathfinding errors are probably going to annoy you. This is for the fans of the old game who have lost their disc(s). Or those who still have their discs and just need an excuse to play again...  http://i.imgur.com/yCd8Epi.jpg "
Wololo Spam.  10/10
childhood
What else can be said about the game that walk with us during our childhood? Stop reading this rewiews and buy the game.
"An amazing historical educational tool! Teaches people about the importance of: -Stabbing your house will cause a fire. -Waving a wand at people will cause them to be under your command -The Chinese invented gunpowder, block printing, and crop rotation, but aren't able to get them. -Being able to produce hundreds of paladins despite only in real life being 12 paladins. -Villagers like using knives in combat despite being able to wield flaming arrows. -A battering ram hitting the air will cause your crops to wilt. -The fact that your civilization knows about fletching, bodkin arrows, and bracers affect how far a cannonball travels, despite those technologies purposes are to make arrows travel further. -People in Medieval times apparently had bullet spewing cars -A fat king travels faster than a horseman    Want a serious review? Fine.  Age of Empires II HD is an excellent bargain during Steam Sales, with all DLC bought during the sale along with the base game costing less than the base game pre Steam Sale. The game is just as I remembered it to be years ago, but with prettier water and better AI, it will burn away hours of your life away... Don't have a good internet connection to play multiplayer? Don't want to get pwned during multiplayer matches but want a little more spice in your single player game? Then campaign is for you, with many different stories to follow. Overall, 11/10, would get wololo'd again."
very good game black knee grows
"Gather Children, for i have a tale of land which you can rule and forever sail."
Love this game. Been playing it for years.
Played this game in early childhood. Saw the game for sale. Having fun. Memories.
"Age Of Empires, A Very Classic Simple Empire Game. This Game allows you to either flourish your economy and punch your enemies where you want to... their wallet Or If you favor brutal wars such as myself enjoy starting a game on easy and marching 500 troops to their front door just to assert your dominance Literally Cant stop playing, The technology could be indepth but the multiplayer which is still very alive covers that easily 9/10"
This is an amazing game i higly recommend it for strategy gamers realy its one of the best games i played in my life since i was 6 have fun i know i did
I've loved this game since I was about 5 years old. I love how they didn't change the game. Everything is perfect in this game and online is fun. Nothing will change the way I feel about this game.
"Just like old time, all the great memories this game game bring"
Love it. Nice upgrade of a game that i had a lot of fun playing. Will have to give the multi-monitor a try.
One of the best RTS games out there. You should defintely consider getting it.
"I was so thrilled to see AOE2 on Steam! It is great to see this title being given an extended life for old and new players. I played this countless hours in the past, and it is nice to have available to play here! Great visuals, familiar controls and game play. If you played back in the day you will have the same great memories delivered to you intact. Well worth the purchase! The workshop bonus is icing on the cake!!!"
A great remake of a classic game. Let's have more remakes like this!
"Classic Age of Empires II HD has all the elements of the orginial game plus more. Worth the buy especially during this winter sale. Great time killer, fun campaign, and good 'replayability'"
"It's so easy to get lost in this game. The time i've spent was a lot of fun, then i realized it was 3 in the morning. I'm typically not one for RTS games, but there's just so much replay value, and then you have all the DLCs for it. Final Verdict: 9.5/10"
The game that made me like games!
why the game wont running in my pc? pls someone help me
This game needs no real introduction. It's a classic 4X game that's on Steam now. Buy it.
Really fun. Great for playing with friends and just campaigning alone
"The only reason to play Age of Empires II is because its the second greatest strategy game of all time. I would say its the greatest strategy game of all time, but I'm prevented by the sheer fact that 'wololo' is the greatest unit sound ever.  So far I've had only a few bugs and the terrible graphical 'improvements' like the new farm textures can be fixed easily thanks to steam workshop."
One of the greatest RTS games EVER!
"This game is not just a nostalgia trip down memory lane. The graphics have been masterfully re-created to work on 1080p displays and flawlessly under new 64-bit windows OS's. The gameplay is smooth and the excitement and tension is all still there, just more alive and vivid than ever. This is on my list of 'Must Have' games and will be at home in any RTS fan's library of treasures."
best ever to get into the new year.
This game is a classic. Everyone of us has played AoE sometimes and we all know what this game is. You can spend hours just building your own empire and see it rise from nothing. AI is good enough at least with forgotten dlc and updates it brought. Even without it AI is good enough but sometimes it crashes and enemies don't do nothing. But mostly this game works almost percectly and is quite nice looking with HD. I'll give it 9/10
The integration with steam is the best thing about this.
One of the best RTS games you will play. Has a similar style of play to Starcraft or Warcraft with a medeival twist. Worth a play. Has a dedicated online community. See you in a deathmatch. Woolooloo!
"Vary good, death to the infidels."
"I confess: I might have never stopped playing this game ever since I was about 12. That is 10+ years in the world of AoE. Sure multiplayer with random people online is better done at voobly, but I prefer to play with friends, and really like new content in a more than 17 years old game. That is simply amazing,"
"AoE Logic;  Fat King outruns cavalry. Boats can be flat mates with other units. 5 War Elephants fit on a transport, 6 villagers does not. Villagers chopping through forests and let the enemy in. Your own trade units opens your gates and let the enemy in. Spanish Supremacy. Wololol. Friendly onagers killing your entire army. Can convert buildings or catapults to your own religion. Historical Accuracy is as good as an archer without balistics (in some cases at least) DauT being DauT.  Only in Age of Empires! (why haven't you bought it yet??)   "
"WELL, I SPENT TEN MINUTES FORMATTING A REVIEW BUT MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MODEM RESET ITSELF AND I LOST IT (literally and emotionally). SO HERE IS MY NEW, REVISED REVIEW:    it's alright"
"haha,my childhood game.time to wololo"
just like i remember from when i was a kid
"Long long years ago my Brother taught how ı can play this game and I started to play AOE that time. Then, I saw it in Steam and decided to buy. I downloaded, I played, everything was like long long years ago. By the way, Greetings from me to my Brother with love :D"
"I would recommend it without lags, out of sync messages and without waiting for the game to continue."
"Still as good as ever, but this time in HD. Just as terrifyingly easy to lose hours to a single game without really noticing, too.   "
"Age of Empires 2 is one of the best Real Time Strategy games. It gives you the freedom to build your structures anywhere, which some RTS games limit you to certain areas. I've spent many, many, many hours playing this game. It's great!!!"
The best game ever!
Classic. WIth the added bonus of 500 units! :)
Amazing game. This was the first real game I played in PC and I love being able to play it again without all of the compatability issues.
"Exactly the way I remember right down to the dodgy AI pathfinding when they go next to each other.  But it's still as great, now in HD!"
"If you are a fan of the old RTS style, this game is a MUST BUY. It's the same game from 1999 with improved graphics and Steam Workshop. Great gameplay, and it's really fun playing it with friends vs another people or AI. The expansion (Forgotten Empires) is awesome too, 5 new civilizations and new units improves the game. If you played this and miss the old times it's a must have, if you never played it BUY IT AND PLAY IT. RIGHT NOW !!!"
Still one of the best stretegy games on the market nearly 15 years after its initial release. Although cannon units seem to trump most other units the rest of the game is fairly balanced. The Forotten adds plenty of new stuff to freshen the game up as well and will add countless hours to your AOE experience.
"Exactly what I remember from the old days, but can be a hassle to properly setup port forwarding for multiplayer"
"Age of Empires II is if not the most well rounded RTS game I know, the fact that lot's of people still play it makes this game even be possible to be played with multiplayer. This along with the forgotten adds up pleasing civilizations. Most importantly it isn't called HD for a reason though the original game was pretty aswell, it is good to know that with this version there won't be colour issues such as purple waters and red grass.  I'd always recommend a classic they aren't called classics without due reason naturally."
high def wolololololo
"This game is a throwback to when I was a kid. Additionally, I enjoy the expansion packs which include more maps, civs, and campaigns. The game is fun to play online against friends, as well as offline."
A must have for any strategist. Casual or hardcore
"The old version looked better.   Menus are blurry in this one. The water is 'beautifully' rendered 3D, everything else is old-school.   Cant change the resolution?! wtf... it's just weird.  Good job ruining AOE, Microsoft."
You can convert a cataputl to christianity 10/10
its good
"Although I was a little skeptical coming over from Age of Empires - Rise of Rome... I found this game easy to adapt to even though I didn't really like it at first.  I'm still just scratching the surface of this game but so far, but it really does hold up to the original.  I'd recomend buying if you enjoy any of the AoE games."
Wow this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!xD xD Buy it you ♥♥♥♥♥♥
"As much as I would love to recommend anything AOE2 related, I can't recommend this port.  Online play is terrible, with 3-4 second delay (despite everyone's internet being good) and very glitchy. It seems to get worse with each update.  The new expansions don't make up for it because with each new one, the online play seems to get more and more unstable.  While it is true that this game does have a lot going on, so it would make sense for it to be buggy online, the original game was not nearly as bad with this. They've had over 2 years to fix this, yet they seem to be doing the opposite.  Just stick with the original. Play it on gameranger or voobly."
"i love this game, but every time i play it it lags more an more. my friend cant play now because he had to move and his new place has ♥♥♥♥ internet. but i run FIOS and when i play single player on any map size it lags to hell and jumps all over the place. i learned to play small maps because the best map (the largest) cant be played because it lags to hell and back. now i cant even play large. such bull. if they fix that, this game would be 10x's more awesome than it already is."
"Important things I've learned from Age of Empires:  If you want to win a war the most important people to kill are civilians. To put out a fire you send your civilians to repair it with a hammer. Civilians live for the sole purpose of the war effort. To save on resources make sure all your civilians and soldiers wear the same clothes as their equals and eat the exact same amount of food. No more, no less.  Units that blow themselves up are an excellent strategy for taking out castles. Trees make an impenetrable wall if you don't cut them down. A villager in some obscure corner of the map can be your salvation or your doom. Archers are also alchemists and change their gold into food. Only villagers get to collect food from hunted beasts. Villagers burn lots of calories and eat a little less than a knight and his horse combined (a mere 20% less).  10/10 Would learn again."
nice rework of the old version but the price is a little bit to high only for better graphics
Great for reliving childhood glories... IT IS GOOD TO BE THE KING OF THE LOSERS
"This game is a legend among RTS gamers. Many AoE fans prefer this game over AoE III. AoE II is suppose to have the theme of the Dark/Medieval Ages to the Age of Imperialism/Colonialsim. The civs in the base game include the Celts, Britons (British), Franks (French), and even the Huns. Like Civ different civilizations have different special units. Unlike civ, they have unique technologies and also a degree of historical accuracy (i.e. Aztecs not having calvary units) or access to certain techs or building that goes into the accuracy. With it being an RTS that means no waiting around for the other players in multiplayer. Both RTS and Turn Based strategy games have their advantages and disadvantages so I'd consider it not fair to compare AoE and Civ and determine which are better. With that said the only gripe I have is in AoE II it's harder to get supplies and AoE III improved upon issues as well as brought in new ages and civs as well as many new features. Both are great but AoE III is $40 and it's 10 years old (originally released in 2005). So get AoE III when it's on sale and as for AoE II HD, if you prefer more of a challenge collecting rescources and the Medieval theme then this is up your alley."
One of my all time favorite pc games of all time. 10/10 would wololo again.
great game
"One of the best strategy games I have played. Whether it be building up your empire, destroying others' bases or struggling to protect your own, you will always have a blast in AoE II HD. Every game is different to the previous, and the online community is excellent. The latest expansion 'The African Kingdoms' is also a serious credit to this game, introducing even more content to keep things going. Coming from someone who has played the original Age of Empires II and still does using the Voobly matchmaking program, this game is for all who like to use their brain and strategise - whether it be on your own or as a team. Gather some friends together, start up a match and have a blast in moments that you will never forget."
Converted ship to christianity 10/10
this game will take control of your life. but i mean that in the best way imagineable.i only got through a small part of a play through for this game and the diversity of the little people is great. each one does exactly what you tell it to do until it no longer can (basically until the map is clear of resources). great game just...yesssss 
Because its the best RTS for ♥♥♥♥'s sake!
one of the best RTS's of all time. Period.
"i'm rather new to the steam community but this game is quite fun and interntaining. the game has severe different modes and ways to play it but i believe the best and most atractive part is its multiplayer, you can play with your friends,against , or split into teams."
"Edit:  Second day playing and constanty getting an out of sync error with a friend.  Both of us are reinstalling the game now. If it persists I will have to change my positive raiting. :(  As you can see my hours aren't up yet, but i've played this game since I was a kid.   I still have the game but lost the CD key and am glad it's gone on sale. Now I will never lose it. :D   Totally worth playing.   If it does't support online play I will be changing this review a little bit though. ;)"
"One of the best strategy games even now ! i enjoy it a lot, it is worth every penny !  "
"The game of my childhood remastered in HD with multiple new features such as: Population increase, Steam workshop, and easier multiplayer exerpience all around. Definantly a good purchase if you are a fan of RTS games. I give it a 5 out of 5."
This is the game we all know and loved 12 years ago with just improved graphics and a fully functional multiplayer. By far one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.
30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30
"This game is a timeless classic, easy to learn and an amazing time with friends!"
Age of Empires 2 was my first computer game and is still one of my all-time favorites.
"Age of Empires II is one of those classics that never get old. It is a great game and one of the first RTS I have ever played excluding aoe1 of course. I would recomend this game to ANYONE who enjoys a timless classic or a great RTS. One of if not my favourite games in my library of 250+ games lol. The mod support, texture packs and other add-ons are amazing. What are you waiting for? GET IT!"
Wonderful Game if you enjoy rts games. Very fun to play with friends as well.
Great game to play with friends.
The best Strategy game ever. Read Critic reviews for understanding the low rate/score.  Old but gold.
my favorite from childhod
"In my opinion, the only game that could challenge this one for the title of 'Best RTS of all Time' would be the original Starcraft. It's an absolutely riveting, addicting game that, despite now pushing 20 years old is still as fun now as it was when it first came out. If you can get past the fact that the graphics look primitive by today's standards, you will have fun for countless hundreds of hours. This is one gem that you cannot pass up under any circumstances. Buy this game yesterday! 10/10."
"What a joke, unplayable"
its good 
Still the best.
"16 years later, this landmark in RTS history has recieved a new expansion pack, including interesting new nations and full-voiced, varied campaigns. Add to that the remastered graphics and the inclusion of the previous two expansion packs and you got tens of hours of straightforward but highly addictive RTS action ahead of you. Whether you are an old-time fan back for one of the most influential RTS in videogame history or a newcomer to the genre, it was never a better time to play Age of Empires II."
Great game from the past. Still enjoy spending hours on it but really wish they would have optimized this game for the current era. Framerate takes a huge dump when you play with 500 pop and get about 1000 units moving in the game. The Ludikris map size make the FPS drop too. No matter what kind of PC you use the FPS will always be too low with this game. I love it but i seem to be a little bias due to all my free time going to this game as a kid.
"  Childhood favorite game of mine. Highly recommend this game, every match is quick-paced, exciting, and entertaining. Play as your favorite Civilizations too, and don't forget the expansions, they are worth the cost.  And for those just learning how to play online, try unranked matches to get experience. Welcome to the AoE2 community!  9.5/10, would recommend"
  if you do not own this game then you are definately not a true RTS gamer for this is the best RTS game that i know of.
new twist on a great classic game. Plus size. wit a PHat
Best RTS ever! I totally recommend for the true fans and veteran players. Amazing to have an expansion after 20 years.
Just finished playing a 4v4 with my friends  I guess we could say it was fun.
"I enjoyed this game on a number of levels. You have the fog of war to clear and scout units with which to do so. I like the bit of mystery at the beginning and the feeling of accomplishment I get when I've cleared the map. There's also different types of water navigation units that serve the purposes of gathering resources, transporting ground units, and fighting battles. And you can expand your territories by starting new towns in other areas.  I like games that encourage player creativity, allowing for a unique experience every time. That, more than anything else, will bring me back to Age of Empires over and over again."
Awesome. a must have!
Old but gold!
What a throwback! The graphics and AI have been updated to deliver a game that's just as challenging and fun as it used to be.
AoE II has aged wonderfully and is even better than I remember it.
"Great game! Brings up so many memories, and it's great to play in such a cool version with extra features and everything else!"
"I got to conquer the Mongols, whilst playing as the Hungarians.  In Japan."
"Combines both Age of Kings and Conquerors and Brings two Additional expansions into it with about 6 campaign stories with their own legs.  Only two Cons I found in the HD collection was the fact that when buildings were on low HP and were on fire before , the pixelated low res fire seemed like fire whereas the new fire effects that has been pasted over the same old buildings looks awkward. The 2nd is the fact that there is no AOE 1 and Rise of Rome.  10/10 same old AOE + more customizations."
Had the original back in the day. Loved it.  Bought this. Still love it. The extras beyond the original release[s] are great.
"Best strategy game ever created, worst netcode possible and throw in the mix of people that spike from 100ms to 6000ms and you have yourself one of the most infuriating game experiances ever made possible.  It's literally the same every game: Angel_Of_KinGz_xx: pop 500 plz! And you're like yea why not lets try it out. Only to find out that 60% of the players in the game are still using ISDN and windows 95 because when the game goes over like 200 pop it just breaks down. You try to kindly inform them that perchance they are downloading something? The only response you EVER_EVER_EVER_EVER_EVER_EVER_GET is something in their own stupid language, its either that or its one of those guys that doesn't know how to read. You know the guy im talking about, you literally call him out by his maiden birthname and you ask him NICELY to respond. He doesn't know how to press enter and type: StFU n0000ooOooOooB!!!!!  Atleast that would be a response to know that he is indeed alive and didn't die (most players are from sketchy countries that might get bombed by isis any second tbh).  10/10 gameplay 2/10 multiplayer  overall 12/10 score not bad!"
It's funny
"if you love history, buy it!"
"Its older than most the people on steam yet it is still one of the geratest RTS's about  The HD rework is beautiful it plays brilliantly with no bugs or crashes and it has had some good new features added (IE pop cap can b set upto 500) and the new AIs are really, really good  This game passed the test of time because its mechanics are simple yet deep, its RTS back in its purest form and its glorious.  Get it. now"
greatest tactical game
Epic... Simply the best!
"Age of Empires II HD  If you wish all your childhood dreams revisitied - look no further!  Age of Empires II HD is the same game we all love and remember, just filled with more content, campaigns, improved UI, easier to play with your friends via multiplayer and it looks a tad better visualy.   Simply nostalgic, timeless and epic strategy game that in some regards even out-shadow other games in the same genre made over a decade later. Need i say more?"
"lovely. mmmmmm so good, I just love getting wrecked by my friends, but yo it's all good, I just got no game. But this game is bomb, Buy it yo, buy it with friends, makes it better."
"Great, love the civs, shame about the graphics, because all buildings instantly fall down :P But other than that, its my all time favourite game, been playing it for 8 years (I'm 14) and I've spent more than 2k hours on it, even before steam purchased it. Well done developers."
"Played a game with a friend, he made an army of monks, I made a wall that was around 20 walls thick. Though he didn't give up and took 4 hours to destroy the city. Only to find I built another walled in city on the other side of the map."
buy this
"If you aren't convinced to by this game, then I got one word to say to you. Wololoooooooooo!"
When I ever i feel like I need an ego boost I just start it up and play against bots on islands as the vikings. 8/8 would boost ego again
You can add new civilization of pacific: 1) Siamese 2) Indonesian 3) Polynesian
Step One: Acquire Game Step Two: Acquire DLC Step Three: Acquire Toilet Seat Step Four: Strap to your buttox Step Five: Hire Butler to hand feed you Step Six: Play AOE2 Step Seven: Profit
One of the best strategy games i have played.
A very good quality upgrade and the new A.I. is way more challengging it`s avery good experience to play with your friends
that game's my childhood!  any questions?
Excellently remastered!
"Age of Empires II HD is an extremely fun and classic strategy game.  It offers a large selection of singleplayer campaigns and its multiplayer is very fun with friends. You build up huge armies, thriving towns and defenses to keep the enemies at bay. The workshop also adds to the game with the oppurtunity to battle on player created warzones.  It's tagged with the 'HD' in the title but it's not really a massive graphical improvement from the original 1999 release. It's pretty much the only con that this game has but don't let it fool you.  I don't usually play a lot of strategy games but this game still appeals to me and has encouraged me to try other strategy games. If that isn't a good reason to buy this game, I'm going to have to destroy your castle. I recommend this game."
"Crashes in multiplayer like every 2nd time. Always some network connection issues. Not only at my pc, but also on friends. Bad coding. After so many years bugs are still not fixed?"
"Literally a timeless game. This game is over 17 years old and is still one of the most solid games ever made. With a new group in charge of updates, it feels like the game can live up to its unknown potential."
The best game made better! HD EDITION! Awesome LAN game! I have never played the campaign but i guess it is also good.
Wo lolo.... Now you want to buy the game
"CLASSIC. If you love strategy games, you cannot miss this one. I don't think I can think of something that hasn't been said about it before, so I'll just leave it at that.  AoE never fails to entertain me though."
Everyone loves AoE2.
Addicting Real Time Strategy classic
"+ Its just that old game, just made playable on new pcs, higher screen size support and steam for multiplayer, remember the zone through msn?  + Mod support with steam workshop (V4 update has made it 100x better)   -V4 update broke mods (They need to be ported/updated) So the chances of old mods being updated are slim  - Multiplayer has SO MUCH LAG but then there would be over 200 units for each player when playing on certain game modes so...   EDIT: Performance of the game has now been fixed, yay!"
Words can't do AOEII justice.
"This game is amazing. Every society has something to like about it, there is alot campaign if you like that kind of thing, and there are plenty of difficulties, modes, and ways to tweak each match to your liking."
"Age of Empires II is a great Real Time Strategy ('RTS') game. The only issue is that the Difficulty settings are a mess in my opinion. Even with Original AI or new AI, if I play Easy or Moderate, it's too easy. If I play Standard or higher, its too difficult. This game if fun with multiplayer -- I have a friend I game with once every 6-8 weeks and its enjoyable. I'd give it a solid 9.2/10, regardless of the difficulty issue."
Many late hours spent playing with friends and the cause of many LAN parties. Also the cause of some feuds.
I was recommended to get this game from a friend and in one day I put 7 hours into it. This game is fantastic. I don't think it is worth $20 dollars but its definitely worth $10 or below. If you have a friend or two who would buy the game with you then I say that it is worth the $20 dollars.
"Loved this game as a kid, still love it these days.  The HD looks amazing, the game runs great, and the new content is pretty on point as well. "
This game.... Is so good cant stop thinking about it!
"fun game, other then some lagging, still works great. worth the buy."
Barely functions
"No lan support, games get desynced, the beginning of the game is really laggy which messes with your build order.  Is no good."
cool
"it's a fun game that may take a little while to get used to, but once you get into it, it gets really fun. being crushed in a second, and winning by miles can be two games one after the other, but it's not like that has anything to do with luck, it's just what the other players and AI do. remember to play your own way and have fun with this game at first, if you want to do some hardcore training later go ahead, but i still say you should play your own way first. remember to have fun, and thank you for reading my rambling description"
"One of the first PC-games I´ve played(the original CD-version). I can say that this is game is one of the best and funniest in the world and it learned me more history than school ever did. Recommended for all players that like nostalgia, history and strategy."
:) 
Played this game since I was small and still not fed up of it!
AMAZING GAME BUT THIS DELAY AND HAVE TO CLICK 4 TIMES ♥♥♥♥ IS ANNOYING I CANT PLAY IN REAL TIME
A true classic that will never go away! A first choice when playing games with my little brother or friends.
"Very fun, it's the Age of Empires II that I always used to love playing! The biggest downside to me is that you can't reload games in multiplayer - I like to play multiplayer, but the reload game function is broken at the moment; and I don't usually have the time to play an ENTIRE game in ONE session. This bug will definitley shorten my play time of this game until it is fixed..... Other than that, though, very fun, and looks much cleaner than the original."
"A classic, now polished and remastered. There's not a lot to say, really. If you've played the original version, then there's only good things to say about some of the new features. Steam Workshop integration is wonderful, and the new, long-awaited expansions only add to the unique feeling of a mixture between nostalgic and new."
"been playing this game since I was like 10 years old, it's epic... play it unless you're an idiot."
A classic always worth to play.
"Still a great game, and the Steam updates have made it even better."
I would like a refund for the game because my computer does not support this game.
"This game was my first game ever, the original not HD edition of course, and it's what started my life of video gaming. I don't think I'd be as into games as I am now if I hadn't played this game when I was about eight or so years old. The graphics aren't the best for this generation of games, but back in windows 98 this game looked beast. I would recommend this game to all my friends as a must play at some point. It's a fun strategy game that hasn't lost it's luster."
"same old classic, I love it"
"A alltime classic, no pre-history games over or the sides. [17.3/20]"
"Age of Empires. What more needs to be said? Strategize the ♥♥♥♥ out of your friends and no more trouble with uhm connecting with your friends on LAN, for we're all connected on steam now."
Best Age Of Empires of all + Multiplayer. Great game.
This game was my childhood. Now it is my adulthood.  10/10 Would Wololo again.
"Absolutely fantastic game! Even though the game is over 15 years old, it still holds its own with the best RTS games of our time. The HD package did a good job of updating graphics to a better quality however, going in you should still know that this game's graphics are still dated and cannot compete with a title such Company of Heroes or StarCraft. That aside, the mechanics and gameplay are so outstanding that this is an essential buy for all RTS players.  I would recommend this game to any RTS fan or anyone looking to get into the genre"
8 man free for all Regicide.
"What is there to say about this game???...an all-time classic, never gets old, and with the new DLCs, it just got better. I recommend it to anyone who likes RTS games, and slashing your way through the ages. 11/10 =)"
"I was going to get off at 9:00pm, but then as i looked at my monk and heard 'WOLOLOLOLO' Something clicked in my brain...  Its 2:30am... the next day. i havent stopped playing.  11/10 would get converted agian."
Possibly the best strategy game ever! Not many problems except for desyncs and players dropping 
"An absolute classic, hours of fun to be had."
This was a very welcomed HD remake. Age of Empires was the first RTS game I played when I was a kid and the remake does the original proud. They kept the game the same while making it look cleaner and run smoother. If you are a fan of any of the original entries in the series this is worth picking up just for the time warp.
This is a awesome game i would love to play more on my free time
"This game is very fun to play with friends, I started the AOE series on the third one so it was quite hard to start on this one but still, very enjoyable."
There are 2 strategy games of all times. One is Age of Empires 2 HD the other is Starcraft 1-2.
in my view the best game in the Age of line up
"The classics rule! I've been playing this game since 2002, when I was 7 , the good thing for AOE2 is that you never get tired of it. the graphics are very comfortable to handle the game, very addictive itself. Highly recommend for those who prefer RTS with amazing action."
Once Again it has been for the most part fixed after the devs broke it
It's so good I bought it twice. yeheheheheheheheha
It's fun but more difficult than Starcraft
Multiplayer can suck if you have a bad connection but the game is awesome.
"Although this game is almost THE carbon-copy of the original which I had been looking for, in the original there was the option to tweak the resolution so that zooming out was possible. This isn't the case here, instead, based on whatever screen resolution you have, that's it. I'm stuck with a view that is way too zoomed in to be enjoyable. Surely they can fix this."
"I expect more 'refresh' Units dont looks as good as buildings, but game is still time consuming as oryginal. Good to buy in promotion but 20 euro is too much for this game. Anyway, good relaxing strategy."
Great game but this version could be better as it sometimes slows down with a lot of action (even on computers with nice specs which can get frustrating. Also needs some balancing as some civs are vastly inferior/superior)
"Good game, remind me of my childhood parfait."
11th commandment : you shall love this game.
9.5/10   Would build another Viking town with 50 monks in it some time to force Europe and the Middle East to convert to Odinism so they can be happier people.
"This is my first game and it got remastered.I played this game when it have horrible graphics and not on steam ah the good times, well i must thank this game and age of empire 3 for introducing me to gaming. I reccomend it"
everything!
Theres 20 knights in my house as I write this review
attacked while a friend was attacking another person.  10/10 would backstab again
A timeless classic I'm still playing 10-15 years later.
Great game i luv it its really well revamped recommended
"It's a classic, clear and simple. Compared to newer strategy games, it's prehistoric, but I would still rather play this. I liked the fact it's concise, anyone (who's a gamer) will easily be able to figure out how to play. But, as I said earlier, it is a classic. This means that it has plenty of problems, such as connection issues and bad graphics. So, if you want to take that step into strategy gaming, then Age of Empires II is a great place to start. It is, in my opinion, the original Strategy Game. Here's my walkthrough of the campaign, feel free to check it out!  http://youtu.be/gp9oP-6rR5o "
A true good old RTS
Great update for a king among classic games. What's not to like?
One of the old best RTS!
A modern update to a classic. Nearly perfect in everyway.
HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON?
Best game ever! I wish Age of empires online was still... well... online. But this one does the job. 
Its a good time
Gotta love the classics man! This was probably the best one in the series. Now in HD? Awesome! On sale? HELL YEAH!
memories not the best game out there but in my oppion its bad ♥♥♥   definely wait and get the expansion pack edition i miss out on alot of cool worlds by not having it   one of my all time favorite games 10 out of 10 to me but im into the old ones more this and risk and the old original sim series
"I have always enjoyed Age of Empires II more than other RTS games of its time. There is no single overpowered unit, and even though strength in numbers is dangerous, there are effective ways to counter large, concentrated armies. The balance between units is brilliant. There are advantages and disadvantages between civilizations, but a skilled player will plan their strategy accordingly to often overcome the disadvantages.  AoE II HD improves some of the graphics and adds a new AI that definitely offers new challenges for players of any level, among other things. Dedicated RTS players must give this game a try if they have never done so."
"This is good, but to charge £15 for a 15 year old game that is still full of bugs and sucky netcode is ridiculous!!!"
Age is great game and hope they keep supporting it was going get this or age 3 my only problem is I play on a hd tv and seems like u can not zoom in or anything but other than that great also does have issues starting up sometime with graphics idk patch please and thank of us playing in living rooms too ;)
"Just amazing game, even though it is old it's just great fun to play. A strategy game you can play with friends and also evolve from nab to pro, what else can you ask? ;)"
Pretty good.   Trebuches suck.   10/10
Great game. I played this a lot as a kid and it is even better than I remember.
I grew up with Age of Empires and it really deserves all the praise it get and i hope others can love it the same way i do.
"Being Able to play this game again is a real treat. When this game first came to steam it was fairly buggy. A majority of the bugs relavent to the steam release have been fixed through updates, making Age of Empires II HD as enjoyable to play as the original."
this game is amazing with the old age civilizations battleing it out and you controll EVERYTHING
fun for the whole family
"Just like my childhood, It lags a little when you build a mass army but its still awesome!"
"A good update, multiplayer works well, nice to be able to use more of the screen res.  Note game still isn't multi threaded, so lags a bit on high pop cap games with lots of players (four players 500 pop cap can become unplayable over the interenet in the same city)"
Age of Empires II is arguably one of the greatest video games ever created for the PC and is a solid must buy for any real time strategy gamer.  It has become an example for which many other RTS titles have come to hold as a standard to emulate over the many years which have passed since this title has released. AoE II isn't too complex as to shave off the casual crowds but isn't too simple as to lose its luster over time. This game has proven to bring back players time and time again over the ages.  With dozens of unique civilizations that harbor their own architectural styles and unique units it is difficult to grow bored whether players stick to the at times difficult campaigns or duke it out against other players online. The gameplay is always changing and the map editor alone offers up unlimited posibilities. Don't pass up the opportunity to purchase this title.  One flaw for some would be buggy achievements at times but nothing that will interfere with the gameplay itself should be expected.
It was very fun revisiting a game i played growing up in higher resolution for a few hours. A must play if you like real time strategy. The problem for me personally is i can't get into it anymore like i did when i was younger because i played and enjoyed several other rts games more since then and i also played this game alot growing up maybe the fatigue is still there. However if you have never played it you should definitely at least try it out. 6/10 (Decent)
What can I say? This is probably one of the greatest strategy games ever made. Play it.
Absolutely Great :)
A good blast from the past. Still fun to play and I like the fact that it has an editor that allows you to create your own maps.
"Age of Empires 2. Where to start?  I have been playing this game for YEARS. Don't let my measly few hours on this game make you think I don't play it much but I have clocked over 200 hours when I was younger. I would not put this and the original AoE down. This game is fantasic. You start off with a few villagers, a town hall and a scout. Not much. And then you have to start building, picking berries, killing sheep and other animals. And that's just for food. You have to chop wood, mine stone, mine gold and then you can start building bigger and better. And then advance through the ages until you build your wonder and keep it for the required time or until you vanquish every enemy team.  There are many different civilisations to choose from. Ranging from Brits to Japanese. And each civ has it's own look for the buildings and different troops. Every civ has the basic swordsman, scout, archer, ETC. However, each one has their own unique troops. Japanese have Samurai and so on...  This game has wasted many hours of my life - and that's a good thing.  If I am totally honest, the price is asking a bit too much £15 for this gem. Yes it may be much but usually on sale it's 75%-80% off which brings it to around £3 (about $5 I think) so pick it up when it is on sale. It is an ancient gem that is still amazing even today. And not to mention the vast amount of mods for this game: Texture replacers, new maps, resource mods and so on. I would actually rate this game 10/10 which is very rare from me. Thank you for reading the review."
"just get it. its like the original game, only with widescreen support and some minor tune up in graphics. also, if you like to use the cars for fun, the cheat is working. actaully, all the cheats are working."
"Not really HD, but still! Is the best game ever. And multiplayer sucks a lot, worked better on a 56K modem."
"apparently it is not supported on windows xp was able to play the game for a while, used to have it on disc was a great game."
I'm really surprised at how much I've enjoyed this game. I like the different options which are available. Haven't had any CTD issues yet. Lots of mods right here on Steam.
This game keeps crashing on the start menu. Why would a consumer buy another license when the platform can't support it?
its so bad its funny
"Old-school addictive fun; Age of Empires II brings back nostaligia of my earlier years, but with revamped graphics that do not ruin the character of the old game. Although dated, this real time strategy is still more fun that ever, with online lobbies bustling so it's easy to find or create a game within a few minutes. I would reccomend this game even to those who are new to AoE. Just beware newcomers, the online lobby is a harsh place and you may have to get used to loosing a lot of games!  However, this game is not without it's faults. Both offline and online, this game has a few bugs. Nothing that is a deal-breaker, but nonetheless you will spot a few if you put a few hours into this game. To name but a few, units getting stuck in the graphics, AI players donating you resources that they don't even have (even if they are your opponents!) This happened during an offline game, and both myself and the AI had no market, so this should not have been possible even if they did try to send me resources... Online gameplay can sometimes be ruined if bad connections are apparent between players, the most irritating of which are when the game hangs and can't be quit without killing the games process in Windows Task Manager and rebooting it. Also, if someone goes out of sync in the game, everyone in that game looses rank, this can be quite substantial and is extremely unfair to the team that may have won the game fair and square.  Other than those small issues, this does not stop me from putting stupid amounts of hours into this game. It's a good laugh, very fun to play, and it's very, very addictive. You have been warned!"
"The developers unfortunately still have NOT fixed the lag issues, and the game becomes unplayable in single player random map mode. Right when the AI starts saying 'everyone attack now' the game lags BIG time. It is ABSOLUTELY unplayable. Its been months and months after the release and still this fundamental problem exists. If you are a fan of the old game I would recommend sticking to the older version. Don't waste money on this money grabbing half-finished product"
The game keeps crashing on me with this new up date. Is this happenign to anyone else?
Really fun campaign and single player gameplay :D
A true classic. This game is just as fun as I remember. The multi-player is awesome. I could play it for hours.
classic game.
It's so the ♥♥♥♥.
"One of the greatest computer games of all time. Im VERY dissapointed to have to give it this rating for the fact that at high resolution on my computer everything is too small and impossible to read. If resolution scaling problem was handled properly i would reccommend this game to EVERYONE but it is very hard to play a game without being able to read your resources, see your units, and everything in general being too small."
"I've been a huge Age of Empires fan since the time each game in the series came out. I played them to death, so I was sceptical if I should buy the HD version. I feared the HD update would not be enough.  Well, actually it was. The game runs smoothly and the widescreen native resolution is awesome. While the game is probably not worth it's full price, but I bought it on sale for a miserable 5 euros, so it was basicaly a no-brainer.  Age of Empires II is a real-time strategy game, set in real-life middle ages. You build your empire, forge powerful armies consisting of infantry, archery, cavarly, trebouchets and much more. You can choose to counquer you enemies by force, of 'force them to submit to your rule' (as I call it :P ) by building a wonder. You can also choose from multiple civilizations, throughout the world. There are numerous campaigns, such as the legendary Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Barbarossa and many more.  In short, build a mighty empire and conquer your enemies in Age of Empires II!"
They kept what was good while strongly improving the Multiplayer and adding new ok-ish scenarios.
thank you for the remake!!!! Takes me back to when life was simple and I was 18!
very disappointed. very glitchy. gl to the people that buy the expacs
"When I was a young lad, I was first given this game. Since then, I have molded into a human cyborg. One with the game. Alternatively, the game has taught me as much as I have taught it. emag eht htiw enO. Now, I weep in victory as my foes fall to their knees, where I, the champion, penetrate the fears of the elderly in order to one day unit human cyborgs and humans. Needless to say this game is a-f***ing-mazing."

After all that years still an amazing game. The online community is vibrant enough to never let you wait to long to join an online match and the workshop brings awesome community made mods into the game easily.  The downside is the heavy lags and desyncs that happen all to often when playing online.
"Great game but don't buy it if you are hoping to use the map editor to make custom scenarios, it's a nightmare. Tons of problems with multiplayer in generl as well. I am very dissapointed to say that I wouldn't reccomend buying this game."
"I have played this game for over 10 years now and I haven't disliked the game even once. They outdid themselves with the HD Edition with Steam features and easier connection to online games than the previous version of Age of Empires 2.   The only bad thing I could say about this game are the players you get set up with during online. Like any game you can be in the same game as a spammer who constantly writes voice commands and the people don't really cooperate as a team during team games.   + HD graphics + Use of Steam Workshop (add mods to your game to add different in-game music, different re-skins to buildings, units and the environment and custom scenaios for you to play) + DLC (though expensive) offfers more civiliazations, maps and more strategies to the game.   - Annoying online players (50/50 okay and bad to play with) - Largely based in the States so if you are in another country you'll get a higher ping than them and are most likely to be kicked from their game session. - If you increase the game speed to x8 the AI will get stuck in the trees. - AI can be stupid, but you can download a free new AI from the player Resonance23 which is 100x better  How I would rate the game, I wouldn't say a numerical number but one sentence instead. 'Why haven't you bought it yet?'"
Reliving childhood.. Love the game
"It's AoE II but zoomed out. Dodge The Forgotten expansion, it's rubbish. The African Kingdoms is so-so.  I only bought this because my AoE II discs got scratched. :("
"This game consumes hours of your life, battling online is fun when the lag keeps at bay and overall the campaign is great, loved it as a kid still love it today"
"Should be the standard for all RTS's, one of the greats."
Childhood relived :)
"It's everything awesome that I remember from 1999 plus more since I never actually owned the Conquerors expansion (which comes with a base purchase of AoE II Extended Edition). There were some serious issues with performance and stuttering when it was first released but they seem to have rectified it for the most part as of writing this. The Steam Workshop integration is great and full of lots of good mods. If you were a big fan of the original like I am and would like to play it smoothly on modern hardware, this is $20 well spent."
"Best RTS I've ever played, my time played truely doesn't reflect the hours upon hours I used to play this game as a kid. 10/10 would recommend"
"This was an amazing game back in the day, it is even better now due to the addition of DLC and it being on steam. This a great buy for anyone."
One of my all time favourite games! worth all your money! buy it! I've been playing on and off for about 14 years!
Saladin where are you going with that great ar-
"For new player this game may be very unintuitive and therefore frustrating. You must actually spend many hours just to learn how play it.. really! Its in fact not even 'game' but 100% interactive movie, even combat is made from animations of fight. Am actually don't believe this sword touch anything in surrounding, you just click different objects to play different animations and that is all 'game' If you are not fan of movie, character and story they you may possibly bounce off from it like ball from wall. Don't expect anything whatsoever like Elder Scrolls, Gothic, Risen etc. it should have own category its that different."
"This game is supprizingly awesome for such an old game. This is a case of : graphics don't matter .. even though it is the HD version it still looks kinda bad but heck with that, the gameplay is awesome.. great fun when having a LAN-party :)  10/10"
"This game is fantastic, I highy recommend this to anyone who enjoys RTS games."
You know you want to buy this quallity 1999 High definition shiz.
its goes boo when you type 9/11. never forget. ~Wololo~
"***Please Note that i have played this game for nearly 6 years before purchasing this on steam***    ***General Analasys of the game***   AOE II HD Edition is a Strategy game based in the ancient era, players must collect resources to build their empire and create units that are used to build, and protect you're empire in which you will engage in tremendous battles that if you are a good player will last hours it seems. Players will be able to engage in diplomatic activities such as trading resources for needed ones, (Wood to create houses for iron to create warriors). In the end you will be either a winner or a loser weather you are either of these determines the skill you produce.    ***My opinion on the game***  I highly recommend this game, for the $19.99 you will spend can never amount to the fun you will have while playing this Everything that is in this game is just awesome for it's time, me and my school-mates  Would all join a local server and battle it out as we all ate our lunch, in a group of about 8 or 9 of us would play until we we're defeated then we would log out and the remaining players would keep battling until eventually a winner emerged It's been so long since we did this but the winner got a nice prize for winning and it was usually my good friend Ryan :)  we'd sometimes find ourselves ingulfed in this game to the point the school board took the computers out of our school. This is where it gets a little off topic but im sure you will think this is pretty neat. One day we all came to school stoked on lunch time so we could all see who's been training the most. At about 12:00 PM we all went to the battle-room  This is what we called it :), just to find out that 90% of our computers had been taken away by the school board and only 2 remained with locked passwords so none of us could access it, and anyone who could access it was  indefintely not allowed to play AOE II, so a bunch of young lads we we're bent out of shape by this and one of our teachers who had actually played with us, came forth and encouraged that we played this game, considering it was educational, it gave us a brief understanding of ancient civillizations, and organization. Which i would occasionally speak forth about. Eventually we had a huge debate imploring that they put the computers back, but they thought it had  brought us away from the academic system, only to later find out that it gave us a great understanding of history. With some help from my teacher we ended up getting our computers back, and remained playing AOE II till we had  graduated from the school i was attending.    ***Moral of the story*** This game is 100% worth the hard earned money that you are paying, i would never sit here and tell you otherwise this game gave me confidence in myself and also made me understand that even though you may be the best at something their is always someone better. Which is beautiful i think. So please buy this game because its too good to not buy.     God Speed ladys and gents."
Its great fun
"Age of Empires II was literally the gateway game to all strategy games I've ever played. The HD edition along with the Forgotten makes the game a lot better. It's still a vibrant game after more than 10 years and still the same game as I used to remember it. I bought the game (the original Age of Kings) back in 1999 when I was a kid for about $50. Expensive, I know, but the game was an eyeopener. It literally turned me into a PC gamer for life. It's literally the magnum opus of all the Age of Empires games."
thish gayme is leyke pehtting a ferreee kihten. when i pway et oi git all teawy up insheyed and strangle myshelf. ehrrrrrrrrrrr
I do like this game with HD maps and beter support for windows 7 had no problems so far Good Game :)
Most balanced RTS of all
Best game of all time.
The most awesome and greatest game ever in history!!!
Addicting version of Civilization for Windows 96.
It it really fun sinagle player and MultiPlayer
I changed the religion of a house. 10/10 would convert again.
I was so happy seing this game on steam! I loved playing it when I was a kid and im gonna love playing it today!!!
"I have been playing the AOE franchise for the majority of my life. I first saw my sister's husband play this game when I was about 11 years old and I think it was the reason I can say I am a gamer to this day. I was inspired to build my first PC for this game as the only thing I had at the time was 486 POS that wouldn't run anything worth playing. After many months of saving every little bit of money I could, I built a badass Pentium 166 that could run the original AOE. I probably put 2000 hours into that game at the very least.   But this is a review for AOE 2, isn't it? As soon as I knew this was coming out, I had it firmly in my radar. I picked it up immediately and put several thousand more hours into it. It was great then and it is even better now. The new campaigns, the HD upgrade, the old stuff, it is all here and epic as hell. There isn't much I can say about the gameplay, story, and mechanics that hasn't already been said. It game is perfection. I just absolutely love it and I think anyone who is into RTS games has to play this game.   10/10 A must have for any steam library."
I've had this masterpece since i was a kid... like 5... Still one of the Greatists RTS in the known Universe and the HD just makes it all the better
A spectacular game with a learning curve but enjoyable nonetheless
"Classic RTS, almost therapeutic to play. Cheesesteak Jimmy's for life, son."
Always a game I thought about when I was younger but did not have a computer to run it. It does not disappoint! It gives the old time strategy game feel while still being challenging.
"My first video game I bought with weeks of allowance... Great memories, and they did a great job modernizing it and making it all pretty while still staying true to the greatness of the game"
"Age of the Empires II is a timeless classic. In general I would highly recommend this game. If you already own the original Age of Empires II, however, I'm not sure if its worth the investment. There are surely mods available to provide the gameplay added and packeged by steam. This applies to the additional content too, I imagine. Furthermore, the improved graphics doesn't eliminate the fact that the game appears a bit dated, but it makes the in-game experience a little bit better.  Nonetheless the inexpensive asking price, the quality of the game, and the lack of time and effort required in acquiring these mods make me content with the investiment.  Finally, I might recommend 0 AD, as this appears to be the next generation of what AOE started. Tis 3D and incorporates the spirit of the AOE and AOE II games."
"Ahhh the memories,   Pro: Never get's old, strategy is endles Con:bought for online but few people still play  Start paying already so i can go against randoms rather then friends! :-) "
"Exceptional RTS Game. Wonky game engine, otherwise a perfect game."
After all those years!
"Summary: A great rerelease for a great strategy game. Truly one of my favorites.  This game is a great throwback to my childhood. I fondly remember sending my armies of knights and archers into battle when I was young, and I feel that same sense of joy doing it here. Here are some of the things I liked and disliked:  Good:  -Still the same game: Not much has been changed since I last played, which is great for the most part. I loved the game back in the day, and this is pretty much the same thing. The most notable thing I can see is an update to the AI. It seems much more intelligent and responsive than I remember, and my friends and I had some trouble when we played some games against the harder difficulty levels. -Multiplayer: Easy to figure out, and a lot of fun playing some games with friends who also remember playing as kids. -Graphics: I didn't notice too much of a change, but after looking at some side by side photos I can see the details look a lot sharper.  Bad: -Still the same game: I would have liked to see a bit more added content. This was already a very full game with hours and hours of play time when it was released, but I would have liked to see a bit more with the remaster. This was an opportunity to build off of a great base game, and I would have liked to see more added.  Bottom-Line: I had a super great time reliving the good old days. It's still as great as it was back in the day, which was a whole lot of fun. While I would have liked to see a bit more, I still think it's worth a pickup for anyone who loved it years ago, or anyone who wants to play a straightforward and enjoyable strategy game."
"Age of Empires II finally comes back to us.  After the travesty that was Age of Empires III, I am glad we got a remastered version of Age of Empires II. It still has the nostalgic look and feel, so I would recommend it for people who played it back when it first came out. However, newcomers will probably better appreciate other games with better graphics and AI."
"This game never grows old. I even prefer it to AoE III. The achievements are plenty, and though some are challenging, none are so difficult as to be unobtainable."
"Absolutely fantastic game. Nostalgia plays a role, sure, as I grew up with this, but the game is still great.  The graphics are fine, but it really isn't the reason why anyone would play Age of Empires. If you're reading this and haven't heard of or played it before, I can only tell you this: it's easy to learn, the pace is set by the players (you can go slooooow or lightning fast when developing your empire), the strategy element is wonderful (there is ALWAYS a way to beat that obnoxious friend with the 'perfect strategy') and there are tons of ways to set up your empire in a way that suits you best.  When I play AoE with my friends, you can immediately identify each of ur empires by its looks. Not just the skins of the different factions, but rather the layout of our empires.  Amazing game, well worth it. I'd pay 60 bucks for this, easy. If you like strategy games, playing with friends (or just messing around on your own) and exploding suicide monkeys, buy Age of Empires II."
"Really good game, enjoyed a whole bunch, best played multiplayer, if u came here for campaign go get age of empires III, dosent hae that good of gameplay or graphics, and when i say gameplay i mean the characters movements are a little choppy, but i say that dosent matter its still a great game.  10/10 would reccomend this game."
"What a great game! If you like RTS games based in the Ages, then you'll grow in age pretty quickly playing this. &gt;Fun &gt;You can build a lot of different ♥♥♥♥. &gt;You can kill-off your own team makes. &gt;Great chat-lines with voices. &gt;Still as good as it was about 17 years ago. &gt;And I'm cutting this review short, just so I can go back and play more!"
"All the nostalgia, loads of workshop content, depressingly quick AI and more elite longbowmen than my TIME computer could ever handle back in '02"
One archer can't hit anything. One hundred archers can't miss ;)
"Great game, brings back childhood memories but not as gold as AOE Rise Of Rome"
This game is the reason I play PC games.
greate game cant stop playing it. would recomend it to anyone who likes stratagy games.
This game is a great throwback. I love playing with my friends and even agasint the (modded) AI. The only problem I have with the game is the multiplayer. Getting kicked out of every room because you haven't played multiplayer in 8 years it's sad. Obviously not the games fault but if you are wanting to play online make sure you tell everyone you're using a smurf.
Good ole AOE2.  Pro: It's AOE2 Con: It's AOE2  Overall 10/10
"This one went up fast because I’ve already had a chance to sink 20+ hours into in the preceding weeks. I was no newcomer to the RTS genre, but I was a newcomer to the Age of Empires franchise until my girlfriend bought us each a copy while it was on sale during the Steam Summer Sale. And am I glad that she did.  Age of Empires II: HD Edition is (as the name would suggest) the high definition remake of the classic RTS game Age of Empires II from Hidden Path Entertainment and Ensemble Studios.  The Good  I’ll be very straightforward here: I’m not very good at RTS games. That being said, I still thoroughly enjoy playing RTS games, despite my lack of strategic wisdom. While old, AoE2 is a fun, addictive game. You have a vast array of civilizations to chose from (each featuring their own cultural advantage, unique unit(s), and some have access to technologies that others do not), good graphics, and simple controls. The point here is that you have lots of options. Options are a good thing. A very, very good thing.  Combat is easy enough to understand: certain units are strong against certain units, etc. If you bring a bunch of cavalry to a polearm fight, you’re going to have a bad time. And, yes, that is bitter experience talking. However, even when the chips are down for you, the struggle to survive is still fun. The desperate scrambling to gather resources and pump out units to replace your annihilated army has a certain charm to it.  The Bad  While I understand the graphical limitations of the days in which this game was originally released, with this version being the high def remake, I was saddened to see that most units look largely the same for every civilization. This excludes unique units (hence the unique part) and the buildings do change a bit depending on what your civilization’s culture is like and what part of the world they’re from.  The Meh  See above.  Verdict: Yea  Age of Empires II: HD Edition is a great game and the first game we’ve been able to recommend since our return from hiatus. If I hadn’t have received it as a gift, I wouldn’t have felt bad about buying it. If you’re a fan of the franchise or a fan of RTS, this may be a great investment for you. As always, thanks for reading."
"Man the French campaign is so hard, I got stuck on the mission on trying to destroy 3 castles. Nevertheless, this is one of those timeless strategy classics."
Recommended to all mah frendz n fans
"I love this game in all its simplicity. No fancy units just build a big army, navy or both and break stuff! Yes, the AI isn't very clever and depending on how many units you are trying to move, you have to help them do the most basic of things like going somewhere but for me, that's one of the charms. For me, at my age? Simple is GOOD. This one is in my top 3 favorite RTS games."
why erro 53???
"Any game that is still fun after 10 years is a sucess. One day I know it will be deleted from my hard drive, but I just cant bring myself to do it now."
Brings back lots of memories from the past.   Very glad I bought this game :))  
A classic strategy game that'll have you hooked for hours on end. It's not easy though so be prepared to rage quit a few times.
"While an amazing game I would try to find it on Disc via an updated version. The QA people missed a lot of issues made in the port. The Joan of Arc levels are particulary annoying. Love the game, but don't like for steam."
Old but gold. One of the best RTS ever. They don't make games like that anymore.
"It brings you back to the good ol' days ...almost. They were lazy with this remake, they basically just made it pretty but did little to actually make the game any better. If its cheap and you loved the old game then grab this one."
"Very nice game, just like the classic game, but even better!"
"Easily one of my favorite games of all time. If you like RTS games, this is the grandfather of them all. I love this game"
"This is one of my childhood games, a great game to pass the time! "
"One of my favouite games of all time. It has aged so so well. It was fun and addicting at age 10 and still is now aged 20. Plenty of Mods, information, single player battles and fun to play with friends. Just and amazing game overall."
"Good game, very flexible playstyles, good matchmaking (ELO) and fun to play. But very unoptimised, in games with more than 4 players it will become so laggy that micromanagment in battles isn't possible.  Bought it on sale, but wouldn't buy it for a full price...  FIX IT!!!"
"I played this game when I was 2 and loved it and I am still playing it. I would have at least over 100,000 hours on this game if I were playing it on steam but I only had the disk. It is loads of fun and the Campaign is really good too. I play with my friends and we have lots of fun. Quality may be bad, but go on the workshop and look for texture packs I use Ozharas Texture pack v2 and it is good. for over 14 years of my life I have been playing this game. It will never get old. But I also am a massive RTS player. I recommend this game till the day I die"
"One of the great classics of real time strategy that remains alive in the hearts of many of us, even though we may have moved on to more complex and sophisticated games from the Total War series and the Paradox Interactive games like Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings.   The fact that the game has been expanded and made better by fans just makes the game even better and more enjoyable if you remember anything since the last time you played, probably ages ago. One can try to relive the entertaining campaigns adding the new features made by fans of this HD Edition or face real players in Multiplayer mode, be it standalones or in teams.  More factions and units to play with, and some new techologies and skins for the new civilizations give more diveristy for people who remember the standard northern European buildings on one side and the Arabic ones on the other. It has been years since I last played this game, yet I already have over 100 hours reliving the 'old-school epicness' that Aoe 2 had given me over ten years ago."
Great Game!
Cool game. I dare you to 1v1 me ;)
great game!

"Age of Empires II HD (AoE2) is a real-time strategy game set in periods ranging between 500-1500AD, roughly. Originally released in 1999, this is the re-released HD edition, featuring enhanced graphics and AI (though is otherwise identical to the original release).  The base game + conquerors expansion (i.e. excluding new expansions) offers the player campaigns from several civilisations which follow the path of documented history (more or less), with each scenario often being dramatically different from the next. For example, a scenario may require the player to quickly form a base and defend it against attack, and then take the fight to the enemy(ies), or, perhaps you are given a large military force to begin with and must make your way through the map, capturing more units as you go, to get to a final destination. This variation keeps the player on their toes and interested in playing the next scenario. Before you know it, you'll have completed all of the base game campaigns and will have moved onto the expansions!  The tutorial campaign is an excellent introduction into the basic aspects of the game, but is lacking in advanced features (surprise surprise). It serves to introduce complete RTS noobs into the genre and does so quite well, with a reward 7 part tutorial campaign.  If you've not played this game (shame on you and your childhood), and you haven't played RTS games before, buy it! There are hundreds of hours in the campaigns alone and they are great fun and genuinely educational. If you have played RTS games before and liked them, I suspect you've already bought this, as any respectable human would.  The new expansions (released only for this HD edition) are both good, introducing several new and interesting civilisations, like the Indians, Italians, and Slavs. The campaigns for both expansions are of a comparable quality to the conquerors campaigns, but fall short of the main game campaigns. Well worth it if you like the game and want more of the same.  Random map games are the bread and butter of AoE2. These are where the player chooses a civilisation and alters the game information. You can customise most features of a game, including the victory conditions, map type, player count, team affiliations, starting resources, game speed, population cap etc. The player can choose between the original AI (loaded with the game on original release) or the improved AI, which is much harder; the player can also select between several difficulties as well, for quite a fine resolution of choices.   Multiplayer battles follow the same format as random map battles. There is a strong multiplayer community going and there are always tons of games to pick from; games can include random people, friends and AI members as well.   In addition to the suite of gameplay features, maps, campaigns, civilisations and multiplayer which could keep you occupied for thousands of hours, there are also really excellent overviews of each civilisation. Each overview is a historical synopsis of the civilisation and is always interesting to read, containing dates, people, places and famous wins and losses.   There is also a strong modding community with some nice graphical mods, gameplay mods and even some extra content.  I must have played hundreds upon hundreds of hours of this game when I had the original release, and the new additions don't so much as 'add' to the game, but more updates it to modern conventions of gaming. This is a very good rerelease for that reason. There's was no reason to dramatically alter the formula when it was working so wonderfully, and this is the result.   There are few games which you get quite as good value for money in terms of hours/currency; an excellent old game which has stood the test of time valiantly.   Metacritic for AoE2HD = 68%; Metacritic for original release = 92%; My score = 90%."
"This game changed my life!  After i started playing this game i didnt pay attention to my enviroment... I lost touch with my wife, my children, my pets... first my wife wanted to leave after she noticed me not going to work... she took the children with her. My dog died of starvation and my cat ate parts of his body. I wanted to change, but i just could not resist playing this addicting game. I lost all of my life while playing this game... for extraordinary 57 hrs... i dont know what to do with my life anymore please help me."
Just like the good old days but easier to use multiplayer
Great Game :)
So many fun times in this game. 
Hard to believe such an old game could still be so much fun to play. This game is all of the wins :3
"Any1 who like strategy game, will enjoy AoE2 :) I can't stop playing."
A classic game that I grew up with. I remember playing this with cousins and friends. I love the fact that it has returned unchanged.
Its AOE 2. Just play it. Its amazing.
"Amazing game, bit old for its time but still has the same feeling it had when i was a kid. love it. buy and play"
The best RTS ever created!
:)
Just like I remembered it from my childhood.
Much hours spent on this very good game. Very friendly low spec game players
"I remember playing this a lot when it was first released when I was younger. Well not much has changed, and it brought back all the old flare I used to remember when playing this (with friends especially). Graphics are a definate improvement although it really doesn't matter much because the game play is what this franchise is known for."
"Ahh classic AoE 2, sooo many hours playing this game. Good times :)"
"Extremely addictive game, takes a while to get good, still can't win a match online."
"Epic Game. Must have for any RTS person, and a must have for anyone who knows an RTS person.   I beg Steam to find a way to make this cross platform. That would make this the greatest game of all time on Steam I have no doubt.   "
"Great game, large enough community to get into balanced games within 15 minutes. Better games on the forgotten expansion expecially the no rush gamemode unfortunatly not as many people are online to play games all day but in the evenings just as quick to get into good games"
"Age of Empires II was one of my child hood favorites, if you're a fan of RTS games you will love this game. Not much difference overall in the HD version, but I bought it in the steam sale what included the new DLC and Age of Empires III, this game will keep you entertained for hours with the campaign and the never ending battles."
A must have game for any Sheep-enthusiast that feels under-represented in normal games.
This is an exelent RTS. 10/10
Awesome game...Classic...Been playing for YEARS...
classic strategy game
"when you wololo it again, and again...."
"This game takes you back in time and it's realy great, same as the original game only with a slightly better graphic.  THE big downfall with this game is and i repeat: lag lag lag lag.  I have a computer with 32 GB RAM, Nvidia 980, and i7 6700K and it's not cause of my machine.  When you reach population of 200 it' horrible to play it.  If you set population to 500 and fulfill that, it's unplayable (1 picture each sec)  It seems like they knew this, but didn't give a **** And just realeased, and then waited to all nostaliga players bought it.   And it makes me so angry, such a fine game. it's been like this for around 2 years now and they haven't bothered to doing anything about it. neither can they, they have to re-engineer the whole game to make it unlaggy (it's still built with the old game engine) The funny thing is, the neewer PC you have. the worse is the game.   Download the old game and play there if you dont bother MP...."
Very laggy! My pc plays dota2 on highest resolution and yet this game from the previous decade is lagging as hell.
"Wolololololo, your on my side now."
First ever PC game I played. Had to buy the HD version.
its the best RTS game ever!
"The dullness affecting the RTS market since Starcraft 2 came out would itself be a most valid reason to own and stick to this masterpiece. I am not going to spend many words on AoE 2 (a game I've been constantly playing since the very day it was available in my local game shop), thus I'll just say that if you are looking for endless replayability, a challenge that can still appeals to newbies and pr0s alike, a solid campaign, one of the most prolific modders community and the possibility to convert a ♥♥♥♥ing catapult to your cause go for this game now.  Only con:  HD steam version lacks LAN multiplayer option and in the end you'll probably need the old version for it BUT this offers you a proper online ladder so you can close an eye on that"
14: Start the game already!
Now we just need age of empires original + Rise of Rome and maybe new content... wink wink nudge nudge.
Lan not working at all.
Is fun...It was one of the #1 game i ever played...
It's a great game!
This game freezes up
"Never had any issues with bugs in this game, so I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. Don't forget to check out the soundtrack mods because they totally change the overall feeling of battle. Having Kill la Kill's, 'Don't Lose Your Way' blasting while charging into the enemy's army is crazy fun. Not to mention playing with friends only makes the entire experience better. Even if RTS games aren't your specialty, buy this game. You'll get better with time and it only gets more fun."
"Setting fire to stone buildings and castles with swords and pikes since 1999! Now in proper resolution. One of the greatest strategy games from the days of old and a good nostalgia trip to most of us. Probably won't appeal to the younger audience but if you like RTS games in general give it a go, you might just like it."
It's aight.
"The HD remake will run on your machine true: but it still feels like an RTS made in 1999. I had to squint to see some of the buttons on my 1440 monitor. Hard to play, would only recommend to die hard AoE2 fans, wherever they may be.  3/10"
WONT EVEN LET ME PLAY IT 
"an extract from a recent game I played with a friend:  friend: i'm gonna attack the enemy with some monks!  me: oh ♥♥♥♥. imagine if the monks screamed 'the power of christ compels you' whilst attacking.  friend: *loses it*  great singleplayer, even better multiplayer.  10/10 would recommend. "
"There's not much to say here. It's literally Age of Empires II updated to run on modern computers, with Steam integration. The 'HD' moniker is a bit misleading; while it does run at HD resolution, there's no significant graphical overhaul here. There's some new content, but it's separate from the base game.  It's obscenely overpriced for what amounts to a source port, though, so definitely catch it on sale."
"Just like i remember it, amazing, just wow!"
Wololo
Used to play AoE II years ago and came back for the HD edition. I thought I was ok but the new AI smash me. More practice needed..
"Suckle My Pickle, Childhood game c: "
"Everything you loved about it back then, but now just as it says, HD. It's great to return to one of the classics, especially one I didn't think I'd get to play again on an updated PC so you could imagine my pleasure when it was not only on steam, but on sale at the time during the holiday season. Great game then, great game now. If you like RTS and haven't played this yet, you are missing out."
AoE HD is exactly the same as it always was...the only difference is it supports amazing wide screen (read 5760x1024) and updated textures and audio files. It was amazing 10 years ago and it's still amazing today.
"Getting the upgraded version of this game thru Steam has enabled me to 'relive those thrilling days (and nights) of yesteryear', a quote from the opening of the Lone Ranger tv show starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. The game's wide range of choices and the details allow you to immerse yourself fully into the adventure and derring-do of those moments of history. It's another winner for PC gamers !!!"
"AOE II is legitimately one of my favorite games ever. I'm highly disappointed to say that the new AI for AOE II HD ruins the game for me. It lacks the finesse and logic of the original Random Map AI. The enemy AI seems to be mostly okay, except that even when diplomacy is enabled, they do not even propose neutrality. The Ally AI is useless, and the supposed 'Original AI' setting, is remarkably different then the AI in the original game. Frankly this overhaul, though infused with great ideas, seems like an amateur mess."
ITs really good but the price is pretty high
10/10
21/420  got rushed by plummed archers. 
Awesome game! Play more and advise to your friends
"Classic brought back to life. You gotta love this stile of game, not much of my stile, I kinda bought it because a bunch of friends bought it too. Even so, I had lots of fun playing with friends."
i choose korea because glorious leader kim jong un is gud also giant ships with armor
Very close to the original Age of Empires 2. The main thing I have noticed is that the CPU AI difficulty was toned down a little. This change takes a little bit of getting used to.
hello childhood.
Bought for the nostalgic factor. Still amazed how it holds up nowadays. 7/10
"I have really mixed feelings about this game.  The Conquerors was the best expansion and these two expansions are not too bad but still they could be good.   I would recommend buying this game but there are few problems that developers should fix. The game have some lag issues. It's like playing MOBA game with ping even tho i played offline with AIs.   And another problem is path finding. I remember there was no problem on the Conquerors. It all started when HD came out. Especially in crowded, complicated maps like jungles, black forest and campaign maps units are often stuck behind a tree where they could easily get past.  Other than these 2 issues there is no problem with this game. (Well, there are some bugs too..)  "
"Absolute classic, runs perfect for me and i use bare minimum requirements so glad i found this game even better i get to enjoy it in HD!"
"It may be old, but better than most new crap on this Steam store."
Exactly like how I remembered it to be. :')  AoE 2 and Westwood RTS games were my childhood.   10/10 for wololo.
This game blows ducks.
"Very nice game , well done developers."
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT THIS STATE! -------------------------------------------- After playing 20 minutes SinglePlayer vs 3 Bots, the game strats to stutter, it is not my PC I am running GTX 750Ti 8GB RAM AMD FX6300 3.4ghz six core CPU.  This stutter problem is a problem that everyone who plays single player is expiriencing, and developers are not even planning to fix it."
Game was unplayable upon release but they have patched all problems.  Thank you Microsoft for another great addition to a great game!
"Loved this game as a kid playing it on LAN with my family and love this game now as an adult, playing it solo and online. The classics will never get old for me. The gameplay is pretty fair and it's easy to run on mobile devices, especially if you're on a business trip and want to kill time (or the Britons/Franks). It's nice that they updated this game to run on newer systems since my old disks required a patch to make it playable on newer versions of Windows."
"I've loved this game since my early childhood. Started playing it since I was five, and now that I finally have it on Steam I am glad to say that it's only gotten better with age."
Newest expansion made my main menu pink.  10/10.
Wrecking fools
Its a classic!  Graphics are not up to date but damn the strategy is deep.
Wall.. I like building walls!
this game is awsome i sugest getting it 
Awesome older Strategiegame. Had alot of fun playing it with friends.
I played that game when i was child ~10-12 years ago. One of my first strategy game after Starcraft &amp; Expension: Blood War. This games remember me my childhood. Im not the PRO at this game but still i like it and i enjoy it. Maybe one day ill try the AOE III
One of the best RTS games out! Played it a ton on the non-steam version.
MONK! I NEED A MONK!
You don't know a good real-time strategy game if you haven't played (and fell in love with) this.
"Good game, would recommend!"
For a HD remake you would think it would be HD looks like im still playing on the PS2
"I played this game a lot when I was a child. old memories come to mind &lt;3 I recommend to play this, because it is the best stradegia game, if you are a big fan of creating infinity stuff, this game is a good choice because you can create a realy crazy armies and destroy the enemy city."
Great Game
"I spent most of the time playing the skirmish mode offline and remembered why I always loved RTS games and the Age of Empires series. AOE II is a good game because playing it makes time fly by. When you think you have played for an hour and it was really three or four, the game must be doing something right. Is the AI perfect? No, but that seems like an issue with every Age of Empires game - and every RTS game I have played. AOE II is very addicting, fun, and recommended!"
Love it
Berries. That is all you need to know
The remake of a masterpiece. What I would like to see is the same work on the first AOE.
Only the hardened veterans and the fleeting nostalgists remain.
"I still own the original CDs for AOE2 and the expansion, Conquerors. Bought it back in 2000 when I was a freshman in HS. Great game and now with HD version, I can relive those great times with friends now. One of the best RTS games out there. Buy it and play it."
"Honestly I love it. Great game, ver since a little kid I loved rts games and this really set the standard for alot of them. I plan on paying this games as much as I did when I was little. It may be the nostalgia but I love it!"
"Grew up playing this game and somehow lost my disk about 10 years ago. Thankfully some smart person Thought 'Hey, let's bring back AOE2 and Remaster it'  To whoever had the idea to remake it: 'THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK MY CHILDHOOD. Also..... WOOLLOOLOOO'  10/10"
its so much fun :D &lt;3
Pretty much my childhood. I love this game so much. The epitome of a well made RTS.
You should all buy this right now.
"It may be old but it holds itself quite well and owns nothing to any other newer game of its genre. Well made mechanics, pleasant soundtrack, very user-friendly interface and comes with a level editor for the players to create their own maps as they please if they get bored of the game's singleplayer campaigns. Speaking of singleplayer, the game also features multiplayer. You can ally with friends to win a map or battle between yourselves to see who's the best strategist. Hours and hours of fun are granted with this classic from the 90's. And if you need a break, the game allows you to save your progress on a map whenever you wish and resume from where you left off. Definitely a must-have if you like strategy games. Best strategy game of all time!"
"like the old aoe2, but shinier"
"Game is great, so glad they remastered this on steam"
Started playing this game 15 years ago. You'll never get tired from this one!
This is a great game. Lots of enhancements to the original.
"If you liked the original AoE 2, you should probably buy this. It's that simple really; there's nothing special about this version except for the HD part.  A solid 8/10, because it's Age of Empires 2, a great strategy game both for its time and today."
Roses are red Wololo Roses are blue
"Gamis fantastic, still as fun as it was when I first played it a long time ago."
Good old style AOE game!
"  Insanely fun game that's a joy to play with friends and at LAN parties. Takes some getting used to and can be difficult to learn the full meta, but is a load of fun once you're at least decent at it."
good game... always play it and nostalgia
"One of the first PC game I've ever played.  I love this game, even though the devs seem to not care when a bug happens until a next large update.  Still a great game though!"
Old but gold!
legend/masterpiece dlc is a bit expensive tho
This is one of the greatest real time strategy games ever made. Age of Empires needs to make a comeback and put all these new RTS games to shame. Proud to say I grew up playing the AOE series and it is the franchise that got me into PC gaming.
"After all of these years, it is still an amazing game. I do wish they would do something about thta desync problem."
"Well, what else is there really to say about this classic? It is a well polished game, still played a lot to this day and the HD rerelease includes two completely new subsets of civilizations and campaigns.   I personally got back into a through the youtuber 'Spirit of the Law', whose video about viable strategies helped me rediscover the depths possible."
most amaing game ever period
"Its a 'hd' version of a great game. If you have extra money, buy it. If you dont yet own AoE II, buy it. If you like rts games, buy it. The workshop possibility can really enhance your gaming experience, also new add-ons have been released for this great game."
"A really good game, never gets to old! :)"
this game is a classic i mean you might think that because you played this as a child it might not be fun anymore but you are wrong this game is still one of the best i ever played it inspired all kinds of games for example those annoying adds you see when your playing a free game on your phone lol you will love it i swear dont hesitate and buy this game
"Cant leave it alone! I had the original oh so long ago, but this is timeless. A worthy addition to your library."
"The game is much smoother and fluid then it will ever be in disk format, the audio has been reworked perfectly. This game is a must have for any fan."
"very fun, lots of nostalgia from playing this game"
Age of Empires 2 is the #2 Real-time Strategy game of all time. This is the reboot with HD graphics (few nice little upgrades of graphics and engine with the same playability). Lastability 10/10. Great to play with friends.
"Playing this years ago on cd, fun to pick it up on steam. Lot's of fun playing it again, 10/10."
"  love the game! the online player add on is easier to use, the new civilisations are heaps cool and it is probably one of the best alterations to the original game Age of kings.  Plus it has more campains in it! which are all epic!"
"It may be old but it still is one of the best games I know of. (I do prefer AoE III, but it's close.) I haven't tried multiplayer with the steam version, but being able to save a match and resume it later is great.  I already had the original age of empires II + conquerors expansion, but still bought this during a sale. Having in game music without having to put the cd in the drive is nice and the graphics are slightly better, but I probably wouldn't have bought it when it wasn't on sale."
"AoE 2+ are all great fun games. Nostalgia everywhere. To those who remembered networking these games on LAN or online... The networking is great, no sink errors!  The only real CON...  Please add Age of Empires 1 as well as its Rise of Rome expansion...   It is strange to sell a Legacy/Collection bundle of ALL the AoE games while exluding the first game... You have Age of Empires II and everything after it, but not #1?  My first love will always be the first Age of Empires... I'd buy it in a heartbeat if Steam ever added it."
  Recommended.  
Have not played this game in like 15 years and its still easy to get back into it.
"played this when i was a little kid about 5 years old in 2000s now i can play it again but its nostalgia reasons why its great. let me tell you why this is one of the best rts and why RTS SUCK TODAY.   first off this game unlike most rts clones today is verry indepth and you can actually see the batte of your troops fighting not stupid txt saying 2k troops died XX amount returned etc no none of that lazy crap. here you control and see the combat of your men as the burn the villages etc  you also have to pay attention to food, gold,wood,stone, people cap, etc but unlike (again other crappy rts clones) you actually gotta go and find this stuff not build a house and afk for 8 hours.  heres a bigger reason. this game also is not pay to win either which is a hugeeeeee thing since all rts today are p2w garbage not to mention they all seem to be mobile for some reason. aside from world of warcraft 3 frozen throne this is one of the best rtses of all time and i reall would like to see a new one    AS A LAST NOTE i HIGHLY reccomend this to any rts fan. its almost hard to find a more indepth rts game then this"
Very Classic!
there are multiple ages
"Brings me back to when i was 10. The HD and the mods make it playable and probably the best game im playing right now, is that sad?"
I played this as a kid. Neat to be able to play it again!
This game brings back my childhood. Classic ♥♥♥♥.
"As with many people who grew up with this game, have played it for a massive amount of hours, and loved pretty much all of it. Yes it's dated, but it's good to boot up a classic everynow and then."
I love age of empires series. This is one of my first and now its tied with total war meadival 2 BY SEGA. HOW Could microsoft lose to SEGA. I still love U SEGA! BUT GREAT PURCHASE!!!! let me tell you HD is the way to go. Because it has over 3 differant MEGA CAMPAIGNS and mini campaigns inside that. It also offers map making and mulitplayer AND MUCH more. Now im going to talk about my favorite PART IT allows you to read about the civs you play as so they arent just empty civs. SO if your going to buy it know that its better to wait for a steam sale and get it for 5 dollars. BUT you must know this game takes a long ♥♥♥ time just to beat one of the mini campaigns. So if you are getting it may take 200+ hours just if you want to beat all the campaigns. SO THE FINAL TALLY IS 96%! IT is a great buy but if you are into this RTS gameplay know their is also 3 and mytholgy. But another great series like this is company of heros 2 or 1
"Had over 1,000 hours on this game before steam. When I saw it was on steam I'm like. Holy s***! Instantly bought it. Haven't played it as much as of late but definitely a great game. 10/10 would buy again."
1.Recreating historical battles.  2. Feeling sad when seeing my peasants being killed by a knight.  3. Outstanding graphic mods.  10/10 
multiplayer tends to crash after 30 mins with no possibility to restore cuz the game is just broken AF in this case dont buy if you seek for mp experience  it was easier to play it in 1999  EDIT: all patched
Just as fun as it was when I was a kid. Will keep you busy for hours.
10/10 Discovered this game in the bottom of a Nutri-Grain box and have played it everu since it was on CD-ROM
"It's a classic. If you want to fluid combat and endless power, buy AOE2. You should really only buy if you played it in the past or grew up around that time, otherwise games like starcraft 2 outperform it."
Roses are Red...  WOLOLO!  Roses are Blue...
"Classic RTS, a must have IMO. Back in the day I purchased 4 copies for LAN parties; Steam eliminates the need for all that."
love this game. fifteen thumbs up. :D
"Yes. Age of Empires 2 HD costs £15 for a game that is 15 years old. Now we have that obvious and utterly irrelevant argument out of the way, let me tell you why this game is worth the purchase. You are not paying for the game (well not entirely), you are paying for the ease of use and matchmaking that this new version provides. The multiplayer matchmaking provided by steam for this game breathes life back into the grandfather of many of today's RTS games and (arguably) one of the best LAN games of all time. Whether or not you enjoy the challenge of playing games competively (and by the way - there are people out there who have been playing this game for up to 15 years so do expect to be entirely medicore at first) or you just enjoy the banter and hilarity that inevitably ensues from this game's infinitely replayable co-operative (versus AI) mode, this game caters to any and all of its player base. Simple and easy connectivity, a budding and active community and an overflowing of nostalgia leads this game to be an excellent purchase."
"Played alot of this game years ago, great game"
Better than the original
"I love this RTS game, remember playing it back in 2005 all the time... what sucks is i bought the game for 20 odd bucks and 2 weeks later its only 5 bucks because of summer sale thing"
is gut
Setting ♥♥♥♥ to purpose err day
I loved this game growing up and am so happy it was part of this year's summer sale!
If you like Strategy games  This one is a classic  Totally recommended
Ten outta ten strategy game right here.     - A guy on the Internet.
"A timeless classic from a series of timeless classics that sets the benchmark for every new edition to the genre. Responsibly but no attractively priced but certainly worth keeping an eye out for during steam sales. Certainly invokes a feeling of nostalgia. Definitely a good buy if you are into the genre.  Though I do wish they soon release an original Age of empires for Steam, it was the best game of my childhood.  I pray you soon find a game that is both to your liking, and one you can have fun playing. Take it easy guys"
very cool.
"A fun game to play over the weekend or if you have some time to kill, its getting a bit old, but you visit it every once in a while and the experience is brilliant, veyr nostalgic and just brilliant"
"It's all good aside from the not being able to covert the 'Hero' characters. Kinda ruins most of the missions. Killing them is easy converting them can occasionally put some challenge into it. Plus i'm a collector, i like to have all the hero's."
"Really wonderful game, for news and pros...only go multiplayer if you are a pro tho"
simply a classic!
A classic Real Time Strategy game from the now defunct Ensemble Studios.
This is the best historical strategy game ever made 
"This is the pinnacle of strategy games. I was introduced to this game about 12 years ago. Like most, I first played Wallace's tutorial campaign, and struggled for ~3 hours to beat the Battle of Falkirk. After countless hours of playing (probably about 2,000), and many defeats and victories, I can provide testimony; this game is as good and beautiful as strategy games can get. It has many flaws, but these get quickly overshadowed by its charms. If you're in for hours of planning and execution, battles and economy, war and truce, get this. The expansions are amazing as well. Favorite battles: Vinlandsaga (732 A.D.), The Battle of Tours (1066 A.D.), Barbarossa Campaign and Montezuma Campaign."
"UNTIL THIS GAME IS SOURCE DEDICATED SERVER ENABLED, FORGET ABOUT PLAYING MULTIPLAYER LUDAKRIS maps.   This issue has GOT to be addressed. Peer 2 peer is an absolute pain, and does NOT work correctly!!! There are so many out-of-sync issues with this game that it is a joke. I hear often times too many people say that 'why support such an old game' Yes this game is a relic from the past, but the cult following in pc gaming of AOE II is perhaps even larger than the warcraft series. It is a load of lies when someone tells you a server can't be done, because gamespy DID IT and so did MS gaming zone back in the 90s.   Truth about AOE II from the 90s and the normal game play; It will make you smart, It's proven it will make you smarter! Recent studies have shown that AOE2 does increase your IQ by considerable margins and teaches a person very valuable skills.  Negative note: I loaded this game on an old XP machine (the steam version of it) and surprisingly enough it wouldn't play the game. (4GB of ram, 3.4GHZ intel cpu) this game was made back in the 90s and would play on a computer with 32mb of ram! Steam has to fix this issue, it's a load of bs."
It is user friendly for low experience operators and can be challenging for higher experienced operators with plenty of options.
This game was THE ♥♥♥♥ when i was a kid. Still is. :p
***HELP*** I picked this game up again. However I am playing the Forgotten campaigns and there is no enemy opposition whatsoever. I am specifically referring to Dracula scenario 2. I have difficulty level on Hard and noone ever attacks me. I believe there is issue with latest version if anyone happens to know. The version it says is 4.7.1289507
"Altough AOE II is quite the old game, it has a special place in the hearts of many. You could call it nostalgia, but it is more than that. AOE II has a great gameplay and an even better story. I learned a lot about history from this game.  Pros:  -Nostalgia -Simple yet great gameplay -Great story -Educational in a non boring way -Looks fairly good -Endless posibilities -Create your own map -Nostalgia  Cons:  -Old -Some maps are simply boring and don't seem to be worth playing -'England' -If you choose to play with one map and expand your kingdom, it will get boring after a while"
Definitely a yes for RTS fans 
"Very fun, just like the original."
The game is faithful to the original and steam integration made those massive LAN party battles that much easier. The price is steep at around $20 however is worth the buy on sale for around $5
"Being that I have played this game all my life from the time it was a CD game, I could say a lot about it, but I will only mention a few things. 1: It all started with the first AoE game, best cereal box prize ever! 2: The fact that the game was re-released on Steam about 10 years after the CD version, and new content was added, shows that there is some great quality here. 3: The game seriously has some of the best memes you will ever find. So play the game so they make sense, then spend hours with a couple friends laughing your head off with the 'King of Memes'."
This game is nostalgic. Never though I'd be playing the campaign after so long. I've been having so much fun with the campaign and playing with (or versus) friends is really fun. I recommend playing with friends online!  The new added campaigns are also a really nice addition. With rebindable keys (I recommend to rebind quite a lot of keys seriously if you have played other RTS such as Starcraft) to make it much more easier to control units and production.  Still one of the best RTS. I would only love if the pathing could be updated to be better. I'm still annoyed at units moving incorrectly or formations overwritting my movement / attack orders but that would only be an addition to the game.
Great to play HD version of an old childhood classic. With the workshop mods and support make it better than ever too!
"Amazing RTS, it's an old school, (not fast paced) RTS where you have to manage your economy and army to dominate the oposing force.  And I was NOT converted by an enemy monk."
"Best game ever made. Despite the fact that it is 17 years old or so, it still has simple, straight forward gameplay and no bull feces."
If you are going to play with your friends but don't like them that much then this is the game for you since this game ruins friendships. But anyway have fun
"Best game since '71. I played with my friends Steve and Chris. Unfortunatly, from so much playing, Chirs died after a 24-hour marathon. Now Steve is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"
That game is amazing! Thanks for HD edition.
"  Brings back an all time classic prop. worth every ♥♥♥♥♥ penny.  The online ranked mode was a bit buggy, caused a lot of connection problems, laggs/disconnects Guess u could be get in trouble if u want to 'tryhard' in ranked, but for somebody that just wants to play a classic game with his friends - its 10/10."
"It's a mother♥♥♥♥ing classic. You know you are in front of a good product when there is a vibrant community, competitive play and a thriving and continuous development of a product first released in 1998, 18 years after. No LAN party shall call itself thus and verily if there is no AoE to be had. - Also, you can't say the game doesn't keep up with the times! Not only it now fits 1080p and all the nowadays shenanigans; turtling is no longer a super effective strategy anymore. Do I miss the 90s sometimes."
"For me thats still one of the best game, but i dont really like that i has to pay for new update(African Kingdoms). Game is good btw ;P"
"EDIT: The game, in its current state, is extremely buggy due to recent updates. If you're buying the game for the new content, you're better off waiting. If you don't care much for the new updates, you can downgrade the game to an older version that works. Right now the game (especially multiplayer) is broken.  Nevertheless, this game is definitely one of my favourite multiplayer games."
Don't waste your money on this. It's laggier than playing with 7 BR's on Gameranger and the new lobby system constantly goes out of sync.
"maybe the best game ever, 5/5."
Just wow nostalgia overload
I can't think of any game more deserving of the 'test of time' award
"A cult classic, no other explaination needed"
"I still play this game when I have the time, the aesthetic is pleasing, it's fun building your base and then slaughtering the AI."
Still like the good old times.
I love this game. Recomendo!
"Nostalgia, with better graphics and working online.   ♥♥♥♥ing great game ^^"
Wololo
A Game that you can always come back to after years and years and doesn't get boring. A good game to ease into strategy games.
"It was a tradition in almost my entire family to play this awesome game ♥♥♥♥ing buy it, what are you waiting for? You won't regret it."
"Doesn't matter how old are you, this game will allways be fun to play and a good hobby for any hour."
10/10 Would WOLOLO again.
"Still good, very active community, and more friendly for new players vs. other ways of playing old AoE2 online. Recommended."
"Greatest Strategy game ever made, remastered makes everything more playable"
'A Classic'
Will never forget... wololo. I think this is one of the few games that does not require a review. Played AoE 2? Then buy the HD! You did not? Then this is a must! You don't like RTS? Then a review is useless anyway. A great historical game about history that will never be history!!
F***ing rushers!
It's a meme.
Coolest stuff ever.
Best game of all time. It has withstood the test of time and is still the best game ever.
"An old classic, which doesn't make it any less of a great game. You can choose from a wide range of civilizations, whether you want to play as the Huns or the Scottish, you can make it happen. Multiplayer and Steam Workshop are also available, and the Scenario Editor is a lot of fun to use and share your creations with others to play on."
Best RTS ever :) So many hours was spent on this game and still is being spent :D  10/10
this game is god like played it in my childhood and still love to this day
Still a timeless classic.
Bretty good 5/5. Just don't be a dunce like me and use the patch and the multiplayer works.
"A game that, thanks to the HD update, has been able to stand the test of time. This is a definite buy to anyone who loves RTS!"
"No matter what happens You can have 3 gtx 980 on your pc and you will still make time to play this masterpiece If you played it, buy it If you dont, you better start and build random ♥♥♥♥ through the world"
Best Game to play with friends when you have nothing to do for the next 5 weeks. Brrrraaah. wololol
A classic in the RTS genre that shines even today. A milestone of the genre and a must buy to anyone who likes strategy games
Amazing game! Too bad I beat my friends everytime becus they have only just bought the game... When i play online i either have lagg or i suck and get f*cked by the other players
"A classic timesink of my childhood, and a great RTS with plenty of relatively well balanced options for different play styles. I highly recommend it."
"A flat out amazing RTS game. I played it for years before purchasing the HD version from steam and it was well worth it. While it has its multiplayer issues, it is a fantastic game with lots of content and replayability."
"I would recommend this game if you can get if for a good price. I don't like it that much over the original. Though the AI is better and you get some campaign missions. I didn't like the texture. I expected the texture to be a lot better than what it is now. I get lag when the pop. limit is set to 500. I always play with a pop. limit of 500. I don't know if there is lag at lower limits. The hardware in my gaming rig isn't the issue here. There seems to be some software issue that causes this problem.   After playing for 39 hours I think its worth buying if the price is good, but don't expect too much from this game."
"Now I know where babies come from, Town centres  10/10"
"Great game! This was my first PC game, glad it was put on steam, some small issues with multiplayer, but no dealbreakers."
"Age is a great game,Ive been playing it for years and I recently found it on steam.Best game ever made"
"Age of Empires 2, enough said."
"This game... There is alot to say about it. I bought the original disk copy back in 2000 when I first heard about it, and purchased the conquerors expansion shortly thereafter. I played it for a few years until Age of Empires 3 came out, which was a dissapointment mind you. So when I heard that the HD version came to steam witha new expansion, my entire world stopped.  +five new civs +2 new game modes +LudiKRIS +Same Wololo +/-Server lags if one person's connection is screwy  I recommend this game to anyone who likes spamming wololo and to those who have played this game in the past. GG please re."
"Very nice RTS that is very good at focusing on the macro side of things but also keeps enough micro in to keep you on your toes. I've played this game before it was announced on steam and bought it when it was on sale so I could have the HD features such as online play, supply limit boosted, HD support, etc. Definetly a good classic that if you don't have you should get."
This is probably one of the greatest strategy games i've ever played. You need to think about how you're going to attack your enemies and when. It takes awhile but eventually you'll gather enough resources to dominate your enemies.
"So, you have come to hear the tale of Frederick Barbarossa? This game teaches many things about medieval history, it's a legendary RTS with nice multiplayer community and you can go about some good ol' kebab removing templar style!"
Old but gold :)
This game deserves a classic RTS game award. I played this game long time ago when I was in the diaper.
Pretty Good
"Can't recommend this game enough, a truely timeless game. I lost countless hours to this game in my younger years and still come back for more. A must have for any strategy lover!"
"With all the add-ons and quality of life improvements, this game surely stands the test of time as one of the defining strategy classics."
"Age of Empires 2 is an extremely fun RTS game. In it you can build you Empire from a building and a few units to an immense kingdom stretching from one end of the map to the other. The game is quite simple to learn, and I've always enjoyed playing it. I highly recomend it to any who enjoy RTS games."
"A classic that will never get old, period."
"Classic Game. Play it as a kid and loved it Play it now, still love it! "
"A total classic, stands the test of time and reminds us how good an rts can be"
"This is a great game, and alot of fun to play with friends and family."
Hands down the best RTS Game ever. Countless hours spent playing this is pure bliss. Highly recommended.
  One of the best games of all time.
"This has everything great about aoe2 with better graphics and newer expansions.  What more do you need, huh?   BUY IT !!!!!"
"I grew up playing the original AOE II, and it was AMAZING! This remake is the same, with all the original sounds and music, even the cheats! Raze down your enemies, build an impenetrable empire, or destroy your enemy with blue Shelby Cobras - the choice is yours! This game is awesome and nostalgic."
Great game I used to play loads when I was on my windows 95 pc. Still stands the test of time and is great to play single/multiplayer and the lobbies are populated
Still playing and enjoying this game for more than 10 years. It might have some flows but deserves a special place in my heart.
This is a great upgrade to an already amazing game. Much better graphics and resolution and the steam workshop is has a lot of mods.
has everything from the original but in HD! The real value in this game is the nastalgia. If you loved the original you will enjoy this game. I recomend it if you played the original or if you are an RTS fan.
"This game is amazing, it feels as the first time i've played it. Just a classic of the RTS games that you can't left behind."
"Played the original. Great game.   HD makes it even better. Also, other perks such as extra patches and bug fixes.  9/10 RTS"
Brings me back to childhood. Age of Empires II and all of it's glory is back
"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice game to play, good old nostalgia for some. Strategic action on historical grounds. However, for achievement hunters this game is a nightmare.  * There are 250 achievements, and most of the achievements require a specific number of specific things, the greatest number usually being 500 or 1000. Imagine taking part in 1000 multiplayer sessions. How about single player sessions? How about suffering casualties, destroying buildings, creating buildings... How about winning one, five or fifty matches with EVERY RACE in the game?! How about.. egh, you get the image. *  What's worse, every achievement has a sh*tload of text, usually spanning across the overlay or steam's own window, occasionally and effectively rendering the achievement's actual goal unreadable. For example, read that text that's between those stars. That's Achievement Text Simulator 2015 for you :D  "
Best game from my childhood. Even though it takes up a crap load amount of time it is still very fun to play 10/10 playing it again :D
Nice game.
bad ♥♥♥ old school ♥♥♥♥
"Since the game is now patched, I honestly think the game has surpassed expectations. As challenging and fun as ever, AoE II is still one of my favorite strategy games of all time, and for good reason.   4.9/5 stars given that there are actually achievements for winning 1000 (yes...one thousand) battles with each civilization. I could put hundreds of hours into this game and be lucky if I came out with one of those. I plan to put plenty of hours, but hundreds with EACH CIV? No."
"Very fun game. I used to love playing this back in the day. However, the frame rate drops to an unplayable level when there are thousands of units -- overall, mixed feelings about this. Maybe if the frame rate issue is fixed, then I would be able to give this game a better review."
The 1st ever game I played on Pc. Such a good game. Loved it so much that i brought the HD edition. Still one of the games i enjoy playing most. 10/10 - best stratergy game I have ever played. 'has that unique feeling to it. Fully reccomend this game.
"Solid remake(-ish) for release on Steam. The DLC and workshop incorporation are amazing features that boost the quality of this already amazing game. I've spent countless hours on this title pre-Steam, and I plan to do so again. Great game, tons of fun, and definitely worth having."
"A well-done remake of a classic game; one that I remember fondly from my childhood. The best part about this game is the community surrounding it, with active participation from the developers. There are constant updates being released, including a new AI that was introduced not long before I wrote this. For what the game costs, it's absolutely worth a try."
"Achievement Hunters BEWARE: Do not buy!  While this game was and is fun, I have started to hate it on steam, because:   there is one unlockable achievement, unless you pre-ordered it. For all the others, like me, the developers thought it would be a good idea to give as a big middle fingers.   for each race, you have to win 1000 battles. I started to hate this really fast. Sure, there is a workaround and you can simply reload the last seconds of one battle 100 times to get it. But this still takes about 9 boring hours. I am, however obsessed enough to do it.   On the plus side:   Bash a sword into a castle made out of rock, and fire comes out!!! 10/10  On the funny side: Played a standard game the other day: Byzantines vs Korean&amp;chinese Achievements Unlocked: Champion of the Mongols!! Enemy of the Japanese!!  In total, I would not get this game on steam, simply because you cannot perfect it. Now I have it, and there is nothing else that I can do about it, but I highly don't recommend it to achievement hunters.  "
crazy fun skirmishes and campaign. plus information about ancient civilizations
I've only cared for the multiplayer. It's fine. It's fast. It's challenging. It's micromanaging at a good level.
"This game came out in 1999, but it's still the best strategy game ever! 10/10"
"I first played this game when I was 6. I'm 23 now, and still love it.  Fun to play, even if you suck at it with your friends or against the AI. Or if you want a challenge, playing online against other people is good for that too. There really is something for everyone in this game and I have never met anyone who has not liked playing it."
Not sure why HD but good
Greatest RTS ever!
"An old and fun RTS which has been updated so you can continue to build a civilisation that will stand the test of time.  + Updated, challenging AI. + Supports modern screen resolutions. + Balance updates. On an eight year old game. + Interesting campaigns that get challenging for new players quickly. + Expansion packs with beautiful and interesting content: civilisations, maps, campaigns. - Around 10% of multiplayer games crash in the current iteration. Restoring from backups often doesn't work. - The first five to ten minutes of a match can get a bit same-y, with a fixed build order for optimal play.  You should know that there is a different version of this game on Voobly. It has better netcode (multiplayer less likely to crash), but no updated AI, balance updates, or new campaigns, as far as I know. If you just want to play tryhard multiplayer, that version is recommended."
This game is still as fun today as it was many years ago when i first played it.
A little buggy but very playable and much improved over the original
One of the best strategy game!
Would Wololoo again
One of the best games I have ever played
"Loved this game as a child, still love it know.  One of the best Strategy games I have ever played"
Have played this game fr years and it somehow never get old :)
Just play this mother♥♥♥♥ing game already. If you haven't youre about 17 years late to the party.
"Been playing this since 2003, not stopped yet.  The HD is an icing on the cake"
This Game will forever stand the test of time. Truly the one of the best RTS games and my fav.
"Awful, maybe a 1/10 and that's only because I'm still on a sugar high from Easter.  Bad things: Units don't auto-heal except for one unit. You can't call in tactical strikes. You have to collect resources. You have to build silly things like houses and mills. You have no tanks or planes or anything. Just horses and camels and even elephants lol. No African civilisations so obviously there is a bit of racism involved. The Teutons who are basically Germans are massively overpowered so I'm guessing Nazis were involved in the making of this game. Lame music.  Good things: It's easy to exit. "
"Just like old times, with improved graphics :)"
"Nostaligic isnt quite the right word. This was my first computer game. Played on a windows 98 laptop. It will always hold special place in my heart. So that means when i write this review it may be through rose tinted glasses. The graphics are classic but slightly updated meaning its still as appealing for the eye but lack of zoom means you cant get in on the action. Other than that you can tell its an old game, the scottish accent in the tutorial campaign and i didnt progress to the joan of arc but i imagine its not quite french =). the gameplay feels slow and laboured but once you have the balance of production to useage your flying. I think todays generation wont understand this game. I think they will look at it and say why woould you play that when there is Civ 5 or Rome 2, Heck there is a less publicised 3rd installment (which i loved). But i think For all those over a certain age will be brought back to days past when time was spent building wooden walls and upgrading them stone and wondering why there are monks and universities. In all I plan to have loads of fun with this and my mates (bought the 4 pack edition)."
"Great game, spend hours on this!"
"The nostalgia of this game for me is unlimited. I grew up playing AoE and AoE-2. To be able to play this game again and still enjoy it as much now as I did then, is very awesome for me. It's one of the few games I have where I can relax and not have to think too heavily about what I'm doing. Love it!"
"One of my favorite RTS's out there, although they have a bit of technical issues on the online front, which can be annoying. Otherwise is a great game!"
Because new games are terrrrrrible.
"Exact same as the old one, just looks better and has workshop integration."
Still the best.
"This game is, in some ways, what define any gamer born in the 90'.  A must have, must play, must love.  Obviously, a fair winner of the Steam Award 'Test of Time'"
The Best Rts of the last 20~ years.
Great Mongol United = GMU
Never get older.. There's no to say... Respect.
"Even if you never had the opportunity to play this classical game when it was first released and therefore have nostalgia for it, I still think that if you can see beyond the slightly old graphics and pathfinding problems that this game occasionally has, that you would really enjoy it.  Take the chance to play as a historical civilization such as the Mayans, Britons, Spaniards and so on. and make sure that their glorious legacy lives forever on.  The HD makeover just adds to the experience, with improvements throughout the game, I'd say that it was a well made HD-remake, not one of the more 'Cash-Grabby' ones which do appear from time to time. Even though you could still claim that the graphics look 'dated' I just think that it adds to the experience and wouldn't want it any other way.   The campaigns alone would make this game worth purchasing in my opion, but if you have a couple of friends to play this game online with, then this game will bring you hours upon hours of entertainment and you'll be talking about you mighty victories and shameful plays... for days/weeks maybe even months after they happened.  So, if you like strategy games and can look beyond the slightly dated graphics and somethings wonky pathfinding. Then you have yourself a really nice game here, a gem from days yonder that will never come again and well worth your consideration.  The expansions are in no way required, unless you want some more campaigns to put your teeth into and a few more civilizations from online play, but never fear, there are random civilizations that are available to play online every week, so you get a chance to experience the civilizations in the campaigns, even if you don't own the expansions.  Please consider it as your next bout into a strategy game. You won't regret it."
I spent most of my childhood playing this game. What more do I have to say?
Timeless classic. Best RTS I've ever played.
"I have the old, non-HD version and I enjoyed it very much. The graphics of the new expansions look weird though, and I don't enjoy the new campaigns."
"The game that never dies, everyone plays it everyone loves it."
"First game I played, still one of the best"
This is by far one of the greatest games ever created. 10/10 Will always enjoy!!
Still the best RTS multiplayer   10/10
Takes your time. All-Time classic. Winning against your friends never gets old.  Don't think you need to know more.  Buy it as a package. Single DLC's are way overpriced.
Just a Great REWORK of a masterpiece
--
Definitely the best game ever made.
Killed elephant with a machinegun-toting AC Cobra.   10/10 Would play again.
"Ahhhhh yes, this is the game of my high schooling years. a very nice RTS War game'Teutons for ever'. Much in the vain of Warcraft, starcraft and other of the kind the HD remake cleans up the Graphics ( makes the water look nicer). the game play has not change but you can speed it up now a bit more then it use to make the ones slooooooooooow infantry much more bearable in speeds. with a 4 resorces to manage 11 tribes to play as ( and two expansions give you 10 more 'empires') each with a special unit or two and slightly different architecture on their buildings and with minor variants on the standard troops and Expansove tech trees. this is a great game for Lan partys ( did that a lot as a Teen) the variety of troops tactics and historical unique troops to aid you this game is meant to be played with more than 2 players, the campaign is not as strong as it could be but who plays AoE for the single player. This is a great game."
Just like the Old Times... Perfect with this new features. Not that many things but that 5 euros worth it as much!
It's Age of Empires 2!
"Great game, while not too dissimilar from other RTS in terms of gameplay. The variety of civilizations, game modes, maps and playstyles that this game provides makes it an instant classic. Whilst the graphics are not up to pay by even today's lower tier computers, no other civilization RTS has comes close. 8/10."
"This game is the game i base all rts games on. It is exactly like the old one, but with more gameplay, better graphics, and a community to back it. I definitely recommend!"
One of the most beloved RTS games of my generation. Defiantly pick this up
Still as good as when it was released :) JUST UPDATED GRAPHICS AND MULTIPLAYER
Still the best!
To keep this brief... This is one of the best games ever made. Enough said.
Well it is a legend and still great game to play :)
this game is a good game
"Originally coming out on September 30, 1999, this game was a massive hit. I still think it is. I'm nominating it for the Stand of Time award."
"Absolutely classic game, played this for countless hours growing up. Will always find a way to return to it, especially with the visual upgrade."
Best RTS of all times!
"I've played this game for around 14 years now. Still my favorite game of all time, still fun."
"It's so gud! Buy it, play it forever!"
"This game is highly addictive, easy to play, and so much fun both online and offline. highly recommened"
An amazing medival startegy game. Played since the disc release and decided to pick it up on steam for some nostalgia.  Most prefered playing with family and friends.  WARNING-When playing online multiplayer beware of try-hards who have tirelessly put their whole life into mastering the game so that no one can beat them (just saying).
"Still a classic. I've worn through dozens of other RTS games, including the rest of the AoE series, but it's AoE II that I keep coming back to every year for 10 years. Still fun, still beautiful, still engaging. I can't recommend this game enough."
Good memories from the CD-ROM days. Good goooood memories
"Such a great game to play with friends. It's a bit of a challenge and has a tiny learning curve but it's just such a timeless game. If you are wondering if you should get it, do, and get your friends to as well."
Help! how do stop wolves from attacking my villagers?  9/10
"LOVE THE GAME, I HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS. I HAD IT SINCE THE FIRST AOE, MY SON LOVES IT ALSO PLAYS IT TILL THIS DAY. WE ARE FANS FOR LIFE!!!!!!"
An amazing classic. What else can I say. Just buy it.
Build Civilization. Gets Destroyed. 2+ hours Gone. Repeat.
"Still one of the best RTS out there. If you look for a not so fast RTS and have a few Childhood Memories with AoE2 then buy this game, go back in time for yourself and have a lot of fun!"
"After all these years, still the best RTS game around!"
"Still one of the most epic games in history. Its a must have, stop reading this, buy the game and enjoy nostalgia!"
A game with trebuchets can't be bad at all.
"Age of Empire 2 was created in 1999 and yet people are playing it. And I definetly see why. Nostalgia obviously plays a small here but for what is worth, it's a really great game to play. You pick a civilisation, produce soldiers, maintain farming, mining, and finaly Kill your enemies.   The thing I always liked about the games I play is the options how to play. And yes almost all the factions/civilisations do have all the same kind of start, but bonuses and unique soldiers will give you the push you need to succeed. Like some are based on infantry, cavalrie etc.   In short: if you have played the old one in 1999? Buy this game and have fun.  And if you have never played any of the Age of Emipire before? then a good tutoriel will always get you on the right path and have fun."
"I was a big fan of this game and i am still am. Now that i am mature enought not to spam my car cheat, i can finally play the real game :D 11/10 would remember the old days again.If you have any questions how I gave any rating feel free to comment. Please keep in mind that this is my personal preferences:  Story: 8 (the single player is acctually pretty fun)  Gameplay: 8 (more companies should take an example of this masterpiece when making strategy games)  Voice Acting/Music: 10 xD  Graphics:6 (well... even it says HD i cant see it that much, but the graphics goes with the concept which is what is important)  Depth: n/a  Flexibility: 8 (it is a well developped strategy game)  Reward System: 8 (the difficulty levels are very well made which makes winning a game much more rewarding)  Community: 8 (i was acctually suprised that this game has a community still, and also it is a good and sincere one)  Total: 8/10"
A truly remarkable game.
10/10 would wololo again
"After all these years, still have the bug for this game xD ♥♥♥  10/10 ☺"
Awesome that they brought this game back to newer pc's.  Total nostalgia !! Most invigorating !!
a very good game.
"Played it in 1999, playing it today. One of the diamonds in strategy game history!"
AoE 2 was the first game i remember playing. Best rts imo.
this is OG man
You must have this game no matter what.
"Strategic perfection, now in HD."
"This was a 'time killer' 15 years ago and for me it's still the same. No time to sleep, still need to destroy one more enemy... :)"
After so many years I still hold this game close to my heart.
Very good game.This game its a masterpice.
Probably on of my all time favorites. I remember playing this when i was in school with all my friends nearly 10 years ago. Still one of the best RTS games and the HD remake is fantastic.
"Just played a five hour session with one of my friends, it was rediculous"
"Still a good game. It's however not really HD. I think it runs at 720p and widescreen, which is a step up from the original. I also have a problem with the sound that every time I tab out of the game and then enters it again it resets the volume in windows to half of the system max volume. Which is a problem since the game is rather loud."
"It's really upsetting that there is no lan support, which was avaiable in the original game."
"Wonderful game, very good memories stem from it. For those uninitiated with the franchise, it is a fast paced RTS with a focus on advancing 'ages,' in order to perfect technologies and ultimately conquer the map. The AI have been updated in the HD edition, so it really is a consistent challenge. I've lost so many games on here, its laughable. What keeps it interesting to me is the huge variety of strategies available to win. There are also many different enviornments. Deserts, Islands, Forrests, etc. The community is also still active, with many active site forums discussing strategies and fun game moments. I'm addicted, and i'm not even very good. I'd recomend this to almost anyone."
Age of Empires is a great game. That requires skill and strategy&gt;
"This game has the dubious honour of beating out many terribly ported games to be one of the worst ports I've ever played. However, it also possesses the far less dubious honour of being one of the finest RTS games ever designed, whose original version sadly no longer works on modern versions of windows. It's on sale semi-regularly, so i'd advocate picking it up then."
"good game, aint played it since i was a kid... fuun times"
Multiplayer is so fun when playing with friends. Singleplayer also ensures plenty of gametime. Old game so graphics aren't brill but otherwise great game. 9.5/10 would reccomend
"A real game from the era when strategy games were still fun, simple, intelligent and complex at the same time without any one compromising the other."
This is without any doubt the best HD 'remake' ever done.  The game has been truly updated and renewed and after years the game is still being patched actively.
"The greatest RTS there will ever be, nothing but an Age of Empires IV will change that."
"This game is just pure fun. You can rage, laugh and cry at the same time.  10/10 Would steal sheep with the celts again"
"Spent my childhood playing AoE II, it got me into gaming, so I bought it again and enjoy it as much as before. A great classic, so I nominated it for the 'Test of Time' award."
"Classic, plain and simple!"
"Childhood memories, GG."
"over many years, this is still a good game"
Definitly the best RTS of all time. 10/10
I find this game still to be very good and addicting. Great fun with friends and very satisfying even alone.
i have a dream that one day this game will be remastered not like age of mythology
"Still old, still gold... now with steam support??!?!?!?!"
"I nominated this game for 'The test of time' award ... and for what I think is a good reason, as I am sure this game, the same as a Wonder, it has and will stand the test of time.   One of the best strategy games I know to date, and father of RTS games, it is no surprise that so many people still apreciate it even now.   If there is a strategy player out there who hasn't played this game yet, I highy recomend it ... but I doubt there is ..."
"This game taught me that no matter what I do, those AIs always steal my sheep!"
Can't even devise a strategy good enough to beat the AI on easy  10/10
I have always loved this game and the franchise in general. It was always mt preference over the Warcraft franchise.
:)
Still one of the best strategy game of all time. Would love to see Age of Empire with new engine and new mechanics.
"Same old swordclash we spent hours on 15 years ago. Some new civs, some new units and bonuses, can't say if the AI is worse or I got better, but still fun. Thumbs up!"
Best strategy game.
Still as good as it ever was.
Best old school RTS
"Old but gold, started learning how to actually play recently, new bots certainly give a challenge. 1v2 against bots seems like fairly good practice."
"A true classic of the RTS genre, timeless!"
"Still one of the best RTS after its release. It's fun even if you don't win, friends make it worth it. :) 10/10"
"Was a great game back in the day, is still a great game today."
1000 to 2000 hours played when I was younger..  This is an classic game! 
I used nothing but horses and cars to destroy the world. 10/10
awesome really addicting but you get sick of it after 20 hours of playing
My hours can't tell how much I still appreciate this game. They can't because of my lack of time to play it. I would play 24/7 if I could. I just can't get enough.
This game is the true Original Gangster!
"The Classic, but in HD. Having logged hundreds of hours into the original, this is everything I dreamed it would be. If you loved the original, or are a fan of RTS games, you won't be disappointed. Goes on sale a lot, too."
"First game I ever played on PC, in 2004. still playing it more than a decade later. That should speak for itself."
"As much as I would love to recommend this game, I can't. Despite the nostalgia I get from playing this after being away from it for almost ten years, the lag you'll experience during multiplayer is unbearable, this even happens when you are in Friend-only matches. But i suppose I should add something positive to this review so here goes: -Great gameplay with a good amount of game modes to choose from. -The soundtrack is as good as ever.  Unless somebody finds a way to fix the lag, don't get it for the multiplayer. You're better of finding a copy of the old version and then play with your friends on that instead."
"If you aren´t the type of guy who plays strategic games, you can start with this beauty, it is easy to play and insanely adictive. Plus, you learn some history while your are playing."
One of the best strategy games of all time
It's addicting as hell
"HD or not, this game is a classic and needs to be played by any RTS fan, arguably one of the originals."
"Grew up with this game, still suck at it though. But it doesn't matter, I can still play it to this day!"
"As good as old times, same problems of old times. Avoid MP."
This game stood the test of time. One of the best RTS of all time. And it still gets updates.
"Age of Empires II, released in 1999 and still surviving to 2016 with new content, how does a game so old survive over 15 years and yet still maintain interest? This is one such game.  Age of Empires II HD gives new life combining old and new, the graphics are decidedly outdated but still maintain a sense of luster that doesnt turn you away, but rather endears you to what games used to be like. They gave them new life.  The gameplay is indepth, random, and the AI can be absolutely brutal if you want a challenge or want it easy, dont like playing with people, enjoy the multitutde of story based missions and campaigns that span multiple historical eras.  The story is well written, fairly accurate, if you can call a lone villager building an entire town spanning several hundred years and still happy to keep serving it's oppressive overlord accurate. You'll enjoy the voiced over characters, the story of taking men and women from the birth of their career to the very height such as Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Atilla the Hun, the list is fairly extensive between this game and the dlc's.  It is a game worth buying for new players or reminding old players of what it truly meant to play an RTS game that has class, charm, and still some of the strongest AI I've ever encountered.  10/10"
"One of the best old school games regardless to the nostalgia it brings, HD my ♥♥♥♥ though, it looks the exact same."
if any one wants to play mp with me i m here great game
"Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ wont work. Multiplayer lags like hell. They wont fix it. Pls microsoft, dont puplish this ♥♥♥♥ with HD label and take 20€from a game that doesnt work. peec"
This is AoE 2 as you remember it. Amazing!
Excellent game! Used to play this one when i was little! Its exactly how i remembered!
An old classic I used to play and still love.
This game is king.  Get it.  10/10 Lemons.
Good old game.
I am happy games like this are still here and people still play them. This is what games should be. Developers take note.
It's Age of Empires.  buy it.
Nothing can beat AoE1 but still alot of fun :D
i love these games  
This game has always been a favorite of mine. Greatly enjoyable and lots of fun. Would recommend to anyone who likes historically-based games.
Nestalgia will get this game a lot of good reviews but in reality it deserves it's reputation as an RTS that has aged spectacularly well.
A true RTS classic!
"The best part is being able to play matched with some frieds, whether it's against each other or teamed up against bots you are always infor a good time. I love this game and whether you choose to play solo and go through campaigns, or play multiplayer you are in for hours of challenging strategy filled fun! My firends and I have been having AoE parties for years, and probably will for years to come."
HECK YEA AWESOME STRATEGIES
"I personally liked this one better than the III because I felt it was more and fun as a strategy game. I feel the number III just has better graphics and more variety. Now with this made HD We can finally get that classic , retro feeling without worrying about graphics. Truly great . Im a fan of the series and I awaited this for long . It was worth every penny. 8/10"
Played this game as a kid and it has always been an alltime favorite!
"I love this game so much, I used to play this game on the PS2 which was AoE: Age of Kings and that was buggy but I still loved it :D I give a big thanks to the developers of this game for making it incredibly entertaining and just darn right awesome.  I would give this game an 8/10 just because it meets all my standards that I want in a game. I would deffinetly reccomend this to anyone!"
i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME BUT RECENTLY GOT A MAC AND IT WONT LET ME PLAY ANYMORE :(
"feels kinda like civilization,total war and its own little genre.9.5 out of 10.its worth 20 bucks.but if you can get it on sale like i did,go for it"
"Great game, played it on its original release and still pleased that it has held up the test of time."
"This HD remake is very, very good, i totally recommend it. Just bought it from the Midweek discount. It have the same campaigns, everything just in HD, better shadows, 3D water, characters and building a lot more detailed. It is the same Age of Kings and The Conquerors. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty awesome, i'm loving it, although it is the same old game (storyline and gameplay speaking), it feels like a new game with all the graphics renovations. This is the perfect remake for those who love the original AoE and wanna remember good old times, with a little more of flavor, as i am one of those, i give it 10/10"
its age of empirs in the HD!
this is the woast site ever
"lets cut to the chase. It is age of empires 2, if you have played it before you know how great it is, and if you have never played it before GREAT, now is you have the chance to play one of the best RTSs there is. your welcome"
Though my steam account may not show it I have easily put 100+ hours into this game and I loved every second of it. Somehow you can play match after match of this game and never get bored of it. There is no rts I could recommend higher than this.
404 insufficent micro
"This game re-captures the fun and game-play of the classic AOE2. I've generally enjoyed it more than the later games in the AOE franchise, and it's good to see the game with updated resolution for more recent hardware.  I own a boxed copy of AOE2 Gold Edition (which includes the Conquerors expansion pack), but I went ahead and bought this updated version anyway for the better graphics capabilty. I was quite happy also when the developers pushed out a whole new expansion pack (The Forgotten) for this game.   After receiving news of the demise of AOE Online, I was a bit disappointed. But AOE2 HD (and The Forgotten expansion pack / DLC) have put me back in a good mood for conquering the world.  Update: The African Kingdoms expansion has also been pretty good. After all these years, this is still one of my favorite games to play."
"An all-time classic, the best strategy game ever made, PERIOD. And the Steam updates are fancy, too. I recommend the Portuguese!"
'best use of a farm animals'  literalmente
"The best RTS from the late nineties/early two thousands period. More complicated and more beautiful games have come since AoEII orignial release, but the simplistic aspect to the gameplay allows for a satisfying loop of building up and conquering."
will never get old its timeless
I only recommend this to people who loved Age of Empires 2. It's exactly the same game. Pass on this if you never played it before or if you're a hardcore RTS fan (which you've probably played this if you are.)
Great Game period.
"Great LAN game for up to 8 friends.  Campaign is dated sadly, but still a fantastic game.  Visuals are nicely ramped up since last release.   Worth it? Yes, only if you intend to play with friends lanning/online however. Otherwise the game is about 10 years too old to be bought just for solo play."
awesome game :D love it
"Some issues with Multiplayer lag, but then again I am in Malaysia. A faithful maintenance update of one of my favourite games of all time, this (sort of) teaches you history while making you swear at little sprites for not riding their horses fast enough, or laugh manically as your unique unit slaughters poor defenceless... ok I'd better stop. Wouldn't want to give my tactics away!"
Classic.
"My friends love this game, but I am terrible at it. However it is still fun trying to play this game. Worth the purchase!"
"I Love this game, I was brought up on this game and now I have the chance to play it again on a modern machine, worth all the monies in the world!"
"Reminds me of the good old days. This is pretty much the same game as the original (Which is a good thing), but the multiplayer actually works!"
Classic game remastered. Cant say anything bad about it
"It's the AoE experience that you know in love with some updates and tweaks, along with mod support. If you love AoE, you MUST have this in your collection."
Teutonic knights are best knights.
Awesome classic strategy game. Highly reccomend it.
"This is an amazing game and has stood the test of time, outclassing it's own successor. Since I bought this in 1999 (I think), I keep coming back to it, despite pulls from subsequent releases (AOE 3, C&amp;C x tons, etc).  The graphics are a little dated and the HD version really doesn't add much to the experience but there is so much to do and achieve that I still think I'll be playing it in 40-50 years (it'll definitely outlive me)!"
"It's purely old days, you will love this if you spend time at the old good AoE games. Online is crowded aswell..."
Great game that I haven't played since I was like ten..
A HD remake for the old AOE 2 so you know it's going to be amazing
Are there better RTS's out there? Probably.  Are there RTS's out there with more nostalgia? No!
Nothing beats a decade old tradition of fighting back Aztec monks with Welsh bamboo.
"I have always loved this game, ever since I was 4 years old. Im very glad that they remastered it and gave life to this amazing game. I reccomend it to anyone who loves history and strategy games!"
Real time strategizing like it's 1999! So many good memories brought right back to life.
Still one of the most active and best of the classic 1990's/early 2000's RTS games.
"I always somehow gravitate back to this game when I'm in the mood for a good RTS. When it's on sale, I buy it for friends who I want to game with and they always end up begging ME to play with them!"
"This game is great, I have a lot of fun playing either alone or with/against my friends. I played the original for hundreds of hours back when it came out and I can see myself doing the same with this version. Can't really go wrong picking this game if you like the RTS genre."
"This is the best way to play one of the best RTS ever. They are still doing constant update, which is crazy to think when the game is more than 10 years old!"
Grew up playing this game. Bought it as soon as I was financially able. I still enjoy it to this day. Recommended over 9000!!
"Laaaging like hell, I purchased two copies of this game for me and my bro, both of us are having the same issue, both in singleplayer and multiplayer. I love this game so much...but this lag is ruining it... :-("
Classic!! AoE never gets old.
"This game holds it's own, a medieval Command and Conquer, sure there are better graphics available these days, but I still enjoy playing this today."
"It's finally fixed and thanks to SteamWorks, you can mod this puppy to look a lot more pretty."
"I loved AOE II in my youth and was looking forward to playing it again with some better res.  Don't bother buying this version, all they did is port the thing to some new OS and basicly added some resolutions, the rest is still just as the old version. Might as well play that one."
"Still feels like the original, even suffers from that beautiful waiting to continue bug in the online :D"
very very classic game for the post-90s   that reminds me of my childhood
Pls make Age of Empire I! Best review would read again 10/10!
"Love the nostalgia of AoE just brings back memories, i would reccomend to people who played this game when it came out, and for new people, once you learn the basics, it just keeps getting better."
Classics never get old
Can't wait for the sequel!   /s
Playing this is High School is why i do construction for a living now. :( How the Mighty have fallen...
"It's a timeless, classic game :')"
  it's alright
"oh god, the crash"
does it still need a review?
skyrim with guns
Great game
"So many hours playing this game as a kid. I am so glad to have it back, and in 1080p NO LESS!"
"First of all Add me as a friend: Remy7_7  I think that this game has to be one of the best games in the world.  I played this game when i was a kid about 7 years old (14 years old now), this is the game that made me play many other games and the first game i played on an electronic device.  It all started when i was a kid with a very boring life, and then all of a sudden my uncle gets this game with a pc for me on christmas. I have never experienced a game better than this before. I do not like 2D games that much but this game is exceptional. After we had to move to another country, i lost my pc including the game. Throughout the years i have been searching for this game everywhere. I have finally found this game and never felt happier. I played this game about 9 hours a day (this is the first day).   It may look stupid and boring, but once you buy it and play. YOU WILL NOT STOP!!!!!  I love this game, it brings back many memories.  Games that bring back memories and are top on my list: Age of Empires, Call of Duty Black ops 2, Tomb Raider, Army of Zin.  I reccomend this game because i know that everyone would love it!!"
This is a great game for anyone who loves strategy games. I played it back when it came out and i play it now. This game defines what a true RTS should be like in my opinion.
Classic game that still holds up extremely well today. Get it if you haven't already.
One of the first games that I have ever played and it is still fun to play. One of the best strategy games to date.
The memory is back.
"An incredible classic, this game truly stands the test of time."
This is my 'Test of Time' nomination.  Being over 17 years old now this game still gaining expantions to add on to the massive amounts of content that already exists. The game truly has stood the test of time and will hopfully continue it's life span for years to come.
Old is Gold
"Still one of the best RTS games out there, wasted many computer classes on the original"
"This is a great game, played it lots with cousins and freinds when i was young. Then it came out on steam and we all had to buy it. this game will never get old, we will always come back to it and the only con for this game is it is a bit buggy and needs some small fixes. Your people stop moving for no reason."
This really is a great game!
"I remember playing this game when I was 12 years old, and the gameplay still holds up 13 years later. If you've never played this game, do yourself a favor and purchase it. Whether you are an RTS fan or maybe new into the genre, Age of Empire II is a fantastic game that has been made even better by the reboot, the expansions, and its workshop."
Start the game already!
"Still to this day, my favorite RTS game of all time."
"This game is definetly not for everyone and games can take a very long time but if you like rts games, then I highly suggest AOE:2"
I used to play this game as a kid and now I play it competively online. Such a fun game! The mins fly by!
"Voted most likely to have played during childhood!  Still holds up to this day as a great game especially with friends in a Game of thrones style diplomacy, the dlc is nice but I think the base game is fine.   Havn't really played much Mulitplayer but the few people I've played with are friendly and make multiplayer enjoyable."
I nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' award.  Can you think of a game that is more timeless than this one? I certainly can't.
"Good old AOE 2, play alot in childhood, play 42 hr in HD version. Still good playing even as of now. Very good RTS, there are some really well made guide on youtube. One of the best communities I think."
An awesome classic
Best game of all time.
"Honestly, this game has not lost any of the initial appeal it had when it released in 1999. Granted, I wasn't quite old enough to understand how to combat wave after wave of Aztec monks converting my town to heretical faiths, nor could I mster the 1000 gold neccesary to research religious seppuku, but that's besides the point. The basic game that released is hailed as one of the greatest RTS's of all time, and when the shiny new HD version was dropped, I for one snapped it up quicker than a herd of goats or a relic.   The HD version, and realistically the only version available, unless you're booting on 2000, XP, or god forbid, Vista, and man, oh man, is it worth every penny. It's got every positive feauture of the basic game that dropped back in the 20th centuy, and a whole lot more. Arguably, the single largest addition is within the title, held in two beautiful capital letters, HD. The HD reboot makes the game look so much better to both the rookie and the veteran, without removing the appeal the game's semi-pixelated, lowly detailed base provided.   The graphical overhaul that this game provides is one of many upgrades and additions, all of which make the game so much fun to play alone, or with your friends. The big berthas among these are a strong standout, large variation of customization in terms of both single and multiplayer, as well as the options within the map editor, all of which can be tinkered with to create a limitless series of games, scenarios, and other fun shenanigans.   Overall, the game is wonderful, and has a lot of potential to continue growing in terms of workshop and DLC, and is worth a buy at full price or on sale. Just buy the game, you know you want to."
I nominate this game for the 'Best Use of a Farm Animal' award because nothing beats exploring thhe map with sheep.
This was the first PC game I ever played. Here I am 17 years later still playing it....
"Quality timeless game, have been playing ever since it first came out!"
It is an excellent RTS with a good learning curve.
Possibly the best RTS ever made.
Still great after all these years.
"This game will live through a millenia heh, best RTS :D"
"Other newer games might have better balance or AI or graphic, but ther original version of this game is in immortal my heart for one thing. It taught me about RTS. It's amazing how intuitive and easily understood this game is. I played other RTS before this, but this is the one that taught me RTS is fun."
Very happy this was picked up again and that new content keeps being made.   A timeless classic that's always a joy to play!
Still to this day one of the best RTS games every made. Where else can you have a six way battle royale between cultures from all over the world.
"A classic game. Great game where problem solving skills comes to use. Perfect game for times when you dont have internet, otherwise, playing against or with friend online is hella fun.   Wolololol"
21  29  30  11 11 11
Thia game is never get old.
I played only this literally for a year (the non-HD version) Best RTS
"This is truly a game for the ages. There are so many other RTS games and even several more in this series, but it always comes back to Age of Empires 2. The gameplay is excellent, the civilizations are similar enough to make them familiar, but JUST different enough for some strategy. It provides both multiplayer and casual fun with smashing armies into computers in single player."
The age old classic game is back! I used to play hours and hours of this game when i was little and i am massively gratefull to Hidden Entertainement for giving it a small graphical boost and bringing it back to be playable on todays computers because a game like this should not be forgotten! Hands down one of the best strategic war games of the century!
Stands the test of time and relives countless hours of fun I had years ago. Totally recommend it.
One of the best strategy games ever made! When AOE2 came I spent countless hours with this fantastic game. Now HD remake is out which is basically the same old AOE shwoing how marvelous the game desgin was that still it is one of the best RTS games one can find.
This game is still a great game (don't mind my hours on steam). I played this game so much back in the day and love it. Saw it on steam and got some friends to get it as well and it still reminds me of the old days. This version is not without its faults like there is a little bit of latency in between what you want to happen to when it does happen but later on in the game you tend to forget about it as you are focusing on a lot of things.
One of the best RTS around. Never gets old
I want that badge
I cannot believe that was able to play it with friends and with almost no lag and drops at all as the old version had so issues in this aspect. It is good to see a cult classic again and working flawlessly on a modern PC.
Still as good as the first day I played it 13 years ago.
The use of farm animals in this game is something that I find inspiring.
"This game is as great as it was when I bought it on release day! Even better, even because it includes new content and is optimized for newer systems"
Perfect
"Nothing new, but as good as the original."
As soon as I launched the game memories from over 10 years ago came rushing back. I loved this game and still love it. Thank you for bringing it back.
"Other than the weird multiplayer lag I still have not been able to fix, this game is awesome, and totally worth buying."
"Just as awesome as I remember it, still the best strategy game I have ever played, nice to have the updated resolution and graphics, and the new campaigns are just as fun as the old, aside from the missing voice overs."
One of the best RTS games out there. Great to play with friends. 10/10
Best medival production-RTS ever.
This game is one of those games I'd play for days on end back when I was smaller and now with its more functional Multiplayer it adds to the fun. Get the 4-pack and split it with friends and you have 100s of hours of fun waiting for you.
Same great game with slightly improved fire and water effects and multiplayer works much better than before. Not so sure whether HD is a good description however.
"One of the greatest game of all time! Age of Empires 2 has been my favorite since I was young and it sill my favorite until now. Some says that you are not an RTS-gamers yet before you played AOE2, and I think it's true.  AOE2 took place on medieval era where most of the great battles in our history occured. Play the campaign if you wanna learn more about Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Genghis Kahn, or Saladin. The stories are great and makes your history class look like crap. Play Skirmish or play Online to battle with other players. You can invite your friends to play along or just randomly join a room with another players.  This is one of the game that won't make you regret buying it whether you're an old-school gamers or just new."
Great job recreating the game for multiplayer support.
"Many a night of my childhood was spent playing this game. It's just one of thoes games you either hate it or love it, and I definitely love it. It's got a great feel, can be confusing to new players though, or if you haven't played it in a while. The DLC is all good. It's generally just such a good game and you wouldn't be making a mistake by buying it."
"This game is super fun to play, whether you are looking for a strategic challenge, or you are looking to control hundreds of villagers for a few hours. The feature of this game that I enjoy the most is the ability to build up the in-game economy."
"A true classic, works just like the original but with carefully updated graphics. Love it!"
"Classic real-time strategy at its best. 'Age of Empires II' is from a simpler age of RTS games with less resources to manage, more basic animations and a more basic set of rules. However, this means it's not bogged down in complicated concepts or overextensive resource managment.  With a wide range of cultures to play as and maps to play on, there's plenty of fun to be had on the custom game modes whilst the campaign(s), like in most RTS games, feels a little limp. Online gameplay is largely stable and it is often not too difficult to find an opponent of your own level, though personally I'd always recommend playing with friends.  The £15 price-tag is reasonable if you're an RTS fan wanting a nostalgia hit. General RTS fans may want to wait for a slightly lower price."
"very good recreation, exactly like the original"
"still just as good as i remember, everybody should own this masterpiece of a game"
Still one of the best RTS's out there   Online is working again thanks to steam.  
"A blast from the past, awesome classic game with endless hours of stratergy either against ai or players or friends. "
You should definitely give it a try. This is one of my favourite strategy games I've ever played and I remember how my father kicked my ♥♥♥ with the Persian elephants.lol xD
A classic among classics!
I wish i had as much time to play this as i did in my childhood
There are probably not very many games released last millennium that can claim to still have a constant player base of thousands. 17 years old and still going strong - for good reason.
Great game since 1350
Still a great game today
"One of the greatest games of strategy ever made, the first PC game I've ever played back when it was still Age of Empires II.  Remember one the greatest games ever with better perfomance and graphics but with some minor changes in gameplay but most of these were made to balance the civilizations.  Lots of civs to play with and everyone of them is diferent. It has many campaings to play on singleplayer and it's fun to play against the AI. Different modes to play and Workshop support with much more content to add to the original game. When you get bored of playing alone you can try multiplayer, eventhough it can take a while to find a good match and some lagginess while playing it's still fun and challenging to play with other persons"
"This is one of the best RTS games of all time inmy opinion, I don't get as much time to play it now, however I enjoyed playing it very much when it was first released and it still plays well today.  Many older games can often be quite difficult to pick up I find, especially newer strategy games. With AoE the gameplay mechanics are well refined though, meaning that the game is pretty easy to pick up and play for a newcomer especially if there is some RTS experience. You have to balance four resources; stone, wood, gold and food. To get these is pretty simple, although there is strategy involved as you have to build villagers and decide which resource to gather. Do you go for wood, or do you place more emphasis on food? You also need to consider how many villagers to build, and if you are building more you may need to raise the population cap with more houses. Getting your resource management right is a big part of the game, however it becomes easier the more you play.  As for the gameplay mechanics, they pretty much stand the test of time. Simply drag and select your units and click them on an enemy/building to attack. You also can set formations for your units if you feel the need. As well as this you have hotkeys which you can use to circumvent the menus when building. Generally speaking the controls are very well refined and definitely stand the test of time. Another thing worth mentioning is in the bottom right is your minimap, next to it is a 'find villager' button which locates any idle villagers. This is a huge help in-game.  The HD version doesn't really feel much different from the original, the resolution is updated however this version is basically just the original updated for 2013. It's also great to see the game is still being updated with expansions, especially now given the demise of the Age of Empires series. "
The game where you can explore the map with one sheep only. Isn't is the best use of a farm animal? :)
"Great game.  Was good back in 1999, and is still great in 2016. Is a perfect example of good games made to last.  10/10 would play again in 2030"
I like this game because it had arrows and they are my favorite type of row. Also it had swords which are pointy and I am made of nothing but pointy things so i felt it was a tribute to my pointiness. In conclusion this game is great and all american school children should play it as part of their normal curriculum.
"Awesome game, i really love it, old times, very good strategy game"
Can confirm this game has passed the test of time.
"This survives the test of time, love it."
"A timeless classic. Simple mechanics, but a huge amount of depth.  HD remake isn't overly HD, but it enables it to work on new systems, and to play easily with Steam friends. Worth it on special."
"Great to play with a few of your friends. Although, don't include too many unit slots if you decide to play against the computer."
Most awesome choice to improve and bring AOE2 back!! Def love the Workshop integration :D
Awesome game still love it to this day!
"It brings back great old memories :,D"
Quite simply one of the best games I have ever played
"I havent played this much and im not a huge fan of strategy games, but this game is amazing. This is definetly worth the money."
"Had this game since '99. Bought it again with the M$ RTS collection awhile back ( which I own all on CD) for the sake of not carrying the CDs with me. Also hoped to be able to play on my older computer, yet I cannot since it has been optimized. So if youre looking for games to use on older machines, this and the bundled ones wont be able to. Otherwise, It still holds up just like almost 20 years ago.   protip for online matches though: do not create maps of ludacris size; the coding cannot handle it and will lag and eventually crash the match."
So many good times playing this game =).
"I was positively exhilarated when I heard that this gem from my childhood was to be remastered in HD, and boy was I joyed when the expansions hit! It warms my heart to see this game alive and kicking once more. The added content and balance patches are more than welcome. The Campaigns are well made and challenging, and the multiplayer against other players or competitive AI gives nearly unlimited replay value - especially with all the mods one can get from the Steam Workshop. Also, the possibility to try out the DLC civilizations in rotation is a nice way to let players try out the new content without having to buy the DLCs. Overall, great value. Timeless classic."
"Ive had this game for a long time. I played this when I was a kid. Im not the best player or even one of them though.  This game will always be one of those games that I can come back to and enjoy. Especially with friends.  Its a must have. It isnt perfect, but its amazing."
Still a really fun game. Spent a lot of hours in this when I was a kid
This game should be Nominated for Test of Time award. This game is truly timeless
"I used to play this game a lot years ago. My friends and I picked it up and have been playing in matches against the computer.  + lots of history flavored units and buildings + lots of variety + multi-player is why I bought it and it does not disappoint + random map generation + you get to build castles, and walls, and kill baddies + I love winning by Wonder or by Relic + lots of single player and multi-player content  - there are waay too many civilizations sometimes - don't like how you can't research 100% for your civilization; that it measures what you've researched against all possible technologies - the map editor doesn't have basic editing features like palettes and brush sizes - when the game is over it pauses the game and then tells you to quit--why don't you just pause the game and bring up the pertinent menu? seems lazy to me - the single player campaigns did not hold my attention"
It never gets old beating enemies and rounding up all those sheep so I keep them as pets and don't murder them for their meat.  Til bardaga!
One of the best RTS of all time
this game definitely holds up to the grand memories of playing Age of Empires II when I got it from the Kellogs Cornflakes packets in the 90's
"Either you play to crush your opponents with cunning tactics or just swarming them with man-at-arms.  This is personnaly the best RTS game that exists as of yet, great soundtrack, easy to comprehend and yet can be hard to master. Everyone and their mother can find to like within."
"This game it's awesome, it brings me back memories from when i was a kid all the time, the AI is pretty tough in upper difficulties and its easy on lower ones, this gives new and old players options to enjoy the game, it has workshop compatibility so you can download maps and skins for your soldiers and peasants"
HD fire brought me here!
Test of time award!!
"Hot damn. I missed this game so much I had to buy it.  The resolution isn't very high, however, and it's hard to scroll back and forth. However, this game is still amazing."
"wolololo best rts, the genre has de-evolved into mobas, aoe is where its at!"
The perfect RTS. Great to play with friends.
"This game should run better than the old game on newer computers. I wish someday they would do Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds HD edition. Speaking of which, Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds is out on steam."
"The nostalgia hit me so hard. The game is just as fun now as it was back at release. A moderately paced, simple RTS with many different tech trees to play around with.  Had to gift a copy to my father so we could play together again like when the game was first released."
This game is a nostalgia machine for someone like me who played the first Age of Empires on my older cousin's PC back in the day. Glad to see it on Steam.
Wololo
"Always been a great game, now the HD update makes it even better. What's not to love?"
Same as was before
This was my very first video game.  Still holds up.
Felt like 1998. Would go back in time any time 5/7.
"classical nostalgia, seems I'm taken back by time machine"
"They did a great job of doing this up into HD only downside is the fact you cant chage the resolution or refreh rate but it's an old game these days, but it's a clasic"
"This is AoE II. There isn't a whole lot that needs to be said. They updated the graphics (some), smoothed things out, and added a bunch of free content. It's a classic with some icing on top, and everyone knows icing makes everything better. Buy it."
Classic game that is brought to the modern era.
Always a classic.
"A timeless RTS classic, remastered and now looking better than ever!  Fisk, wololo, santiago!"
This game was played since it came out in my household a tradition to do whenever we wernt doing dishes or working outside. this game is the reason i love computers and why i have a close relasionship with my father. a true classic there ever was.
"A timeless classic.  Simple to pick up, hard to master. The game revolves more around the strategy of controlling/allocating resources and countering tactics/units rather than memorizing hotkeys or micro-ing.   It's so cheap for the base game that I'd just flat out recommend buying it without any further thought. This is well known for being THE best RTS of all time, and for good reason."
"an amazing game, and a steal at current sale prices. i remember playing this game over a deade ago, and i still play it to this day."
"AoE 2 is in my opinion, the best out of the series. Best buy I have, played it since I was 12 and still enjoy it and the history it has; awesome game."
I love it the multiplayer works great and it also come with the conquerors expansion already unlike the actual cd-rom game. And you can choose to play co-op which is a great new feauture.
"Easy to have fun, damn hard to be good against solid AI or online. A great RTS with great inter-civilization parity. The best player wins and 'best' tends to be he with the most ability use the force of ADD for good as there is so much to focus on."
"One of the best strategy games ever, simply. Not much to say if you've played the original version, it's the same with better graphics. period. I would advise the 'The Forgotten' expansion if you can get it for cheap (0.70£ the other day)."
Converted an elephant and a building. 10/10
"First game ever played, lost the disc ages ago but Steam to the rescue."
A classic... I only wish there were more techs and battle units. Sometimes the simplicity of the game is to simple. 4.5/5
"played this game year's now and still one of the best around, top notch entertainment. if you like building,collecting,and attacking this game is for you, might look abit old compared to newer games but still packs a punch 5/5."
"Spent 15 minutes building what I thought was a good economy, only to get raided by 100+ knights and archers with no defense strategy what-so-ever.  10/10 would die to that again."
"(This is an old review, written again. The old review was very messy and based on my emotions towards a certain aspect that I will mention in here as well.)  Age of Empires 2 is a game I had loved AND it was one of the first more mature games that I have ever played on PC. Back then I was alot younger and mainly played games for... well... kids. I mean, I was like nine years old when I first played it and that mainly due to my father. But what I got is what I loved from that moment on. And in fact it changed my gaming future as it now became one of my favorite genres in gaming. I just loved how much you had to think about what you had to do and how you manage your own people and troops.  But of course, as time went on the games I played varied and AoE was forgotten. Until one day, years later, I found that old disc and shoved into the, now new, PC. Safe to say that it didnt live up to standards. Simply because Windows 7 and old AoE just dont really fit together anymore. At some point the game just broke on me and I couldnt play it anymore. I was sad until i found out about the HD remake of AoE2 on Steam. I instantly bought it and kinda did the same as before. I hopped into a sologame. Aaaaaaand I got rekt by the PC cause it was the highest difficulty.  But now I was looking for something new. When I first played the game I did everything. Played solo, the campaigns, made my own campaigns and all the good stuff. But, I never played online. And since I didnt really wanted to repeat it all, I thought: 'Lets have some fun online!' And, well, so I went online and had a good time! Or at least that is what I would if it would be true.  You know, I understand how a game (especially when its played online) can turn competetive. I myself want to win the game as well. Nothing bad about that, right? But when the whole experience turns into competetive garbage, the fun is left behind. The first time I went into the online experience I got about 6 people. We played on four Islands and I was together with someone else on one of them. So we said that we would not fight each other and declared each other as allies. We built our defenses and got some good stuff up. Until, all of the sudden, one of his guys started to attack my people. And soon after that he ran in with his whole entire army to just wreck my stuff. Safe to say that I was kind of surprised. You can win this game with an ally but this guy just went for it.   Being a bit disapointed and angry I started a second game, after that cluster♥♥♥♥ and got about 7 people. This time we played on solid ground with only a few rivers here and there. I I noticed that one of the guys was fairly close so I had to build up my wooden walls. But I soon, not having reached the first age milestone, realised how I was already attacked by a good amount of military units of the guy close to me. And again, I was disapointed. I had lost the game, soon after it started just because I didnt do the same thing he did, which is literally bumrushing the enemy.  And here comes the thing. Upon looking up what is going on, I found out that these are the strategies of the players today. There is no more old school strategy involved with working together or simply hoarding all of it for yourself. No trading, no building up your best stuff to send the army against the army of the other guy. Its simply just 'Kill when he least expects it' or 'Bumrush him so I dont have to fear him later on'. And here is my question for people like this: Where is the fun in that? I mean, I would get it if this would be like CS:GO where you level up and play against other grand players. But this is a game that is as casual as it can get. And to be honest, you are ruining the game for people that have never even played a strategy game.  So, would I recommend AoE2? Yea. I would. But not because of the Multiplayer. If you want to have a good time with an oldschool game and play some solo games, go for it. If you never played multiplayer or dont know any advanced techniques: DONT PLAY IT."
"I loved the game. I loved that it was HD. But since the new DLC its unplayable for me. I have 1 hour since then. Why you ask? Not cause its a bad DLC.. No cause me, and so do my friends, have lags as hell. The game is unplayable. Even against bots. If it would be only me i would think its something with my PC.. But no, its not only me. And it hurts me a little.. Cause i loved to play this in my spare time."
Great to replay this game once again! higly reccomend to other to buy it if you ever loved the franchise when you were younger :D
10/10  Would Wololo again.
"This game has stood the test of time - and then some. Great Steam Workshop support, great community and infinite replayability. Highly recommended."
how do you turn this on
Pure Gold.
"WOLOLO  I played this game when I was young and learned about historical battles WAY before I was taught about them in history classes.  Interesting campaigns, always fun to see a game progress from sticks to guns.  It's a core game for the RTS genre where you manage several types of resources, and balance economy and military and test your might against other civilizations/empires."
Still A great game after all these years.
"This was my first RTS a long, LONG time ago. So many good memories, including a game that started with 8 people, lasted 3 days (effective playtime was more like 30 hours), of which the last 8 hours was just a friend against me which I won only because I spotted his navy by sheer luck while it was in the move. Also, history tests were a breeze having learned quite a bit from reading the info and playing the campaigns. If I ever reproduce I'll make sure my spawnlings play this game until they can beat me."
A timeless classic RTS.
I was a king in my childhood.
"I so happy when this went on Steam as i had been playing the games on their orginal disk, but with operating systems coming out every year I know ill have this game for many more years"
"As great as I remember , note that if you have problems with sync and lag download the open beta 4.8 it will fix it"
Great nostalgic game to play with friends.
The “Test of Time” Award
15 years playing and it still is the best RTS I've ever played
It's a classic. Battal!
It's Age of Empires II in HD.  Do i need to say anything more?
A worthy contender of the Nato Timeless Classic Award. If you haven't yet please vote for this as the Nato Timeless Classic Award. Thanks guys :)   Oh btw this game goes down alright.
It's the best RTS game I've played.
This is a great classic game that is even better with the Steam Workshop support. It truly stands the test of time!
"Worth money, great classic."
"After all these years, my wife, the kids and I still fire this game up and have fun :) Also leads to a bit of a history lesson for the family. I enjoy the straight forward nature of this RTS, before they get too complicated with Heroes or move from Rock Paper Scissors to a convoluted game of 'Rock, Paper,Scissors,Lizard,Spock'."
"I loved this game when I had it back when I was young, I love it even more now, and I can test myself and try complete the game on higher difficulties :D Just buy this game, it's one of the best RTS games out there."
"Perfection remastered. It's an unbelievable feat of work that now works with Windows 7, say goodbye to the magenta water and say hello to no 200 pop limit. I loved this game as a kid and I love it now. It's strategy at full fruition. The balance between Military, Society, and Economy are all crucial in this game and it's a great challenge for anyone of any skill level. Competitve is a little ridiculous for any newbie, but we all have to start somewhere. So go on, play it, do it and I promise you, you won't be disappoined.            Oh yeah, WOLOLOOOOOOO"
Great old school game.
if you like time consuming games with friends this is jsut for you. &lt;3 
Is a classic game of plans and counter measures. And of course being the one survives...
YOLOLO!!!!  Play this to test friendships.
"This game holds quite a bit of nostalgiac value to me, as well as genuinely enjoying the gameplay. I certainly recommend this game, but be wary of the little changes to the actual game. While they increased the population limit to 500, they did not increase the max amount of units can select. Also, the AI is just as doofy as ever. The biggest problem I probably had with it is the fact that the AI seems omnipotent at any given moment. It seems like there's no handicap against the bots, them immediately complete tasks, crapping out ground soldiers and ships like there's no tomorrow. Maybe I'm just a tiny baby-man who can't 'git gud', but I have a distinct memory of being able to run a train on the AI without cheats. All in all, it's a great game, just don't pay $19.99 for it."
It's a fantastic strategy game but with some major online issues that are slowly beeing worked out by the devs.
one of my all time favorite games.
I've been playing this game since 1998 and I believe I'll play it forever
no need another RTS
"An absolute masterpiece. I have played this game since i was a kid, and with the remaster it showed itself again on an (somewhat) better form."
Nominated AoE II for The “Test of Time” Award. Great game I still play to this day.
"Strats of the world, conquest or search and destroy ¨*"
.
"Loved it and played it when it came out originally, still love it and play it casually to this day."
Best of best in this category !
"15 years later, im still playing this game, AoE is one of the best games of all time!"
I guess I will be playin' this in 25 years.
Definitely a game you should try if you never played it before.
"Age of Empires II is still as deep and addictive as before, and new HD version is a brilliant addition for fans who have been waiting for an upgrade to the old strategy classic. Despite beeing a 17 years old game (damn has it realy been that long?). The mechanics still holds up and the new Steam integration works great."
Can anyone even get tired of playing AoE ??
truly epic..
Its one of the games you played when didnt really know what games where yet. Long afternoons in the school library playing with your friends.  Ok that but made prettier.
A classic and essential
"Played it back in the days, played it now. Freaking awesome and legendary."
nice game either for those RTS starters or those who want to nostalgia.
Easily one of the best real time strategy games out there. Holds up very well despite being over 10 years old.
Love it!
I loved playing this in College... though I feel with this version and using it on stream finding people to play with just got a WHOLE lot easier. Can't wait to play through some more and see how it compares!
this is a good stradegy game
"Game hasn't really been improved at all. The only real difference is that the multiplayer actually works. The lag hasn't been fixed, you would have thought that was the first thing to on their list. Hot keys are a bit of a mess too.  The game is as good as the old version only with a more stable multiplayer."
"Until I started playing Starcraft II, AoE II was the only PC game I played until High School. Between that, Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zooo Tycoon, this game took up days of playtime in my youth. Albeit, there are some frame rate issues and some issues in multiplayer that I've heard about, though not myself experienced, if you want to play what I consider one of the best RTS games made, I'd make it a definite buy, especially during summer sale. You can't beat 75% off."
The Workshop for this game is amazing!!! =D
"Commanded one of my builders to build a few houses for more resident space, traps himself inside a ring of houses and forces me to pick between him and a house... Lets say the property value dropped.  11/10"
hey bros this game is mad fun if u enjoy death i assure you this game is something youll remember playing or not bc youll be dead idfk i have 6 arms
"Classic RTS. Not too complex but not too simple. Throw in some cheat codes and steam roll the computer during a lunch break or play by the rules with friends anywhere in the world. This is the best way to experience the game.   Hoping they allow for populations higher than 500 in future releases. I'd love 2,000. That would be an amazing way to experience AOE warfare."
They increased the maximum population size to 500. You can make 500 petards/priests/cannon galleons.
Bad graphics  0/10
can't change game resolution in game or outside of game in the advanced options
how do you turn this on
RTS Just doesn't get any better than this.   I've been playing this game since I was given my first PC (Gateway 2000) in 4th grade. It's STILL fun to this day. What are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW!   BRING BACK RISE OF ROME IN HD PLEASE!
"the expansion blows tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, dracula campaign is sooo buggy i cant even enjoy this crappy old school game anymore"
Classic game of RTS! Highly recommended!
"Simply a higher resolution version of the classic medieval RTS we all know and love. Works in windows 7 too, so that's a plus!"
This game is amazing and really well balanced
Good. One of the best old RTS games out there.
"amazing game, always has been always will be"
Standard multiplayer crashes a lot! It is a great game that held a lot of fun for many many years and with HD even better But why so many bugs?
"This game is worth the price. It has both single player and multi-player FUN!! It's nice to have to think strategy while playing a game, which is different from most games now a days."
One of the classics! Played it back in the day and still play it now. Totally worth it
"A great and very nostalgic game ,Besides the old gameplay and features there’s internet multiplayer and now you can have up to 500 units all in HD !! Spent hours playing :)"
Cees is The best OOP MLGER 360 nocper
I played this game when I was a kid - and loved it. Now I play this game as an adult - and love it! What more is to say about one of the best strategy games of all times?
Best strategy game of all time!
"Good HD edition, but still has room for improvment."
One of the BEST RTS games ever!
"I have played a lot of strategy games, and I am not sure what it is about AOEII that keeps me playing it over others, but I do."
10/10 will raid enemy with sheeps again
"This game just never gets old, I remember first playing it when I was 4!"
Love this game the first time I played it years ago and still love it now
This is a great way to pass 73 hours. This game will make you lose weight because you'll forget to eat all weekend.
"For original AoE2 players, the HD version will not disappoint. Just as fun as the original, but with less eye-shredding pixelation.  For people who have not played AoE2 before, I fully recommend it. It's a classic for a reason, and the price is reasonable."
Had a very fortified city untill one villager cut a path through the woods to have a massive gap in my wall  10/10 would create this massive gap again
"This game is perhaps the best game that I have ever played. It never gets boring and it's just so much fun. I like the fact hat they have lots of civilizations and features that go with it, and a map editor. The only thing that I disliked is that they're not so specific on the civilizations, because I'm from Denmark and it would be nice to have Danish Vikings in the game. Although they do reference us in the history page yet the Danish Vikings were the best Vikings, and I'm not just saying that because I am Danish. I say that because lots of countrys used to quake in fear of the Danes. Now they think that we're the capital of Sweden."
"Great game lots of fun on multiplayer, especially with and against friends. Lots of strategies can be used, early rushes or build up economy for a massive late game army. Each civ has different economic and military bonuses as well as a unit unique to each civ which can make certain strategies more advantagous. e.g Mongol gather food from wild animals faster than other civs which makes their economy stronger early game making an feudal rush a good tactic to cripple the opponents economy before they can bring out units to combat yours. Campaign stories are pretty interesting as well although not always historically accurate."
"One of the best RTS games ever, exactly the same as in 1999."
strategy classic 7.5/10
GET IT
"An amazing RTS With so much to learn and master, Not just good for nostalgia but this can stand on its own as well, If you are a fan of real time stratagy you will not be dissapointed"
"My go to RTS, i feel like i can always get a real challange playing this. #buffteutons"
"Hands down the best RTS game ever, and is still going strong. Easy to pick up for new players as well.  (Nominated as well for the Autumn Sale 2016)  10/10"
I can't believe I am still spending thousands of hours on this last century game! Great remake!
You don't like this game...?  'Wololo'
"Great game, used to play it all the time back when I was a kid!"
been playing this game since it first came out in the 1990s and I still love it!
nostalgia...   games were more fun when i was young...  work hard everyday to bring meal on the table and to cover rent for home makes me less focused on games thesedays...  now i understand why people commit suicide
"Why play against other players when you and your friends can't beat the bots on moderate difficulty. Great strategy game that is perfect in every way. Buy it, play with friends, break your keyboard in frustration as the base you spent one hour building gets annihilated in 5 minutes."
"Great game, brought back nostalgia from when i used to play AOE1 as a kid. worth the buy to ♥♥♥♥ around with friends and to extend your experience there is a pretty solid modding community!"
"This game is a revival of an all time classic and is a must to every pc gamer's library.   Very balanced, great online community, still being updated and getting better, large amount of user generated content like mods and custom maps, extremely beautiful graphics and music. What else can i add? This game is one of them that comes instantly to mind when you hear the term 'RTS'. Do yourself a favor and try it out.  Disclaimer: In order to have a proper online multiplayer experience (and not get utterly destroyed in everygame) you should watch some commentated expert games on youtube and learn some basic strategies etc. There are many channels that are part of the community like Spirit of the law, T90official, Resonance22, Zeroempires etc that will help you get in the spirit of PvP games really fast."
Classic game! Friggin love this game will play with ANYONE WHO CHALLENGES MEEEEEE
Just as good as it was when the game first came out. Pure 10/10. Classic.
"To start of this review, the score I would like to give is a 9. I give a 10 to compensate for people who judge before a game is even out. For the HD part: they managed to up the resolution to max and also retexture a 14 year old engine, which is pretty impressive in my opinion. Regarding the framedrops: when we got the privilege to play the game before it is officially out doesn't mean they will have every bug fixed, otherwise they could just release it for everyone at that time. As soon as they heard about this problem the devs posted on multiple multimedia sites and their own site that they are working on the problem right now. The game has been out for a few minutes now while people know that the devs are doing their best to work on the issues, so please show some patience. The real addition of this however is the online. The servers for the original AOE II were pulled long ago, and now we have new servers to play this still awesome game online with friends. Oh, and did I mention steam workshop? This means that we will see a lot more mods to keep te game alive even longer. All in all, a great idea worked out great, with some bugs at the start. It's also a nice way to show that for some games it doesn't matter how old they are, it's all about the gameplay, just like how you don't care about graphics when playing a cardgame"
"I loved this game when I was younger, it is great to see it 're-imagined'. It would have been nice if the civilizations were a little more distinguishable from one another, however, overall it is a wonderful game."
This is a good game. I like it.
"For 10+ years I've played Age of Empires II as well as the quickly released expansion, The Conquerors. And until the release of the HD version I was all but certain the game had died out. But now seeing the effect of the Steam platform and a visual improvement (as well as improvements to population cap and map size) it's incredible how alive the community has become. The game is fun in single-player in its own right, just as the Civilization franchise is, but the true experience comes from either campaigns or from online play. And now with The Forgotten expansion, players can take on 5 new civs with unique visuals and new technologies. It's easily my game of the year this year."
Best RTS ever created.
This game is the modernisation of AOE 2 from my childhood. Its every bit as good except it doesn't enjoy the same large following it once had.
Pros: -The classic Age of Empires II + its expansion -Improved graphics and AI -New game modes -Retains the vibe of the original game  Cons(EDITED 30/11/2014): -Nothing currently.
"It's age of empires 2, what more do I need to say? :D"
"Classic Real-Time Strategy Game at its FINEST!  I would say I'm a Age of Empires II fans myself when I was 10 back then. I used to play this game with myself and what I played back then was only campaign mode (can't remember the story of the game XD). I loved it more than Starcraft and Command and Conquer.  I am very glad that this game got a HD remastered. AND AN EXPANSION after like what.... 8 years of release? IT'S AMAZING.  For people who like this series, it's a must buy. For people who likes RTS, I also recommend this game to you. (I personally think II is a better game than III). The difference between the civilizations are very nicely represented by its in-game graphics, viewtiful graphics considering it was made in 1999, and an in-depth gaming mechanics that requires tons of time trying out strategies.  It seems like the community and the publishers didn't give up this game since they are having streamings every now and then. Check them out sometimes if you can't decide, maybe the streaming will give you an answer. But for me, I highly recommend this game to you."
"If you liked playing AOE2 online like I did, you will love that you can play online again with this version!"
"Very good game, I see memories from long time ago when I played on PSX/PS2. Definately worth this price !"
!
How have you not already played this?
"It was one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever made, and still is. The updated version adds very little (unless you get the Forgotten DLC), but in the end of the day it is the same game you know and love, and it aged really well too. The best part is that it runs on pretty much any system with no tweaking necessary. If you haven't played an RTS before, this is also a great game to start off with; beginners and veterans will enjoy it alike. AoE 2 is fun to play alone, and especially with friends. Overall, I think this game is definitely worth a buy."
I like the bunny
A really nice back to the basics. This AOE is awesome in multiplayer !!
You can destroy a building with arrows. 10/10
"When I was a lil' folk, I was intrigued by this game like love at first glance. Mainly because this was my first RTS, I liked many things, the historical background, the battles, the need to gain resources, the castles, everything. I dunno man, I also liked the view, it was like watching a mini world growing (like a god) (damn I also liked thomas the train 'cuz of the miniature world for the same reason).  With time I knew other and more diverse RTS, like Imperium, Command and Conquer, Starcraft, etc. But I share a special feeling to the wololo series. Sid meier's games might have been revolutionary at their time, but AoE, was for many the approach into RTS, and it made standards for the marquet.  Simple, yet complicated. I bought the DLC, just beauce of Dracula, but I really would not recommend it, it's not the big thing, and it has an special multiplayer (which mostly is inhabited by AoE pros).  Sadly, the multiplayer suffers from lag problems most of the time. Anyway though I always loved RTS games, I always sucked at them, I have never won a multiplayer match, I still love the game."
I highly enjoyed it before it's resurface to HD. It is still really enjoyable.
"Don't know why people are whining about it being the same game, when it clearly just says it has been improved with HD graphics and better multiplayer, which it does fine. The game itself is even better than the original because you get 500 population limit, and better graphics/resolution."
Childhood memories from this. Instant buy
Many years since I played the game for the first time and still interestid and with the ability to make my day :) Totally recommendable!!!
Just as good as the old one.
This game is so nostalgic! This is truley a game u want to play! trust me :D
Totally would spam saboteurs again
Great game. I have even more hours from before steam!
"First PC game I ever played, still as good as ever"
It's HD!
cool
"Well, it's been a long time since I played this game. Is it as good as I remember it? Heck no it's better then I remember it! Now with a brand spankin new community and multiplayer back up for one of the games that made my late childhood, I'd reccomend picking this bad boy up, wouldn't you~?"
"Don't be scared away by the 69 review from Metacritic (most of the bad reviews are because they didn't really change much other then the graphics). This is a fantastic game, that might be a little bias since this was one of my childhood games, but it is a really good game. The campaigns are really fun and multiplayer is also fun with a bunch of friends. Can't really come up with any complaints, the AI is not stupid like every other strategy game. I haven't played it for years, but playing on normal is even a challenge. To me it has stood the test of time and you will spend hours playing this game."
Wololo
 http://youtu.be/zIyOTUrG9ak?t=55s 
"AoE II is an amazing strategy which has aged gracefully over the years. Even though it may be dated, this game still can steal hours away, why, because it is simple and fun. This game has all you could want and anyone from a seasoned vet who wants to build an empire all the way to a 4th grader just learning the ropes, there is no base skill or RTS knowlege required to jump in and have loads of fun."
Classic game! The hd edition is an excellent addition to the game and the forgotten dlc adds tonnes of content. 9/10!
"This is the old classic we all know and love. It's technically an RTS but just like Company of Heroes is nothing like Total War. The 2D Graphics are very good considering it's release in 1999 two years after it's predecessor. This game is a brillinat game and i definitely recommend picking it up. However, the 'HD' part of the tilte can definitely be disputed. Despite this you can still get some better HD textures from the Steam Workshop along with some maps and other add-ons, unless you're like me and prefer the classic textures. 8/10"
"AoE 2 has a tremendous sense of scale that other RTS games lack. City-building, the games' most fundemental and neccisary gameplay aspect, is intricate and interesting, and the combat and conquest (should you so choose) aspects of gameplay are well balanced and deeply tactical. Unit AI are smart, quickly organising themselves into formations of your choice (also very easy to pick up), making managing large numbers of men and machinery a simple task, which is just as well. There are many, MANY other things that need your attention. Age of Empires 2 is the Ultimate Example of 'Easy to learn, Tricky to master', and probably one of the best the genre has to offer, even years after its release."
"If you liked age of empires when it came out you'll like it now, still the same classic game you would expect."
Super fun game with friends
"Still a great game, love the updates and expansions"
"more active players than the new COD 20 year old game they still update, patch and release DLC teutonic knights are beasts hit 22 in the chat log over and over test of time RTS. &lt;3"
It's aight
"This game is still my favourite after all these years. Yes it will cause you anger and it will make you stay awake late at night, just to finish one mission!"
Amazing time-consuming game!
"Originally released in 1999 this classic can still keep up with modern games in it's genre. The game itself is rather easy to grasp, but hard to master, especially against other players.  Certainly recommended for any rts fan. Have fun playing!  oh.. and one more thing: Wololo!"
This masterpiece withstands the time itself.
Still a good old game. :)
Epic battles for hours what else can you ask for?
"This game has a very simple concept, build through the ages to make the greatest empire. But to keep your empire you have to fight with armies chosen by outthinking your opponent. Not every army is build the same way, you have to think to outplay your opponent. Never make a one sided army which can be crushed by different one sided army. Mix your armies and outthink your opponent. Also never forget your economy, without resources you won’t make it far. This game is mix between resource management and making clever use of the units you have to your disposal."
It is old but gold.
This is one of my favorite games ever. It has largely stood up to the test of time and is still immensely enjoyable even today.
I like this game . Playing with friends is fun
Probably the best RTS ever.
I made my parents believe that I am learning for my history exam while playing this game.  10 / 10 would 'Wololo' again...
I've been playing this game on and off since the Microsoft Zone days and it is still one of my favorites. The new content is also pretty good.
WOLOLO. It's AoE II with new stuff! It's as awesome as it's ever been.
The remastered looks really good. I can not remember how many hours I used it playing when I was a child. A 'must have' in any library.
"Pure Nostalgia, and its just as good as it was back then!"
The worst but also the best HD version of an old game
"I remember watching my dad playing this game and asking him to let me play it when I was 10  This game is bloody good! Even though I'm such a noob at this since the first time I started to play it, I just love it, when I played it as kid I never had the chance to play it online, then I found out it was on steam, it was very exciting to play this game online, just make sure you're good enough to play online, otherwise you'll be called a noob (As it happened to me)  Just brilliant, you've got to be quick on getting resources to build up your civilisation and army before the enemy comes to destroy you. Be Quick or Be Dead, simple as that  This is an oldie but goldie! Totally recommended.  "
It feels just like the old times. One of the best games ever.
Well done remake of a classic game of a genre which is not popular and there are no comparable games to this one. Quite sad to be honest.
My history teacher could not compete.
"4,5/5"
A classic restored to life.
King scouts better than the scout  10/10 realism - IGN
As fun rediscovering the game now as playing is when I was a kid. Definetly worth the money!  9/10
The (second) greatest game of all time. Highly recommended.
The one instance where Microsoft Studios themselves were struck by genious. If you want to have an fast and easy time with semi-historic real time strategy while battleing some Steam friends - this is even after such a long time your best bet.
"They redid a lot of the graphics, flame animations, etc. and it looks great on a massive display."
Good game to play with friends.
I have nominated Age of Empires II HD 2 for a Steam Award. And so should you.
"the best game out there if you're looking for an RTS game , teaches about history ,civilization blah blah ,tho this HD version have some issues !"
  Great game if you want an old game in a new skin!
"A classic returns, a game that introduced lots of people into gaming is now aviable again to remember the good old memories."
THE “JUST 5 MORE MINUTES” AWARD
"I've played this game since I was 6. I still play it to this day.  If you like RTS, this is an absolute must own, especially when it's on sale for it usually is 85-90% off.  Get the new expansions too.  Edit: wololo"
10/10 would wolololo again
"10+ years later, im still playing this game, AoE is one of the best games of all time!"
*Losing* How do i turn this on? 10/10 Would turn it on again
This is one of the best games of all times. We keep getting back to it and it seems that the age suits it :)
Timeless classic. Of course there's a lot wrong with the HD edition having performance issues and things outright dysfunctional for years on end without them being fixed (good thing there's voobly though) But it's still god damn master of slow RTS Age of friggin Empires. Now that's a good idea!
"This game truly stands the test of time. I played it when it was new and I was new to games. I loved it and spent countless hours on it. Then it was rereleased in HD on steam and I figured why not get it, since it was such a blast back then for me?  Turns out it was the right move, since I find myself spending hours on occasion playing it and reliving the great moments in AoE II. The campaigns are great just like I remember, if not better with the HD and everything, but I haven't had a chance to try out the new campaigns yet. Also, the map editor is amazingly fun as always to dedicate hours to!"
Absolute classic they need to make a new one
The Greatest RTS that Ever Was or Will Be...
Still going strong 17 years and counting
This is a true classic game that has set the standards for the entire RTS genre.
'test of time'
"one of the all time classics, brings back a lot of good memories :D  hope we get to see new civs added with time, keep up the good work on this one devs!"
"Everyone should give this game the, 'Best Use of a Farm Animal Award' for their accurate portrail of sheep."
"One of the best real time strategy of all time.. A part of gaming history that tell the history of kingdom and empires. Recommended game, especially with the new African Kingdom DLC. :)"
Still best game since 1999 :D
One of my favorite RTS of all time. I still have the original box copy.  This game holds up well even against newer RTS. Highly recommend!
"This is literally the love of my childhood and i have been playing on easy for over 8 years, now its on steam."
pretty good
A great game that has been updated and brought to steam. I have great memories of this game from when I was younger. This game to me will be the game with which to judge all other RTS games that are released.
There is a game that I still play and replay and keep playin like nuts. This is one of my all time favorites and is so freakin fun to play!
Build the wall!
Wololo
Solid game play and an engaging single player campaing make this a classic.
Probably my favorite game of all time and it still holds up well to this day.
"Challenging and very fun to play, especially with friends. After all this years since launch it keeps receiving new content and maintaining a great community of players. 10/10."
Do you like video games? Do you like really old video games? Why not play a game that released in 1999 and still is one of the best examples of how ♥♥♥♥ing good an rts can be
"Despite a few crashes here and there, the replayability and challenges this game presents outweigh it ten fold. I can start a campaign only to realize 2 hours later that I'm still in the same match. I would highly recommend it!"
"Very good game still as fun as when I had it for my ye olde windows 2000. plus they fixed to graphical bugs. It's worth it at $20, but buy without delay if it's lower than $10."
Small updates to the original that improve it without unnecessarily changing it. Especially on sale this is worthwhile to pick up for a few bucks
"This is the game that got me into pc gaming, trully a game that will never go out of style in my opinion. If you have the means, I would suggest you get it."
+1
"Spend hours in map maker, then never play that map  10/10"
"An oldie but a goodie. When we get together to play LAN games (because we live in an area that has the ♥♥♥♥♥iest internet known to man, we don't plan online), we always bring this one out and play a few skirmishes. Even after all these years, the computer can still stomp us if we're not paying attention"
"This game is partly the reason why I'm studying history nowadays! It hasn't stopped amazing me. These new expansions are just awesome; new civilizations, new commands, new units, new ways to go through the game developing different strategies. I much recommend youtube tutorials to help you understand the tactics you can use in a random map playing against AI or an online match."
Still fun to go back a play a random map after 15 years.
NOSTAlGIA INTENSIFIES
Buildings have religious beliefs  10/10 would convert again
Bought Age of Empires 2 when it first came out. This only improves on it.
One of the best games ever!!!!
Very cool. Much Graphics. Wololo
"This game is a classic, brutal RTS. It is as fun to play today as it was 10 years ago."
"After a decade-plus of existence, Age of Empires II (Age of Kings) still delivers the goods. Balanced enough to be quick to pick up; deep enough to give even experienced players a hard challenge when battling one another.  Nominated for 'The Test of Time' Steam award"
"AOE II Is a game I played almost exclusively for almost 5 years, I may not have much time logged in the steam version but I've spent many many hours playing this game, just messing around against bots and playing some of the most intelligent matches I've played in any RTS or game period. The level of tactics required is not as high as other games like Hearts of Iron III of even CIV IV but it is a game with much depth and much to learn, I highly recommend it. "
A classic.  Everything is out there just as you remembered  Perfect.  I only miss the extended intro :(
"I'm doing this for badges. At any rate, good game even after all this time."
"This game far exceeded my expectations. I expected an rts game with a historically accurate story, multiple playable civilizations, and the ability to launch a 60 kg projectile over 200 meters. Instead, I got a game with a historically accurate story, multiple playable civilizations, and the ability to launch a 90 kg projectile over 300 meters. 10 out of 10."
"This is one of my all time favorite games, I have played it since i was little and I love being able to play it as an adult on my new computers. This game has truly stood the test of time. Though the new AI is a ♥♥♥♥♥ on the harder difficulties."
One of the best games of all time.
Best retro game of all times...
This got my nomination for the test of time award. It is simply amazing that a game released in 1999 still holds up this well and is getting exapnsions.   As with any game there are flaws but if you grew up on this game like myself you'll have no problem falling in love with it all over again.
0/10 too much water
Wololo
"One of the greatest RTS games in the history of video games. I grew up playing this game and it was one of the very first games I ever bought myself. To see it re-released as HD edition on steam is amazing. Basically, if you like swords, history, and general fun competitive game play, you should get this game."
"This game never gets old.  Played this game since I was little. And while I was growing up, this game did too.  HD remaster is maybe a big word, but it brings the game into a new age. It brings full screen HD size view of the map. instead of old 800px screen sizes.  The game gets updated to balance it burther. Make better AI. New civilizations.  I just like it."
What's there to say? If you played the original you'll love it. If you have not you'll still love it.
this game is an old classic. one of the best strategie games. This game got me in to gaming. So if you like strategie and classics this is the game for you
This is one of the best strategy games. I played this when i was 12. Now many years later its amazing that its still as good. Gameplay is perfect but what makes it great is the sounds and all the little touches.
"My favourite RTS of all time, now even harder than it used to be thanks to Skybox and Hidden Path.  This is the mold that all RTS games should start with. If your game isn't starting with the mechanics in this game, you're not doing it right."
Still the best strategy game ever!
"Best way to play AoE2 these days, especially on modern systems with modern monitors etc."
"One of the greatest strategy games ever made. Even so long after its initial release, the game is still fun to play. I am by no means a competitive player, so I can't comment about the finer details of the multiplayer. But I am still able to play online with my friends, so it's fine for me. The game is highly replayable, and there's plenty of mods that add scenarios and changes skins on buildings and units if you get bored of the vanilla look and feel. I give it a solid 8.5/10.  The main cons are performance issues in larger games and maps and a population cap of 500. If only it could be higher!"
So much fun to play. Been one of the first games i've played ever!
Old always school
  AMazing game im glad i quit my life to play this.. thanks you
Age of Empire 2   only one of few games there can evil other player with monks    well Monk rush 10/10
find all the sheeps
Excelent choice for remaster!
"This game is about as perfect as they come, there's something satifying about building a strong economy and then proceed to waste it and become so poor that you end up sending thousands of pikemen to their death in a desperate bid to over run your opponents thousands of pikemen."
"My Best RTS back in 2001, this game deserves a place in top 25 best games of 2000 decade and top 3 best RTS from the same time.  It has a lot os strategy involved, lots of civs you can choose from and get in love and now it has a lot of mods from the community from Steam Workshop, so it's a blast of content!   Everyone should try it! Very recommended!"
It's Age of empires 2. Says enough.
This is one of the most beautiful strategy game I have ever played. I first played this game in 2005 or something like that after all this time its good to see the same game again in steam. GJ microsoft
"Played this when i was 8 on gold edition but the disc got really scratched so it became unplayable, so this has brought back a lot of memories."
one of the best games. and the best AoE in the series.
"I'm happy to say that this game has aged terrifically. It's been years since I had played, and while I had to relearn things, I'm loving playing it again, now with the full HD support."
The all-time classics is now revamped and no longer broken.  I had great fun with my friends accompanied with the lord of the rings soundtrack available from the steam community workshop.  10/10
"Very Fun RTS, they converted it to HD very well. Just as fun as it was 10 years ago if not moreso."
"15 years ago, i loved this game. Today, I'm still loving it! AOE HD edition delivers!"
A classic that's still fun and rich as any RTS today! updated with new civilizations! Gimme!   I hope they bring Rise of Rome to steam as well.
An old game from my Childhood redone so it can be used on modern machines!  9/10  Nostalgic rating :P
Oh mean i love that game!
Probably my favorite real-time strategy game ever. I would recommend this game over the third addition of Age of Empires.
This is one of the best! Happy to see in HD and hope that all of bugs such as lags with big population on multiplayer are fixed :-)
Absolutely fantastic.
"Oldschool, but still fun."
"Always a Classic, good game"
"I would fully recommend getting this to anyone who enjoys strategy games. Now that obvious bit is over, onto the steam version of this classic game.  I again would recommend all people who enjoyed the game since it first came out to get this mainly for system/graphical reasons. I found that on Windows 7 when i installed from the disk version of Age of Empires II (which i still have even in 2013) it didn't fit the screen properly and there was some colouring issues. That simply comes from the age of the game. However with this edition all of those small bugs were fixed, and indeed while the graphics havn't been changed at all so it still feels like the original game, HD is a good term for this version as it all just feels sharper compared to the non steam version. The expansion that is steam release alone has given me enjoyment aswell, with a good couple of campaigns and new factions there (though I'm still trying to figure out a few new features which I read in the campaign but can't find in skirmish).   Overall, can't really fault the game on steam as it's exactly what it says it is; Age of Empires II. However, I'd suggest getting this while on sale, because £15 seems a bit excessive for a game of this age. With the new campaign included in that price I would find it reasonable. I managed to pick up AoE III the complete edition, AoE II HD AND the Forgotten expansion this Christmas sale for £7.49. I don't recommend getting AoE II alone for anything above that, especially as the extra content isn't included."
"Fun to play with friends, but the games get a little on the too long side for me. But recommended to buy on the cheap days of Sales"
"The AoE franchise strikes me as one which favours big macro and big swings, or at least that's where the game really shines. You can have a big army and still end up wanting and needing specialized support troops. The balance naturally nudges you into a diverse playstyle. It creates a different feel than other RTSes. The way the tech tree feeds into and back out of the Town Hall for Age advancement makes macro feel noticably different and novel. You can have C&amp;C and SC/WC and still get a fresh feel here."
"Just as I did in my childhood with the original and AoE 2, chances are you'll spend most of your time in the map editor making absolutely massive armies of random units fight each other just to see the absolute carnage that will follow.  Ahh good ol' childhood memories of bloodshed and watching battlefields littered with corpses rot away and leave nothing but skeletons and armour everywhere. Amazing how this game still holds up beautifully to this date, still incredibly addictive and entertaining to no end. Staple franchise that introduced thousands into the RTS genre back in the 90's.  Great introductory game to the genre of RTS or even for more hardcore players. Some of the battles can leave whole stretches of maps full of corpses and wrecked wooden vehicles."
Literally the best game ever
""
Great strategy game
"This game is very nostalgic to me, I usually love old RTS games like Warcraft and Command &amp; Conquer, But this HD renewal is simply amazing! the only problems in the game are the bugs and a few game crashes on The Forgotten missions, But still the game is AWESOME :)."
"I never got around to playing any of the games after 'Rise of Rome', so I was pleasantly surprised to find not much has changed."
"It's an HD remake of a classic game, what more needs to be said? It plays just like the original AoE 2, but with better graphics that are kind of hard to tell the difference in some cases, but overall it's a great game and worth the money to buy it. Definitely fun at LAN parties with a bunch of friends playing together."
This game is a classic.
"I can't stand RTS games. With that said, this is the only one that has ever had me playing for hours after hours. Every RTS game I own, is because I want another game just as amazing as this one."
"A redoing of one of the most prolific RTS's in history is a delicate process. I do notice a small difference in graphics, but it is something as seemingly insignificant as raising the pop cap from 200 to 500 that really wows me on the re-release. It's a fantastic game and the lost kingdoms dlc is fantastic and well-fitted. There is few games that I like to play multiplayer as much as this. I'd give it a 9/10."
"When this game first came out I loved it. Now it is even better with improved graphics and an added expansion. One game, two extra expansions that add just as much gameplay is totally worth the cheap price. Also the graphics dont look like a game that has been out almost ten years now."
I only recommend this to people who loved Age of Empires 2. It's exactly the same game. Pass on this if you never played it before or if you're a hardcore RTS fan (which you've probably played this if you are.)
Great Game period.
"Great LAN game for up to 8 friends.  Campaign is dated sadly, but still a fantastic game.  Visuals are nicely ramped up since last release.   Worth it? Yes, only if you intend to play with friends lanning/online however. Otherwise the game is about 10 years too old to be bought just for solo play."
Fantastic mix of RTS and history.
A great game to play with a friend/someone you intend to backstab.
"Played all the AoE games over the years. The AoE franchise has always put out good games...figured I would get this on sale with The Forgotten saga and see how the scenarios were...Not bad, the graphics are nice. People put out maps in the workshop. But I have not downloaded any yet. "
"This is an amazing game and has stood the test of time, outclassing it's own successor. Since I bought this in 1999 (I think), I keep coming back to it, despite pulls from subsequent releases (AOE 3, C&amp;C x tons, etc).  The graphics are a little dated and the HD version really doesn't add much to the experience but there is so much to do and achieve that I still think I'll be playing it in 40-50 years (it'll definitely outlive me)!"
"It's purely old days, you will love this if you spend time at the old good AoE games. Online is crowded aswell..."
Classic game!I picked it up recently and found it still bring me so much fun.
Enjoyed playing the game again..it was nice to be able to play in 1080. The only down-side is that it seems like they cut out the ability to play a LAN multiplayer game...
"The best real time strategy game i've ever played - even played it as a child. I know it since the official release in the late 1990's. The battles in this game are awesome, you've got a lot of units and i promiss, it won't get boring. There are a lot of campaigns with great stories where you can learn a bit about the Middle Ages.  Get it! ;-)"
love this game!
"Probably the best strategy game ever made. The controls aren't as easy to use as newer games like starcraft 2, but the gameplay is amazing. Glad to see they made a version that runs on never versions of windows and with texture packs and active online mode!"
Classic strategy game.  I love a game that lets me choose who I am and reap the rewards of that decision. Like Byzantinian walls.
"Really fun game compatible with all the current operating systems Vista-Windows 8. My only gripe is that being listed as a HD edition I would have expected smoother graphics, but otherwise the game is great and highly recommended."
"Amazing! They made eveything awesome! Love it! Just buy it, you wont regret it!"
Great Game. Better than AOE3. Pop limit of 500 makes it even better. Love how you can create your own map and create a high resource map to make the battles more serious.
This was one of the very first pc games I played constantly. I still have the old cd pack. Probably wasted 300+ hours on this game. It is very addicting. This is the game that probably got me hooked on MOBA's. A well rounded game with a nice campaign. Lots of solo replay value.
One of the best RTS games ever! The remake finnaly runs on Windows Vista and later.
"Now here's a blast from the past. I first played this game years ago, and I was far too young and impatient to bother with RTS games back then... yet for some reason I'd keep playing this game regardless.   It has a certain charm about it, and with the HD upgrades and the ease of multiplayer these days, it's a must purchase if you're an RTS fan and have friends to play along with!"
Good Remake of a Good Game
"A great game. If you never played it when it came out, definitely check it out now."
"This game really takes me back. I used to play games like AOE and Rise of Nations with my friends in highschool all the time, and it never got old. And the best part is that it doesn't just teach you strategy; it teaches you history as well (maybe not that much, but it's got some interesting stuff). I think the best part about it is that you don't even have to be a really skilled player to enjoy it (God knows I'm not the best). To can playtest endless different strategies against the AI nations in preparation for a game against your friends, and if that strategy didn't work, you can tweak 'till it's perfect. All in all, a pretty solid game. Even if the units per boat don't make any sense."
This game needs no real introduction. It's a classic 4X game that's on Steam now. Buy it.
Really fun. Great for playing with friends and just campaigning alone
"The only reason to play Age of Empires II is because its the second greatest strategy game of all time. I would say its the greatest strategy game of all time, but I'm prevented by the sheer fact that 'wololo' is the greatest unit sound ever.  So far I've had only a few bugs and the terrible graphical 'improvements' like the new farm textures can be fixed easily thanks to steam workshop."
One of the greatest RTS games EVER!
"Reminds me of the good old days. This is pretty much the same game as the original (Which is a good thing), but the multiplayer actually works!"
Classic game remastered. Cant say anything bad about it
Great game that I haven't played since I was like ten..
A HD remake for the old AOE 2 so you know it's going to be amazing
"For those of you who were irked by the poor lan multiplayer and very limiting population cap, this game will definitely make your day."
"This is one of my favourite RTS games of all time. The varied races, all with unique technologies coupled with the robust map editor has created some truly addictive game modes. Youtube Castle Blood if you want to know what's up."
"Very challenging game, but it is very fun too kill some extra time you have."
"If you dont own AoE2, then its time you should."
Its nice
Definitely the best strategy game out there!
this is the game that kick started my love for RTS games also was the first game i ever played. the peautiful sound of hundreds of knights and soldiers steamrolling towards a helpless cowards base still rings in my ears and takes me back to when i first played this.i never gave a game a full rating in my life but...this one is an exception.yes its an old game (its from the 90s) but it will live on as a legend.BEST..GAME..EVER  10/10-Pootis the Communist Pyro
"yeah its pretty good, been playing it since i was 4 with age of empires 1 being one of my first games, would get on steam aye"
I got the game when it first came out and remember going to my grandma's to play the very first one. I'm glad they have finally come out with an expansion.
Old school gaming. Everything is exactly the same. Just better colors. Couldn't ask for more.
It's so gud
brings back memories
"Its no game mechanics change, only better graphics and propper 1080p support."
"Very happy about it. Do not expect it to be a new version with innovative features and whatnot, it's just an HD reissue. But if you loved it back then, you'll love it now, nicely playable on high resolutions and with the ease of steam multiplayer integration. All the stability and crash problems mentioned in old reviews have been patched out!"
Awesome classic strategy game. Highly reccomend it.
this game is the bomb digigty 
Classic. What else do you want?
Still as fun as you remember. One of the few games that easily stands the test of time.
"excellent strategy game, one classic master piece, if you wanna try this game, you better do it, you will not regret it"
Great classic.
"wololololo this game is the dankest shieeiiet, and i haven't even played it yet"
"Great fun, especially with friends. A classic from 1999"
"Awesome game! I love it! Monk , i need a monk!"
This game is a good game.
Wars better if you wage it in HD.
"Age of Empires II has always been my favorite medieval strategy game and it continues to be. It is so great that the developers have breathed new life into a classic. I have always loved the simplicity of the game, how it not as complicated as Total War. The improved graphics and gameplay are awesome and the new civilizations and maps are just amazing. The expanded map and population size and brings up to par with todays games. The achievements and multiplayer will have you playing for days on end. A must buy. It is a truly phenomenal game."
Sick game you should buy it. I have the original and its so good.
"Brings back the nostalgic feeling of age of empire, Missed it and since the game have the same textures it looks the same and feels the same. Wonderfull!"
"A great remake of an old game. Age of Empires 2 was probably the highpoint of the series for me. Stability can be an issue, but crashes are few and far between. There aren't many RTS games like this anymore, and with the free-to-play model ruining the genre, this is a welcome comeback. If anyone wants to play a RTS from their golden age, AoE 2 HD is definatly worth the price."
great game still don't get the forgotten pack it wrecks alot of the fun map styles
"Does not fit to today's standards, even in HD"
"The most innovative rts game back when it was released. Seeing it in HD is the best revisit to a game I ever had.  Here is the recipe for a lot of fun for complete new people: Join (find people with low rating (1500 or less) or create a game Pick a civ you like select a team click ready Start the game/Wait for game to start Start building your empire - most of building placements are quite intuitive. Build an army  Crush your enemies   Whether newbie, casual or going pro In an RTS game its important to understand what you want to get out of the game and what is needed to get there. Here is an example of what i think makes a great RTS game:  MAPS - Oh the maps. Imagine you play a game and by changing the map the game takes a completely different turn in strategies. As always in RTS there is a balancing act between making army, buildings or expanding economy, the maps in AoE have some of best game changing maps ever imagined. Here goes:  Arabia - an open map nothing is safe favors rushing, fast units and resource defense (a typical map type for rts games)  Black Forest - A vast forest map with narrow passages (easily walled) provides for long games - typical favored by newer players, but remains a classic sometimes.   Water maps - a new economy is rising! Fishing is the new farming and you have to defend your fleet of fishing boats while destroying the eco of the enemy. Honorable mention here is the Team island map where each team has a seperate island where the fight on water typically has the motive to clear a spot on the enemy island to set up shop and start raiding parties for the win.  Extra resourcefull maps - hate farms ? Try yucatan it has more turkey and deer that will prolong the transisition to farming and cater for new rush strategies with certain civs like mongols (faster hunting) and britons (faster turkey harvest)  NOMAD - In nomad maps you start with just villagers and no base, like everyone else. It means technology is set far back and any early advantage of finding resources or killing enemies before they complete their base can spiral completely out of control. One of my favourite map choices is random Land Nomad. Its basically like you get an extra era of your civilization.     Casuals are favored in AoE because the rather easy to learn mechanics of the game (i.e. gentle learning curve) and multiplayer friendly environment, strong defensive tools like walls and castles.   For the newbies and visitors (extremely casual) its a sweet game, with nice built campaign, ability to reduce game speed and enjoy the clash of 400 units pounding at each other, with old warmachines, soldiers and archers with a full battle formation system that is sometimes game changing when used correctly.   For the serious people (pros and alike), AoE offers more features then any other RTS that i have met to date - 10 years ago as well :) To mention a few:   BALANCE - the civs all have distinct advantages thus balance is quite unclear, when played perfectly some civilizations come ahead of others in different stages of the games.   MECHANICS - In order to play a perfect game there a few factors to include, first of all you need to master hotkeys to perfection (which are fully customizable to your own RTS fingers), secondly techniques such as microing villagers (for chopping and hunting) is very important, battle formations are still useful as they become a tool to dodge enemy fire. Battle microing changes as ballistics are being researched. Constructing buildings to interlink them and form walls and section your empire becomes an important skill toi have :) Any many more things.   METAGAME - Unlike some other games (Hi Starcraft 1, 2) this game has hard counters, pikemen vs knights is one of the obvious ones. There are many build orders out there, but at some point in higher levels of play it becomes more important to react and anticipate rather than follow some strict build orders. Multiplayer metagame, is somewhat balanced but here the Team bonus from civilizations commands certain civs to be taken on selected maps.   And there are many more good parts of the game which is why I dont think there will ever be a better RTS game, UNLESS they fix lag issues.Thats right - this game still gets 100% score in my world but here comes the bad things:  GAMING PLATFORM - the multiplayer platforms in games have evolved greatly since AoE was first released, the network stability, the lag, the slowing of the game. In AoE lag can be a severe issue, dragging the game long without any need. Also the desync happens from time to time that will destroy any match that was started. Perhaps one day it will be fixed, lets all hope.   I love this game, and if you like RTS games so will you - Im willing to bet.   C3r3brum         "
Still one of the best games around.
"Let's party like in 1999! It's the best part of the series, now in HD.  Back in 1999 it was the best real time strategy game to date. After it came Age of Mythology and Empire Earth series, which were good, but still not that good as AoE.  Every civilization comes with its unique units and abilities, units are well balanced, and you have to really think and plan ahead your actions. Every unit is good against specific type of units (siege, cavalry etc.) and weak against another, so you cannot just build bazzilion of men at arms and rush at your oponnent, as you will be annihilated by couple of catapults.   If you have original version of AoE 2 - wait for a promo, and get it, if not - it's an insta-buy!  Pros - Good old Age of Empires 2 - Steam workshop with many many mods  Cons - Cliff textures are just awful - Still poor AI - Not fixed pathfinding issues"
One of the best RTS's ever made. Ever. Incredibly siumple to play incredibly hard to master. If you don't own this game buy it now.
Glad they brought this back! Steam Workshop is awesome!
Still Fun 10 years later
A game from my childhood brought back to life in HD and with a new online server. Absolutely fantastic and worth hours upon hours of playtime.
Good old AoE II. How can you not recommend it?
this gam is the finest in fine town it gets me errect whenevr i play with it 11/14
there is nothing to be said to explain how awsome this game is
"7.5/10 'Good' (Because of 'HD' missing parts, base game is 9/10) Age Of Empires II is a great strategic game that focuses on much more than just combat. The campaigns are a pretty good adventure, but the real fun is skirmish matches! Whether your facing an A.I. opponent or in a PVP session, the game really shines out from the rest. I love how long matches last in the game (around 2 hours) and provokes you to make important strategic decisions at every turn! 'Should I advance my naval warfare, or my infantry? Should I use my food to advance to the next age, or should I get more workers?'. The game itself is outstanding, but the 'HD' part of the game, isn't much to show for. The 'HD' edtion does add 'Steam Workshop', and better video options and such, but the games graphics and UI are still the same, dont get me wrong it doesnt bring down the game at all, but a graphical reboot, and customizeable UI, ect., could've made it beyond what it was before. Lazy 'HD' release, but such a damn gem of a game! GET THIS GAME!"
"I am posting a review so I can be a pillar of the community. This is a great game, though."
"Its no game mechanics change, only better graphics and propper 1080p support."
"Very happy about it. Do not expect it to be a new version with innovative features and whatnot, it's just an HD reissue. But if you loved it back then, you'll love it now, nicely playable on high resolutions and with the ease of steam multiplayer integration. All the stability and crash problems mentioned in old reviews have been patched out!"
A really awesome game check it out 
AOEII ! It's one of the best games of all time.
"If you ever liked AoE then you will be extremely happy that they have now released an HD edition, which is playable with Windows 7. So now we can play on our high end gaming PC a game that I thought I would only be able to play on my old clunker of a computer. Thank you:)"
Fun classic game that you'll always end up playing every now and then. Happy with this HD release as my old original version was no longer playable with windows 7.
the best strategy game I had ever played..
"Age of Empires II HD is a solid RTS that could very well be the high point of its series, other than Age of Mythology. It isn't as accessible as Age of Empires III, but is still very accessible nonetheless and very well is worth your time."
"Retro 1990's game where you build your civilisation up using villagers to gather resources food, wood, gold and stone. Advancing through ages is fun, but the fights along the way more so!   Played this about 13 years ago, then came back to it in 2010 and enjoyed it as much as i did back in the days!! TImeless game you have to own. Personally owned AOE II HD for 2 weeks and played 40+ hours!"
Old school game but never gets too old. If you are an Age of Empires series fan then you must get this.
"Definatley worth it Age of empires II was and still is the perfect medieval strategy game, and after many years a patch is included!"
"I remember playing this game as a kid with my Grandad, such a hit of Nostalgia and the multiplayer means I can play with my buddies. Not Bad :3"
Nothing changed but HD graphics r nice..
"Fantastic game, it's just like the old one, but HD."
"So much nostalgia. Just like I remembered, and that's a good thing. Next step: multiplayer via Steam, which will fix my one negative memory about this game - dealing with LAN connections."
"This game is amzing! Very addicting, very fun, up to 8 players multiplayer or battle with AI, this game has it all and with so many civilitations to choose from the DLC 'the forgoten' the game is endless! Now if only steam had Age of Mythology. Mabey one day."
Such a great game! Highly recommended.
"One of my favorite RTS games. If you've played Total War, or Starcraft, or any other good RTS, you will love Age of Empires."
dont play this game
Great game. Soo much better then the original. DLCS rock. 10/10 and a game everyone needs to get.
"AAAAAAAAAAH HA HA HA HA COWER PEASANTS BEFORE MY MIGHTY ARCHER ELEPHANTS!!!   Besides my maniacal tendancies in the game, it's quite fun and is strategically yes... take that as you will."
Very very awesome game if you like strategy and base razing.
"A remake done right, love this game, my favourite RTS of all time."
"As I have played the original, I definitely recommend the HD remake if you are willing to pay for the game again. I was hesitant of paying for a game I already owned and would have liked to just register a CD key and get the game on Steam but it went on a decent sale and I bought it. I was enjoying the great game play of a great game I experienced long ago and with better and new features at that. The features that I like the most is a working multiplayer and steamworkshop integration. The workshop and multiplayer really brings the community together and enjoy a classic RTS."
One of the best RTS games ever made.  Play the challenging and accurate historical campaigns or go for competitive play Online against others. The game has everything a good RTS needs.  A game that teaches history..  9/10
"nostalgica. Its still a great game but the full price is stupid. I really love the game, and that will never change. the graffics are far from hd, they have just made them compatibal for newer grafficscards."
Epic fun and cool game I love playing it ! Worth every cent!
"(It may say I have like 3 hours on record here, but that's because I used to play this long before Steam even existed. Realistically, it should probably be like 1000 hours.)  It's one of the best RTS's of all time. At long last upgraded to HD and brought to Steam and full proper functionality. The fact that there's a new expansion DLC for it after 10 years is pretty fantastic too."
"A fantastic game for its age, highly recommended! (And nostalgia up to your ears if you played it when younger)"
"No h8, I r8 8 on 8 m8s because this game is gr8"
"Great for Nostalgia, stands up well against modern titles!"
"Been playing the original AoE 2 for 8 years, this HD remake is really sweet."
"Ah, Age of Empires II -- the same classic game I played years and years ago, and will (hopefully) continue to play in the years to come because it never goes out of style. Overall, it's an excellent RTS game. I'll try to sum up its major features.   NOTE: I strictly play the singleplayer so I won't refer at all to the multiplayer.   PROS: --High replayability --Depending upon difficulty, the game can be quite a challenge. If you set it to very difficult and begin a deathmatch, for example, expect an enemy to come knocking within the first ten minutes with an adequately equipped army. Of course, you're probably still in that necessary stage where you're training enough villagers to begin harvesting supplies, but... you know.  --Even in HD, the graphics are a little outdated, but still good even 10+ years after release. Units and buildings are moderately detailed. If you really don't like the graphics, there are mods to fix that. --the soundtrack, sound effects, and voice-acting for the campaigns is excellent and immersive, sometimes even a little amusing (the Mongol accents are admittedly funny in my opinion).  --Gameplay mechanics are fluid and sound; rather than an entire unit, you recruit units one by one with a population cap normally at 75. Of course, you can change population cap to 200 prior to starting a deathmatch, but this can get very messy very quickly. There are two singleplayer game modes, campaign (all of which follow historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Joan of Arc, etc.) and deathmatch, which is possibly the most important feature in terms of replayability - there are many options for maps, opponents, population cap, victory conditions, etc.  CONS: --the AI can be frustrating at times. Your units will normally travel in formation, but when they accidentally run into each other, the game freaks out a little. By this, I mean one unit will strangely freeze and only begin to move again once the offending unit has moved on. Moreover, sometimes one unit or two will decide NOT to travel in formation, riding ahead by itself / themselves into ambushes. Always fun. The enemy AI, however, is freakishly all-knowing. Normally sends a scout out to discover the map and will continue to use this scout for the duration of the game, preventing you from hiding any buildings later on because they WILL find you and they WILL kill you, Liam Neeson-style.   THE VERDICT: Overall, it's an excellent game for fans of RTS, especially at its relatively low cost (compared to the Total War games, for example). Easily scores a 9.8/10 for me. I highly recommend it. :)"
"Grew up playing this game when it first came out. It kept me playing for hours and hours, even if I created my own map and just destroyed all of my allies for 'teh lulz.'  Anyone can play this if they play through the tutorial just to get a feel of how to control, build, etc. I'm very impressed with the HD remake."
"I have played this game since it first came out in Oct 1999. Watched the old multiplayer quit in 2006, and have lived to see the game get re-vamped beautifully. This RTS is one of the best out there, and it really defined many that came after it. If you are a RTS gamer, this is a mush have."
This new revises version of AOE is more than I expected. its great! 
One of the best games eve made been a fan since i was a kid I loved every AOE game and will alwasy highly recommend it =)
"if you liked age2 definitley get this for the multiplayer, oh and the higher resolution is nice too"
"It's great but it's the exact same as the original AoE II. The only difference is that multiplayer now works. Great fun but if you already own the original, there's no need to buy this one"
"If you like real time strategies you can't go wrong with this game. I have played age of empires 1 and 3 as well but 2 is by far my favorite, this may just be me being nostalgic for it but it is a lot of fun."
After only about three hours of playtime I can already see the improvements made to this game. The graphics were beautifully redone and the AI is vastly improved.
"This game is pure nostalgia, if you never played it before it might be difficult to enjoy. It hasn't aged all that well but its still very fun especially the multiplayer. Get it right now while its on sale if you mean to."
Played since I was about 7 or 8 and still love to play it especially againist other people online were every person fights differently unless you play the deathmatch gamemode. LOL
it blows pp
"This game is my child hood, it's just like I remember it. It is a fun game for just doing random stuff and its more fuin with cheats. The campaign is also really fun."
So many memories playing the game. HD version just adds to the fun
An old friend and now on steam lots of play time to come.
Will forever be one of my favorite games.
This is a review. To tell you what you all already know. AOE II is one of the best games in creation. The HD part is just a bonus and is pretty awesome. This is all.
"A classic that never gets boring. Love building a nice town and protect it with walls, gates and towers. Military units walking in different formations is so awesome to see."
Just as good as the original version!
"love the game, played it when i was young, and willl continue to play it."
Playing AOE2 HD I'm back in my 18th and it's fantastic comback ;-).
If you have never played Age of Empires you have no reason to not buys this game....  If you have already played Age of Empires whay are you even reading this?  
Nice job with the resolution!
"This game is basicly the first comming of civ. Woth it, you wont regret buying this amazing work of the gods."
"Great game, buy."
Great game. Brings back memories from my beginnings in the RTS world. I would tell anyone to pick up this game for the price tag on it and see where it all began.
This game is a classic. Will forever love this game. It still to this day is a game i come back to. Must have.
"Classic game, Can't beat it :)"
Great game. Very fun.
"Very good game, can get frustrating and challenging at times but it presents a good challenge and is an incredibly good game."
"Delicious game, well worth the whatever amount of money."
"As an old man, I remember playing Age of Empires 2 when it first came out. I remember having to put CDs in, installing it, buying the expansion pack later. This is one of thie quintessencial strategy games to own. This can be held in the same regard as Warcraft, Starcraft, and Command &amp; Conquer. If you're a turn-based strategy fan who loves Civilization and Heroes of Might &amp; Magic, I would highly suggest picking this up as well. This is not high fantasy, but when you have the Japanese and Egyptians going toe-to-toe over the Americas, what is real anyways? I give this game a total thumbs up and something I hope gets you to love this game as I used to."
The best.
Epic ♥♥♥♥in game. Its the old age of empires 2 with updated graphics and actual SERVERS. Played by hundreds of users daily and can very quickly get into games. Was so popular made an expansion for it -- even though this game is over 15 years old. :p
"Always have a great love for this game! buy it try it out for yourself , its old game but its great!!"
pretty amazing better than all other aoe games
This is a classic game and the remake with the Forgotten has made it even better.
What I played before Total War :P
"Fun game, exactly how i remmeber."
This is the best gme inthe whole world since 1st ever released. I have played this game since 1999 at least. I love to make maps. Fun war game.
"I remember this game as one of the best games of my childhood. When i noticed it came in HD and just the fact it came on steam, i bought it straight away, i was afraid i wasn't going to be the same, but it is, and its amazing. I love it :)"
"A good game, I like to play it, it is good to play. Also I like it."
awesome classic strategy game
If you like RTS you will love this game. You are able to play with a lot of different variables.
"Age of Empires II HD is awesome. It's everything you remember about it as a child and more. With Full screen resolution, and Steam Workshop integration (And all the awesome mods from the community) Age of Empires II HD is looking better than ever. The developers of the game have increased the population limit and map size. This means bigger and better, tougher and more tactical battles.  Multiplayer has also been made easier with an in game lobby browser, and for those who like to share gameplay there's TwitchTV integration!  Great classic game, made even better.   "
Great Game. Hours upon hours spent playing with friends. Would recommend to anyone who likes these types of games.
This game is just the game.
old game but still a nice one nice graphics 
I loved it then and I love it now. Damn good multiplayer and the new expansion is killer. 9/10
"Just like the original Age of Empires II, but better."
Classics are the best especially age of empires 2. In my top 5 games. :)
Yololo
"Classic RTS, Nostalgia at it's finest... It's HD!. 10/10!"
"This game is a classic in every sense of the word. I am elated that Microsoft dusted this game off, gave it a new coat of paint and integrated it into Steam. I hope this game is always available to play on modern PC's because there hasn't been anything like it in the RTS space since."
"Love this game, the reboot is amazing. Teaches an old dog some new trickss"
"A classic, great game, but a complete technical failure. If your re-release of a 15 year old game drops to 5 fps on a modern gaming pc, you have failed. Works okay on land maps but completely unplayable on water maps with all graphically options down. Not worth your money."
A good game especially if you love strategic games like civ 5.
"Just as good as I remember! Plus the cheats still work, and everyone loves the monkey head!"
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY GAME IT'S GOOD.
"This was easily one of the greatest games I played. It was entertaining, challenging, and funny all at the same time. It's a must for people to play."
the good classic game i remeber playing before
"My old school and best Strategy game ever made! As everyone knows AoE2 and knows that there's no other game can compete this game, still love this game and wanna play it more, but actually there's a problem... The problem is year 2014, all other games have much better quality witch makes you can't enjoy this game like you was back then! without relizing you will get bored only because of the old quality, but....  Remake! AoE remake with the current generation will be great! Since the game release i haven't play better Strategy game than AoE. Afterall it's nice to add new content to this game and make it live again, still so recommended."
Definitely brings back the late night fun of playing with friends again without the hassel of figuring out IP addresses and port forwarding!
Classic.
One of my favorite games ever. Nothing better then watching a group of War Elephants destroy a city
"UPDATE: Many of the previously mentioned bugs seem to be resolved. Changing my review to be positive, as it's quite nice to be able to play AOE2 again. /UPDATE  Serious buyer's remorse on this one. I adored AOE2 in college,and was hoping to play it again just like how I remembered (no new fancy hoo-dads or whatever; just prettier), but very serious (and well-documented) bugs cripple the playability of this version of the game.  They may patch it out, but that's what they said before I bought it, too. Pass this one by and stick with the old-school version of it you can find it."
It's excellent the 2nd time around. Holds up well and doesn't try to excuse itself from the core elements of an RTS like its more modern counterparts.
"(10/10) Yea I like it, just as much as i did back in the old days. The new 'expansion' plus Workshop just makes it even greater!"
Not as cool as Civ. But still good
It's the same exact game at a higher resolution. If that's what you want then that's what you get. I for one still dig it.
"Amazing game. I used to play this as a kid and it definitely brought back the old memories, It's definitely the game you want to play if you aren't big into RTS games and would like to learn."
"Its Age of Empires 2 in HD. I mean come on, just buy it already."
"The classic AoE II, but it looks better. A lovely purchase, if you ask me."
"sick game, dont think anyone could ever ask anymore!"
I have only played this game 9 Hrs(steam want offline so it only says 5 on my acount) i have thoughorly enjoyed it and have recomended this game to 6 of my friends.  I have only had this hame 1 day and it is one of the best games i have ever played
"One of the greatest games I've grown up with, absolutley love the multiplayer aspect of it. Best with Friends!"
"This game is really fun, and although I am terrible at it, I have a decent amount of enjoyment losing the the AI bots."
The taste of my childhood... in HD. It's worth it.
Good Game to play single player...
Age of Empires 2 was an absolutly brilliant game and when it came out it set the tone on how RTS's were meant to be done. Few games even come close to this and even now it remains one of the best RTS in existance.
"Great Game obviously, though there has to be an update soon, in which the serious multiplayer flaws get dealt with."
"We all love it when the classics of our childhood end up on Steam.  Age of Empires II in HD. No longer do flaming buildings look like buildings with paper flames pasted on them. The graphics are better, and the DLC has new civilizations."
"This remastered version of Age of Empires is great if you played it before it was available on steam. New players may have a hard time with multiplayer because it's very skill based, so noobs don't have a good shot at winning games. If you're a big time RTS person though you could still pick it up and give it a shot. If you read guides, play a lot of single player, and watch games, you could be good enough to find multiplayer enjoyable. In general this game is a lot less complicated than games like Civ, but rich enough to give room for lots of strategies and fun. Games can last hours, but seem really fast paced to me. The biggest advantage to having this game on steam is the ease of multiplayer. The original is over 10 years old, so the multiplayer with that is real shotty and hard to do sometimes. Steam makes it a lot easier to make a lobby and play with friends, but playing with random people is normally an issue because the anonymous multiplayer is normally kind of dead. Other than making the multiplayer a bit better through steam, the next best thing is the game runs good in modern operating systems which used to be a problem for me with the old one. A last big plus is the steam workshop. Other than those things, the HD reboot is really not that different than the original. The graphics are hardly different/better compared to the ancient original, but you can download good texture packs in the workshop. Multiplayer through steam still has some issures. TLDR: Pick it up if you're a fan of the series or a big RTS fan."
THE GREATEST ♥♥♥♥ING COMPUTER GAME OF THE 90S
A timesink that I've lost days into.
"I like this version of Age of Empires the best. It pretty much forces you to develop your civilization a bit before the 'big battle' that eventually ends the game. So, it is fun just to play with friends, even if you don't win in the end."
Fun game for old school gamers
"Definitely a fun time, custom maps are a lot of fun to play/make."
"Age of Empires II, still a great classic after all these years. Oddly addicting, it will make the time go by fast."
"Ah, yes, Age of Empires II. This was my introduction to PC gaming so you could imagine my joy at hearing that they remastered this for Steam. This game, I believe, is one of the best RTS games I have ever played, period. The game is wonderfully balanced and great fun alone or with a group of friends. The single player campaigns are rather fun and tell a compelling narrative with the historical backdrop. I would recommend this game to anyone."
"One of the greatest RTS, now redone! Still one of my top played over my lifetime."
Great game
So nice to be able to play this again!
Good old school RTS. Glad it came back.
"Ever since the latest update, updateing the game to version 3.6F I keep getting disconnected when in multiplayer game play!!!! This totally sucks, FIX PLEASE!!! This was never happening to me before.  "
Best game ever can keep me busy all day once I start playing
Time travel IS possible! Just start playing this game and watch hours pass in the blink of an eye.
"Don’t let the 2D graphics fool you, this is probably the best game revival of all time. It was very popular when the original game was released in 1999, and still is today. AOE II HD Edition has many new things to offer, I especially like the widescreen options and achievements system. Even now, the campaigns are well worth your time and multiplayer is better than ever. I play on a 3 screen setup (fun, but NOT required) and the game easily stretches to my desired resolution. The achievements always have me aiming for goals and trying new things in-game. I would highly recommend this game to people who like strategy and city building or to anyone with a low powered PC (2D graphics don’t take much). So buy it now and START THE GAME ALREADY!"
"An oldie but a goodie. I remeber when I started playing this in 98, and I still can't help play it from time to time to this day. I almost stopped playing the original version of this game due to compatibility issues. Now that this is seeing suport again I am back to spending way too much time with this game. I also love the fact that the custom scenarios are seein alot of releases from the steam workshop. The scenario ediotr used to be almost useless, but now there are all sorts of custom scenarios available. If you get a chance, downoad the tower defence scenario.   Love this game. Thank you Steam and Microsoft for brining this game back to life."
"A timeless, classic RTS that provides that time-sucking, mouse-clicking, strategic fun. This game made me look at my clock at 10pm, then five minutes later, it was 4 in the morning. If you like the classic RTS style of gameplay combined with tons of variety in your choices, then this game is for you 5/5."
once played with Exlyon 11/10
"I don't have anything to say, only it is the best game ever"
Been playing this game for around 12 years from AOE. This new upgrade blew me away and put me right back since I only play the computer! I have had to go back to the beginners stage just to try and finish a game. Got the shock of my life to see ships attacking from all sides (nomad game regicide) while I am still in feudal age. The computer is cheating big time and I considered myself a good player!!! AI has superceded everything...they have armies of at least 50 assorted coming from all angles...from a pop of 125??? I have yet to see them fight each other - all just coming at me and my ally. Hello...huge computer cheats...and this is on standard - got totally wiped out in my usual moderate in early stages....too aggressive too soon??? I love the game but this has turned into a really hard game at the easiest levels almost. I used to play online but got sick of being wiped out by say 30 onagers at once coming all sides without actually strategy being used...just a bit bewildered by such a dramatic overall change to the game...
"Having recently reinstalled AOE HD including the latest patch I find it impossible to play even on easy difficulty, what used to be a very enjoyable and relaxing experience has now become a waste of time. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times over the past two days and no matter which game mode I play I am defeated every time, I am no stranger to AOE and have played on and off for many years, I will now seek to find my enjoyment elsewhere and AOE will be filed away never to be played again."
"Good game overall, better if playing with humans because bots tend to resign for the slightest of things, including being scouted."
Its awesome
"This Game is a classic gem. Been playing the original since i was 6 and now i bought this version to be able to play online w/ my friends and family w/o needing the same internet to play. if you are a fan of the original you'll definantly like this remake. If you are new and enjoy stategy games i definantly recommed this game. the only problem is the multiplayer online, it can be a bit laggy at times but other than that ive havent had many problems with the game. the price is a bit pricy if you have the original game, i'll admit i was a bit hesitant to buy it at full price so i just waited for a steam sale to finally pick it up. The game is still as great as the original and now with the improvments and expansion its even better than before and i'm quite happy with the improvments."
One of the best games of the last millenium remastered!
"This game just blows my mind. I've been playing the age of empires series ever since the first one and I got to say their all amazing. I had lost my previous AOE II disc so I had to go and buy another one anyway. But right on time this came and and I immediately bought it. This was the game of my childhood and I still get 100's of hours out of the series. My favorite will have to be the third game due to the fact that the units are well balanced. For example, in AOE II there is a Spanish civi. The spanish have a Conquistidor units that does 17 damage, it weilds a gun so it is also on horseback. A normal Knight fully upgraded only does 12 in the castle age, and hes on horseback too! Don't get me started on the persians. 600 Health, 20+ damage, no range (thank god) , and their reletivly slow. (Their War Elephants) Other then the Spanish, Turks, and Persians, their all well balanced. Except the longbowmen, in the imperial age they can have 12 range. But that takes some time to get to. Anyways, enough of my rant. This game overall is good and its a slight upgrade from the last with the easier online play and workshop. If you already own this game is it worth it? Absolutely not. Their are hardly any improvments in graphics, LAN was taken away, AI still remains broken in some aspects. (Don't get me wrong the AI is great, just in some cases when their stuck between other vilies or take a long route when clearly they can just take the short route, it can get anoyying) This is pretty much a resell to people who already own it. Its practically the same thing for 20$ more. Would I recomend this to a person who doesn't have it? Definetly, this game is well rounded and with enough time on your hands you can gets 100's gameplay hours out of it. I haven't hit 100 on steam, yet. BUt I definetly have over a thousand outside of steam. Total Score 9.2 Out Of 10.0"
Great game :) shame im not too good at it haha
A awesome game of harvesting recourses to make a huge base and army to overwhelm your enemys! Definatley worth your money!
this game is incredible? maybe? i think so?
""
8/10. Expected more HD'ness. Still good though.
So addictive and fun. +100000000000000 you should buy.
"I waited for YEARS for this to happen, and now that it has, I almost can't believe it. It brings back all the countless hours of fun I've enjoyed thanks to the great minds from good ol' Ensemble. The companies who worked to remake it did a great job, and even added a few tweeks of their own, which enhanced it in my opinion. It can overtax your system though, with the new largest map and 500 pop. cap., but it still runs great. All in all, its a very good remake, and is worth paying for."
"Great game, Well worth it."
Great game. Really brings back a lot of memories for those who had played this game before.
"AOE back in HD, I've played the original one since day 1 and this has brought back lots of great memories. Make sure you have good internet connection for online play other than that any computer can run this. Definitely worth it for any RTS fan or player. ENJOY!"
"Age of empires hp the forgotten is a very nice game but the path finding of your units isnt that good when you click on the map the units just run around or get stuck and dont run the fastest route, if they get stuck they dont move any furher and it is very frustrating hope they can make an update to fix that"
BEST game ever  :wololo:
Wonderful. Simply wonderful. The age shows nevertheless (pun!)
This is an amazing remake of one of the best RTS games in all history. I can remember loosing my childhood over the amazing funness of this game. Never stop playing it! Get a group of friends together and just go!
"If you dont know what this is by now, go play angry birds. Its the old game verbatim with the ability to upscale and they've even added an expansion pack like 20 years after the game came out. Kinda nuts. This game probably isnt for this latest generation but still worth a try. I only bought and am reviewing this because its a fantastic game and always was. Now I just get to buy it again. Sincerely,   http://www.thecomic-community.com "
"It's as good as I remembered it to be. I spent so many hours playing this gem when I was little and I believe it will still continue to entertain for a long while, especially with Steam workshop integration!"
One of the best RTS games ever.
"Well...I was hoping a bigger enhacement, that's for sure. If you are hoping to see great change, don't buy it. If you like to have old games from your childhood and you really, really like this game, go for it.   I like the game, which remains the same in escence and has more possibilities regarding multiplayer and Steam community.   It is a classic and that's the real value it has.   Cheers!"
It's a great rts
"Truly the most nostalgic RTS ever, and it's HD!!"
Great strategy game!!!
Fun to play if you have friends but if not stick to CoD.
"Is AoE II HD worth it? absolutely!! Brings back so much nostalgia of playing the game when I was younger, with updated graphics and a nice raised pop cap. So much fun and stays quite true to the original. Definitely worth it."
Multiplayer almost unplayable
This game is very fun especially with friends.
It's not really HD but its fokken good mmm'kaaay?
My entire village was razed by a wild boar.     11/10
Classic.
really well done. same game just better. kind of sucks that the new content dont run as fast as it should. turned off 3d water and that helped with lagging. 8/10
Its great fun
"Age of Empires II was literally the gateway game to all strategy games I've ever played. The HD edition along with the Forgotten makes the game a lot better. It's still a vibrant game after more than 10 years and still the same game as I used to remember it. I bought the game (the original Age of Kings) back in 1999 when I was a kid for about $50. Expensive, I know, but the game was an eyeopener. It literally turned me into a PC gamer for life. It's literally the magnum opus of all the Age of Empires games."
thish gayme is leyke pehtting a ferreee kihten. when i pway et oi git all teawy up insheyed and strangle myshelf. ehrrrrrrrrrrr
I do like this game with HD maps and beter support for windows 7 had no problems so far Good Game :)
Most balanced RTS of all
Great game. Glad this came out with new units and campaigns. Opening up the game to the community for mods and extras is just brilliant.
7/10
If this gem isn't in your library you need to hang your head in shame.
"When they said remake the game I thought they'd at least rewrite the networking part and the UI so it DOESNT BUG OUT SO DAMN MUCH  When you put the bugs aside though, you get quite possibly the best RTS game ever made. :)"
"Such a classic game, it's definitely a throw back to the original. If you are feeling a bit nostalgic pick this up and play for a few hours. Kick back and play with a couple friends as well!"
"Age of Empires 2 is a must have if you even think you want to try any RTS. I haven't played the third but between youtube videos and trailers for the game, it doesn't look as fun. Age of Empires 2 may be a little tough to get the hang of but once you have all the basics down, its hard to stop playing. I had the original AoE 2 and the HD edition is the exact same with extra content in the form of DLC. The only diffence is the graphics which honestly isn't a noticable difference. However, with the new steam workshop integration and creative mod makers, the game's graphics can be heavily improved with the simple click of a button. There is a lot of positive stuff I could just ramble on about but instead I'm just gonna say that unless Age of Empires 2 HD is in your steam library you can't say you own a fun game"
"Unlimited replayability, great multiplayer game with friends.  The devs are still doing updates periodically for this 15 year old game, that shows how amazing it is."
"First time playing this kind of game, goodbye world."
10/10
This game have been good as always.  and best game if you're bored and trying to pass time as fast as possible ;)
still one of the best RTS games ever! Definatley worth grabbing.
Another Stratergy game which is fun like hell with friends community Isn't that nice at times towards others but It's a really good game I highly recommend it 10/10
"The Leading Game, the second installment of the Age of Empires Series, just got better, greater &amp; more amazing. The graphics of the HD Edition is really appreciable. Also, players are co-ordinating well.  Fact is that, they should provide own hosts for players to join and play rather providing to create one."
Classic game. The best RTS game ever.
"A good update, multiplayer works well, nice to be able to use more of the screen res.  Note game still isn't multi threaded, so lags a bit on high pop cap games with lots of players (four players 500 pop cap can become unplayable over the interenet in the same city)"
Love it!
"Age of Empires: Age of Kings was my first ever computer game I played, and what really brought me into the PC gaming world. When I saw this on the store I Immedietly bought it along with the expansion. I must say, it has been amazing playing. Recently I have gotten more intense into the competetive side (I'm still not that good), But it's amazing to see how thriving the community is.  For all of you who say this is the exact same game as before I have a couple of points for you. 1) It runs better on newer end computers, and people who don't have a cd drive can still play it, 2) the addition of the steam workshop added a whole new aspect to the game, increaseing replayability. You can try out all different types of maps and gametypes without haveing to go through too many hoops. and 3) have you tried playing multiplayer on the non-HD version? The addition of an actual matchmaking service lets you play with people other than your friends, opening you up to more diverse play styles, always keeping the game interesting.  The expansion adds more than just a few more civilizations (which are awesome in themselves), but also adds more campaigns, and a Mega Random map option which is just so much fun to play on.   All in all this game is a monumental game in PC and strategy gaming, and this remake does it justice. I would reccomend buying this game if you like strategy and/or are interested in medeival warfare. However I would also say to hold off on buying the Forgotten expansion until it goes on sale if you are unsure about it."
"What an example of a timeless game. I never had it as a child, but after some friends got it at college it happened to go on the daily sale and I got it for $5, is it worth $20? only if you have friends to play with in my opnion, but still fun to play nearly 15 years after it came out"
"Once you realise this is an expansion to the Law and Order game from 2019, you can't believe how detailed the story is."
I really like this game
play for 3 hours and lose every game
Brings back memories :D After all these years it has pretty solid gameplay and graphics. Thumbs up 
"Love this game, first off all it brings back great memories of my childhood, but it does more than that. the new empires are awsome and I really enjoyed playing the new campaigns that were added. Unfortunatly the AI is buggy along with many other sections of the HD version, but I personally thought the game was worth just the extra senarios and having steam workshop support."
One of the best games ever brought back and improved
Good way to spend the day taking down other players!
"This game is probably one of the best isometric RTS games in the entire universe. This may be a bold claim but its not demanding of your system, gameplay is solid, doesnt have annoying ♥♥♥ music playing in background, and yada yada yada. Its here, its queer, get used to it.  GOLD TEAM RULES!"
"Family favorite since it came out, and still a go-to game when we are looking for something to play."
"This game is my all-time favorite strategy game ever since I was 10, mostly on the Age of Kings. For this HD version of this game, my final rate of this game is 9.5 out of 10. Thus, it brings me a lot of nostaglic memories for playing challenging campaigns, random maps, and scenario map editor."
Lovley game from my childhood. Best played with friends against either players or really hard computers!
"Nothing beats the old school RTS, great game to play with friends!"
"The best RTS and E-Sport game out there. Compared to some of the other RTS games, the old graphics of AoE II are not as vibrant or varied as those of Starcraft or AoE III. The storytelling also isn't nearly as fast paced and invigorating as that of some later games, missing the animated cinematics. However, the gameplay is simple to understand, lightning fast, and perfectly balanced between civilizations. You also get out of it whatever you put in, with games being long or short depending on your settings and aggressive or layed-back style of play.  Cons: -Somewhat outdated graphics -Poor quality storytelling -Civilizations very similar -Can be lightly difficult to tell units apart -Multiplayer is very competitive and hard to break into  Pros: -Very balanced multiplayer -Simple to understand gameplay -Wide range of difficulty -Large and vibrant community -Long or short games based on preference -Variety of historical campaigns -Variety of mads, user-created content, and maps to extend the game indefinitely"
This game is going to ruin my life... Five stars
It can be a really nice social game. Get your buddies together and form a team or fight each other. Either way it is a good time.
Nostalgia polished and set. It's wonderful.
"Great Game! I like it more than AoeIII by FAR. This game is just a classic and is way more in depth that AoEIII, even though is not HD but more of an HQ version, still looks great and works very good, a few things here and there but anything to worry about. The only thing that I didn't like was that they removed LAN, thats how I expected playing it the most, but yet I've had a lot of fun playing this game"
it wopnt update to 3.3 for me
"I felt it worth buying simply because this is one of my favourite ever games from my childhood, and any sort of expansion to it is worthwhile to me. Though the high definition graphics are brilliant, there are issues, in that the controls feel a little antiquated. Civilization expectedly makes this game feel pretty old.  If you're a fan of the game it's definitley worth getting, especially is you buy the Forgotten expansion pack too. But it depends solely on the price. I only felt right buying it when it was on sale, but full retail price of £15 (ignoring the Forgotten expansion which will set you back £23) just isn't worth it. I'd give it a yes simply due to my sentimental attachment to the series that got me into strategy gaming."
a great game to play if you have 4 hours to kill
This is the best RTS game since 1999.
AoE 2 is a classic that deserves a spot in every gamer's library. Get it when you can!
really cool game
Great game to play with friends and have large footmen wars. Highly recommended for one of the best RTS games I have played! :D
"Legionaires bugged up for me, now only got Jaguar warriors.  Cant fix this isue no matter what I have done... aside from that awsome game."
"Great game, both the campaign and the random game aspects are perfect."
LudaKris map setting requires a pretty beasting computer(as even mines - which is good struggles) but everything other than that is just like old times with a graphic s overhaul. 10/10
"Excellent game - loved the orginal, the HD remake is just as great :-)"
"Loved this game, I used to play this with 3 of my friends back in 7th grade in computer class. We played this all the time till we had to start class but man I missed this so much. But now I have now on steam its like i was gifted to power of AOE once again."
"One of the best RTS games of all time, the HD version Doesn't change this classical game. Still Remains to be the best in its time and today."
"♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. I've had the original since it came out and when it came out on Steam I had to have it. It's even better than I remember it and they're now releasing new content for it. Obviously the community is quite devoted to keeping the game alive. 9/10, would buy."
Age of Empires! Rogan! Wololo!
Awesome Game. Fun to play with friends!
"This was the first videogame I've literally ever played, and I've loved it ever since.  Siege Weaponry OP  Spam Teutonic Knights"
;)
"Highly recommended, one of the all time great RTS games ever created."
this is a good game if you have the time to play it 
Age of Empires is a classic and still very addictive im happy I purchased the game
old stye game for nostalgia only :)
"I enjoyed it 10 yrs ago, and still love it."
This game is mostly fun for one reason a game increase in speed and balance between each of the aoe and aom games. Also it does not play like aoe 3 or aom 2 or aom1. Love the music and hd graphics.
"reboot of an old classic!  If you liked the original, go for it!"
A HD Remake of a Classic PC game and was my first RTS so has a special Place in my heart. not a lot has changed from the Orginal other than steam workshop support so people can add mods to the game to make it how they want it. Overall a good job from Microsoft for doing somthing the PC Gaming Comminity LIked. Worth Picking it up if its on sale :P
"one of the best rts games ever made, enough said."
ILL TAKE 20!
If your reading this your stupid. Just buy the game... need i say more.
This game is so classic and epic! Brings back awesome memories! I recommend this game fun cheep and doesn't get old to fast!
"Takes me back. Some of the fields are very time consuming, but still a fun well balanced game."
A game that lasts forever.
This game is still till this day my favourite Strategy game. So fun with friends. you can put countless hours into this and still learn more about this game everyday.  Pick it up you're missing out!
"An old relic brought back alive, Age of Empires 2 HD brings back a strategy game loved by so many people.  Not only is it great fun and playable for anyone, but it's really smart and even educative!  + A game brought back alive, now with Steam Cloud and Workshop support + Endless fun, a gem for strategy lovers + The game has low requirements regarding computer specs and still looks nice  - There are no bad things about this game. Just nope!  They even added a DLC to this game that brings new balance and new civilizations (new units!).  Don't waste time reading reviews, just buy it already!"
"If you enjoy Real Time Strategy games, Age of Empires is definitely a title you should be familiar with. AOE II HD is, simply put a re-release of the Classic AOE II.   Despite the fact AOE does still work in Windows 7 and Windows 8 with some minimal tweaking (namely, closing Windows Explorer), Hidden Path, Ensemble Studios, and Microsoft released AOE II HD with an updated graphical tweaking, enhanced Multiplayer, and some Cloud options such as saving your game and character. Apart from this, AOE II HD is the same exact game.  The Conquerors content from the original AOE 2 Expansion is included with the base game. This includes the campaigns, maps, and civilization. The Multiplayer/Skirmish options have also been tweaked slightly but it is said the original LAN options have been removed. The game is also tied to Steam Workshop which will allow access to Community-created content - maps, sounds, etc.   The Forgotten Expansion contains 4 new campaigns, additional civilizations and units. Altogether, you are paying roughly $30 for content you can still buy at Wal-Mart for $10 (from the Software Value Bin) that has been available for the last 15 years with some additional content. However, the built in map creation tools (also available on the older version) allows fairly straight-forward map creation. This means creation of custom maps is a painless process and sharing them with your friends or uploading to the Workshop can be done by most, if not all players.  Personally, I would like to see more new content from the publshers - additional Campaigns, additional map tools, better implementation of the existing content - Something that would make plunking out $30 for a 15 year old game a much better value. I would recommend picking this game up during a Steam Sale to take advantage of better savings, but if you've never played this game before, ths is one of the great games in RTS gaming."
so funny to play with your mates
love this game! one of the best old school strategy games ever!
This is a game review
"I haven't seen a different AI but still the game is as enjoyable as it was. Graphics are better, and i did prefered that second opus than the third one.  For few dollard, you'll play several hours. Very good bang for the buck."
Better Graphics New In-Game Music...But Multiplayer You Easly Get Kicked You Must Get Better Rank Or Something Like that... But I Advice You To Try It.
"Takes me right back to childhood, still a great game and probably the best rts ever made (especially for the current price)"
I never get tired of playing this game. The last I played it just made me wanna play it again so I did!
Never not worth the money!
you HD ♥♥♥♥ing quality lowered my fps drastically + over priced 4/10
"My all time favorite RTS series. I played the orginal game in the early 2000s and when the HD edition came out I bought asap. Age of Empires is a great game for new RTS players and expert ones to have fun and enjoy building your empire and creating Armies. Win by pure domination, win by gathering acient relics or win by being friendly, the choice is yours."
"Epic, just like it was when I first played it. Love the better graphics!"
"This game is so good. Having played it loads back when it orignally came out, playing it again now without the dated feel of it just feels so brilliantly nostalgic."
"just does not seem to get old, beautiful game. Plain and simple, fun and very time consuming, achievements, into making it 'perfect game' - all achievements done, will take a lifetime to complete"
"I remember being three years old, playing this game on my grandfathers lap (albeit sucking at it terribly.)  When i first saw the announcement trailer I FREAKED OUT as i had lost my old copy. the graphical improvements, the free conquers DLC and the new forgotten DLC make this my best purchase of the year!"
"Love it love it love it, just like the AoE II I remember. All the old stuff that I know and love plus more. Recommend it to anyone that's a fan of AoE of RTS as a genre.  "
"I enjoy this game because there are so many tactics, unique civilisations and units to choose from the conquer the enemy and the world. "
Very fun stategy based game the specifically revolves around 2 specific units for definite victory.  Petard - Suicide bomber  Monk- Wolololo
"Nice touch up to the original, massive lagg though in most games online."
Age of Empires II was my gateway drug into PC Gaming. It's allure hasn't dulled in the slightest over the years. And now with the Forgotten DNC I can fully unleash the carnage of the mighty Kingdom of Hungary!!
"I love the Age of Empires series, truly i do. but i seem to have ran into a problem where whenever i enter the actual combat map the screen goes white. i can still see the mini map and everythign else but not the actual important thing is there any way i can fix this error or am i screwed until i can get a new video card"
"Age of Empires II is an RTS game that redefined everything. It's graphics, while they are dated, are still beautiful by todays standards. This game literally is RTS in every definition. This isn't Warcraft where you manage two resources for all of two minutes then build an army. If you don't completely work your economy, and use it to strategically build your army, you will lose. If you are the defensive type, it is extremely easy to do this. Five layers of walls, some guard towers, and some trebuchets occasionally and you're ready to go!  I really enjoy this game, and anyone who wants to claim to be an RTS fan should buy this."
Loved this awhile back playing on my friends computer. Now that I have my own computer I was excited to see this game was available. Just like before I love making my own scenarios and lose track of time.
"This game...oh God. So many memories. If you played the original AoE II--or just like strategy games--I heartily recommend it. Sure, it isn't that different from the original, but if you have a more modern OS, you won't get rainbow water and bloodgrass with this one, so that's cool."
"The game itself is excellent, the nostalgic feeling I get whilst playing it is even better. First got it on Christmas 1999 when playing on a computer as useful as a potato and Bonzi Buddy giving that potato viruses. Though I can't complain, I have it now and it's worth every penny."
"Very Fun, A must-buy."
Old days strategy at his best strongly recommended
"Don't pay more than $5 for this, but it's still fun."
"Awesome game in the series, probably the best of the series. Does anyone remember the Star Wars game based off the game's engine? Anyhow, this was a fun game, espicially in school lol. I'm so glad they did an HD remake/update to this game. I hope they do the same with the first of the series as well."
"Played this game when it first came out, same with Mythology, still has the captivating glow of happiness and excitement that it washed over me when I was young.  Age of Empires II HD  Pros: Almost unlimited enjoyment from tons of map/civ types and incomprehensible number of strategies to defeat your opponents. Simple fun, extremely time consuming and enjoyable. The HD remake looks great, but still keeps the vibe from the original release. 9/10 for it's genre. Probably only beat by Age of Mythology for the fun abilities :)   Cons: Mayans are an OP civ. But seriously there are only a few tiny flaws in this game, one: that it isn't longer. Although you can get thousands of hours of enjoyment from map editor and randomized games. Two: Not everyone has it, you can still easily find multiplayer games but the chances of your friends randomly having it is slim. "
"Very Very Good Game. This game was practically my Childhood. I love it,"
Dis is a good game 10/10
The DLC have Slavs (my ancestors) vodka/10 would recommend
worth it
"Such a sick game, so good to go back in time and jam this. Get it on sale asap!"
"Absolutely wonderful game! This was one of the first strategy games I played as a kid, and is still easily one of my favorite games! If you enjoy strategy, battles, and world building, this is a must-have for your game collection!"
"So this is a hard one for me. Basically, I feel like I'm writing this review about the original game, Age of Empires II, which is (still) freaking awesome and fun to play, especially with friends. The difficulty can be set low for beginners or very hard for absolute experts, in case they like facing challenges. Building up your own medieval territory has never been as fun. You have to choose a society to play with, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses. Then you fight each other. That's about it.  Now of course the original is old and so is its engine. What I expected from this HD-Remake was to improve the visuals of the game, make it available for online play again, cutting out bugs and redoing some parts of the HUD. But all this game does, is offer you the option of playing it with a higher resolution (something that in my opinion could have been done way more efficiently by releasing a patch for the original). While this is exactly what it promisses, I still wouldn't pay the full price for a game, that was basically published twice. Instead, wait for it to be on sale and enjoy massive battles with your mates.  "
this is ace
"It's basically the exact same game as Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, but remastered for HD and with historical civilizations instead of Star Wars."
"This is the BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! ecpecially if you have friends to play it with. I recommend getting the forgotten dlc as well so you have more civilizations. It can be sooooooooo fun to figure out which civilizations are best for things and the more people the more stratagy. Also, this game can get very lagy so be carful if you have a slow computer or if you play online with bad internet."
One of the best strategie game ;)
Awesome game so happy i found this
Love it.
"An overall good reprisal of an older game. There are some occasional bugs and flaws, but they are usually worked out in various patches. I would recommend buying the HD version of this game, and even moreso if it's on sale! Check out some reviews about the Forgotten expansion. Has a good amount of new content plus some new civs and a ton of tech changes/balances."
God old game in new look
Still a decent real time strategy game and it's much more fluently on Windows 7 than the old version
i love this game
"Great game! But be careful, it´ll suck your time like nothing else!"
An obvious classic with an improved and active multiplayer system. One game I whole-heartedly reccomend for old and new players alike.
"Well, what can I say. I mean, it's freaking AoE II. Honestly i'm just doing this for the badge."
This game was a big part of my childhood around middle school. This classic RTS that Microsoft Studios developed pioneered the RTS genre to what it is today. If you remember playing this game (or have never played it) then get this HD re-make with Steam matchmaking support! Oh and go Britons!!!
"Classic game, now in HD...   Still amazing, and a little unbalanced, but always fun"
This game is alittle old but it one of the best RTS around i had good menories playing it when i was little 
Amazing game woth the money on sale or not.
"One of the greatest RTS in HD, thats all you need to know. Is it worth it at $20, no, if you can find on sale then yes."
"great game, but why only 1 country 'slavs' and so many aztecs, mayans, incas?"
"What's to say, same than 15 years ago, great multiplayer fun. loved it when I was a kid, still playing it!"
The best RTS of all time after Starcraft.
"Blast from the past that plays (fairly) nice on modern hardware. Runs smooth, looks pleasing and the gameplay mechanics hold up quite well even today. Certainly a buy on a sale though if your not a fan of this genre or this title in particular I might watch some gameplay videos first."
"Wololooooo is back, in HD!"
Adam buy this
"Fun, I used to play these games when I was a kid/teen. Good if you are a fan of the old series. If not you might get turned off by the old school game play and graphics, even in HD."
"This is quite possibly the best RTS game ever. Gathering Resources, generating a strong economy while maintaining a strong military status is made very simple. Considering that this game relies on single units to run the economy, it stands alone and above other RTS games for this reason alone.   The game time can range from 15 minutes, to over a few hours, depending on how the players utilize their time and resources. No two games are ever played alike, for this reason. Every decision made has a huge impact on the outcome of the game, and there are many ways to become the winner.   I Highly recommend this game : 11/10"
_(:з ゝ∠)_ Great way to spend days of your life without realizing it.
"I remember playing this game as a kid with my Grandad, such a hit of Nostalgia and the multiplayer means I can play with my buddies. Not Bad :3"
Nothing changed but HD graphics r nice..
"Fantastic game, it's just like the old one, but HD."
"So much nostalgia. Just like I remembered, and that's a good thing. Next step: multiplayer via Steam, which will fix my one negative memory about this game - dealing with LAN connections."
"This game is amzing! Very addicting, very fun, up to 8 players multiplayer or battle with AI, this game has it all and with so many civilitations to choose from the DLC 'the forgoten' the game is endless! Now if only steam had Age of Mythology. Mabey one day."
Such a great game! Highly recommended.
"One of my favorite RTS games. If you've played Total War, or Starcraft, or any other good RTS, you will love Age of Empires."
dont play this game
Great game. Soo much better then the original. DLCS rock. 10/10 and a game everyone needs to get.
"AAAAAAAAAAH HA HA HA HA COWER PEASANTS BEFORE MY MIGHTY ARCHER ELEPHANTS!!!   Besides my maniacal tendancies in the game, it's quite fun and is strategically yes... take that as you will."
"Age of Empires 2 is a very good game, but Age of Empires 2 HD Edition is even better! =D"
"All the classic AOE but with a beastly upgrade in population size, map size and civilization variety. Nothing incredibly noticeable with the graphics in my opinion and the game lags when first played however each time you play it, it runs smoother.... had some issues with multiplayer (LAN) handling the amount of troops being thrown around in a 3 player game.    Besides for a few minor bugs I was very very happy with the game!"
better than starcraft
Nice little throwback to the childhood days.
great game
Enjoyed that the calssic game has been remastered all into one game. The expansion and everything. The new expansion is a lot of fun. I am able to play with my brothers across the United States like old times!
"From time to time I catch myself wondering to play it again. It won't satisfy me forever, but it's sandind still..."
Awesome game as always!
"Great game, dont expect more than the original, cause its just the same except it looks great on a 100cm tv, Needs to be able to zoom out further though, the area you can see is tiny and hard to concentrate on doing things while moving the map around"
"Built a navy, and I sailed to victory 10/10"
The Best RTS Game  EVER!!!http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/# 
"After getting this game about a month ago, I have fallen in love and awe all over again of what was created 14 years ago, but there is a concerning feature. This game had LAN capabilites. Finding out that this version has no LAN makes me a little sad. Getting lag ridden matches constantly bugs me and having friends over for a bit of warfare (yes, I do this) seems to fallen by the wayside. I'm sure there are many others in this transport ship, and just adding LAN would make this a perfect game, if purely for some old skool raiding parties! WOLOLO!!"
"Sort of a Ral Time version of Civilization.   It plays well and it brought back memories fromt he original Age of Empires. tf you haven't ever played it before, are looking for an RTS, and don't mind a slightly outdated game, this is fine. However, there are a lot of other games out there you could be playing..."
It may be old but it's one of the best RTS if you want some simple fun without studing everi units stats.
this game sucks
"A classic re-defined. If you played AoE2 at all then you can expect the same great game, with updated textures and resolution. The sprites and animations look much better than they ever did before. Also with the added capabilities of modding, you can't beat it. I would highly recommend picking this titel up if you are a fan of RTS games. 10/10"
great game classic!!!!
I played this game a lot when I was a kid and this game has certainly aged well. It's still a lot of fun and challenging. The game looks pretty much the same except for a few texture changes. The one great thing that this game features is a revised multiplayer part. Great fun!
Old but gold
Nice HD upscale of the original game. Not worth the full price tag of £14.99 as you can get the original for under £5 on Amazon. But worth a sale price deffinitely.
"I owned the original version of this game way back in the earlier 2000's and was sad to see one of my favorite games fall to compatability issue when I upgraded to Windows 7, this is the answer, the game is practically identical to the original version, and there's nothing wrong with that, I never really got into Age of Empires 3 but I loved Age of Empires 2, I didn't want any 'advanced game mechanics' or 'high end graphics', I wanted the exact same game I had before and that's exactly what I got.  Thanks Steam, You always pull through for me."
"Classic game with some upgrades in terms of pop limit, and updated textures. Still needs updates to match making (rather than just a old MSN style match making) but great to play with friends."
"This game truly brings back the nostalgia from MSN Gaming Zone days. If you were an Age of Empires fan of old and miss the 999 taunts, the epic deathmatches or crazy RPG scenarios, definitely buy this upgraded version. It is very worth it!"
Top kek. Would shill out $20 again. Sick dosh
"I've always loved this game. Picked it up from Humble Bundle for 7 bucks and man, am I glad I did! It's my childhood all over again, except this time instead of mainly watching my dad play through it, I get to. Love, love, loooove it."
"Classic, awesome, base build and combat game!!!!!!!!!!!"
just like the original for some good flash back gaming!
"Age of Empires II HD is exactly what it says on the cover. It is AoEII with all of it's strength and faults with prettier graphics. It is a game that represents a long ago age of RTS mechanics and ideas.  If you never played Age of Empires II back in the day, you need to go into this with certain expectations in regards to mechanics: Unit controls, pace, building/resource/advancement pacing - they all work, but they don't feel as tight and refined as they do of games today."
A must in the realm of rts games. I have probably spent a total of 200+ hours on this game before it was re-released in hd on steam.
Still as fun as you remember. One of the few games that easily stands the test of time.
"excellent strategy game, one classic master piece, if you wanna try this game, you better do it, you will not regret it"
Great classic.
"wololololo this game is the dankest shieeiiet, and i haven't even played it yet"
"If you like real time strategies you can't go wrong with this game. I have played age of empires 1 and 3 as well but 2 is by far my favorite, this may just be me being nostalgic for it but it is a lot of fun."
HD? There is nothing HD about this. It's the exact same thing as the original.
one of the best games in the best RTS series. I highly recommend age of empires and age of mythology to any strategy gamer
"This game still is, in my opinion, one of the simplest yet most fun strategy games that has existed and I'll love it forever."
"This is a classic RTS game that never gets old. Play and feel reminds me of Command and Conquor but period of warfare is set in a much older timeframe. It's definitely worth playing. For an interesting battle, set resources to low and population to low. Relics will be your friend... collect them all!!!"
Still one of my favorite games of all time
Really brings back the memories
"One of the first games my dad taught me how to play was Age of Empires II at the age of 5. Now that I have a gaming computer, it seems only fitting that I own the HD remake to one of my all time favorites"
"Avoid the Forgotten realm at least you are a vicious of the multiplayer wanting more... I was hopping a regular campaign with regular voices... not even the voices appeared (At least not on other language than english)... the IA of the computer seem to be better BUT your own unitys now are more bad when walking on groups (usually blocking between themselve).   Conclusion: the classic game is that, and without no problem on single player, but the Forgotten don't seem to be really useful (First mission and probably my last one)."
Fantastic remake of a classic.
The Greatest Game That Ever Evered
"Been playing since I was young, I enjoy this game very much! If you love one of those strategy games where you can control what you build and what you produce, this is the game for you. With various gamemodes and custom single and multiplayer, don't think you're going to see the light of day again until 3 days later."
living the micro life is the hard life.
Classic game - still rocks!
same old game but still awesome
"Best game ever in the age of empires series, games could last you anywhere from 1 hour to 4 hours or more depending who gives up in multiplayer! but im 100% sure i wont give up :) anyway the single player is great, lots of fun and somewhat long as i havent finished it yet as im a multiplayer whole :) your first few games will be hard but fun ( call for back up from your team mates! )   But i have to say if you love games like starcraft or age of mythology then your love this game lots too maybe even more :)  5 star worth every penny !"
Really good and a lot of fun.
Can't go wrong with this game. One of my favorites since I was a kid.
"Same old same old, classic game. Liked it as a kid, liked it as an adult."
"AOE2 is really the best of the 3 AOE games. I remember playing this back in '99, and here I am 14 (almost 15!) years later getting the game again thru Steam and having a blast playing it. The game is as fun to play now as it was back in 1999. If you like these types of strategy games, you will be very happy with AOE2."
"Very fun and addicting strategy game, I been playing it since I was a kid and still love it. The game makes you think a lot, you need to be precise and fast to win, you gain experience by playing several matches, by analyzing the technique of your opponent or developing your own."
this game is something amazing. The multiplayer is something easy and fun. Me and my friend have been running huge conquest gmes and just letting time fly. a 4.2 out of 5. 
Enjoyed it very much.
"This improves little on the original, but it didn't need to. I love marching through the historical campaigns as much as playing with friends."
"Way better than the original, and youve got to love the mods."
"Awesome game. Same as when it first came out.   The only thing I get frustrated (as when I originally played it) with is the large jump in computer difficulty when increasing in difficulty: Standard difficulty is at a nice, leisurely pace but the computer never really builds up an army; in Moderate difficulty, they are in the 3rd age and with a significant army in about 10 minutes.  "
Best strategy!!!
"Not really more HD than the orginal age of empires 2, but with the help of the steam community you can make it look very nice!"
For saying it came out in 99 it holds up well.
Very much similiar to the orginial game. I do not like that LAN was removed as I like to play with my family. Now we will have to play through Steam 
"Just awsome, bring us back a long way!"
The potes
"If you love empire building and challenging campaigns, AOE 2 will suit you."
A classic. You cant go wrong with this one if youre a fan of old school RTS
Best RTS I've ever played... Perfectly balanced and nostalgic
Always a great classic! The HD edition looks very similar to the original except that it works on new OS.
I absolutely loved aoe2 back in the day and this makes it a lot easier to play with others. Wish you could do LAN and easier MOD integegration but it is still a great grab if you miss saying 'more food please'
A nice update to the game.
"A classic remade, perfect for flaring up old rivalries."
"Same as ever, but the no longer functioning ipx online play now uses a Steam lobby. Steam Workshop is pretty good, too."
"Just like I remember it, except now in 1080p."
GJ Microsoft Studios I want hear about AOE IV
"Fully enjoying playing through an Age of Empires game yet again! I'm just getting back into these kind of strategy games and this one has been a great starter to re-enter into the world of gaming for me. I'm still trying to figure out how to get bigger maps as I've been on much smaller maps, making the game significantly less exciting but that's on me, not the game!  I'd recommend this to gamers who want a strategy game that can be at varied levels of intensity and for gamers who are just getting started. The tutorial was a helpful feature that I did not end up using since I knew the basics of the game but others have found helpful!   Graphics are clearly not as you would find in more modern games so people who have overly high expectations should try to not compare it to other games.   Overall a great title to put several hours of game play and thought into!"
"Age of Empires 2 is one of the best Real Time Strategy games. It gives you the freedom to build your structures anywhere, which some RTS games limit you to certain areas. I've spent many, many, many hours playing this game. It's great!!!"
"Classic, with some new campaigns!"
If you are a hard core Age of Empires fan YOU MUST GET THIS GAME!!!
"I have played Age of Empires 2 since before the original expansions, The Conquerers.   The new looks made availble through the STeam workshop have defeintely made this a required update for me, and worth far more than the price to being back an old favorite that had fallen to the wayside.   Thanks Steam Dae"
"Hey look, Age of Empires 2 is back that can only be a good thing right? You're wrong, all of the issues that existed in the original still exist in this mega updated HD version (aka bigger screen resolution). Poor unit formations, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that double back on themselves, lag while playing with AI, lag from the scoreboard, general lag and more lag.   It's ok though because they updated the food icon to be PETA friendly. Except for on the farms and every other food resource, maybe they forgot?"
"If you've got the original Version, Skip this one. Nothing groundbreaking here, almost unnoticable visual changes. The Forgotten Expansion, adds a couple new races, but again not enough to make it worth buying. On the other hand if you've never played, it is a good game, wait for a sale though."
Talk about nostalgia. I played this game as a small child when it first came out over a decade ago. Age of Empires II is a classic strategy game that will never get old.
"No matter how old it gets, this will always be one of my favourite games. I suggest everybody buys it."
"Brings back fond memories of playing this as a kid, only wish the company that made the game didn't go under"
"Everything which you remember from Age of Empires II and more. The matchmaking system is fairly fast and easy to use, included with many game customization options including game recording. If you have never played Age of Empires before, but have played games such asL Empire Earth, Command and Conquer etc. You will find that this game has a lot of unique features and that games can either be played for a long duration, or can be 'rushed' and finished very quickly. Even if you've never played a Civilization building/war strategy game before, I still strongly reccomend this game, as you simply cannot call yourself a gamer unit you've played a strategy game such as this one."
I wasted hours upon hours with this game years ago... now its back in HD... Time to waste many more hours!
Such a classic
"You can make OP suicide bombers, 10/10."
Great game. Best RTA game ever made. Hours and hours of fun. 5 out of 5 stars!
.
One of the best games of the last millenium remastered!
"This game just blows my mind. I've been playing the age of empires series ever since the first one and I got to say their all amazing. I had lost my previous AOE II disc so I had to go and buy another one anyway. But right on time this came and and I immediately bought it. This was the game of my childhood and I still get 100's of hours out of the series. My favorite will have to be the third game due to the fact that the units are well balanced. For example, in AOE II there is a Spanish civi. The spanish have a Conquistidor units that does 17 damage, it weilds a gun so it is also on horseback. A normal Knight fully upgraded only does 12 in the castle age, and hes on horseback too! Don't get me started on the persians. 600 Health, 20+ damage, no range (thank god) , and their reletivly slow. (Their War Elephants) Other then the Spanish, Turks, and Persians, their all well balanced. Except the longbowmen, in the imperial age they can have 12 range. But that takes some time to get to. Anyways, enough of my rant. This game overall is good and its a slight upgrade from the last with the easier online play and workshop. If you already own this game is it worth it? Absolutely not. Their are hardly any improvments in graphics, LAN was taken away, AI still remains broken in some aspects. (Don't get me wrong the AI is great, just in some cases when their stuck between other vilies or take a long route when clearly they can just take the short route, it can get anoyying) This is pretty much a resell to people who already own it. Its practically the same thing for 20$ more. Would I recomend this to a person who doesn't have it? Definetly, this game is well rounded and with enough time on your hands you can gets 100's gameplay hours out of it. I haven't hit 100 on steam, yet. BUt I definetly have over a thousand outside of steam. Total Score 9.2 Out Of 10.0"
"Good game and worth the money. I played this as a kid and was delighted to see that they had brought out a HD version, however it is not so much a HD version and more of a wide screen version but is still fun and works well on not so good computers and laptops as well as the pro computers. If you're looking to mod the game then it can be easily done through the steam workshop, but be WARNED some of the mods will effect online gameplay (which is a key aspect of this game) and may stop you playing online all together. Age of Empires is not easy to get into and may be boring for new players but if you love strategy games and are more focused on the gameplay rather than how good it looks, then this is the game for you.  Hope this helps anyone!!!"
Awesome update toi the best rts ever!
"One of the best games I've ever played!! AOE2 is a classic game of all time!! This HD version keeps the same playability of the original AOE. It includes all the civilizations of the Conquerors expansion. Also, there exists an expansion that adds even more civilizations! Maybe, I was expecting a little more in the graphics section.... Anyhow, the game remains as addicting as always!  9/10"
For many years I went back again and again to AoEII when socalled NEW games disappointed me. I still love it. The only thing I wish they had changed was to bring it into the 3D world. It would be quite a help to be able to rotate the map. I know AoE III was 3D. but somehow that series wasn't the same. AoE ll remains the better of the two versions even without 3D.
Makes me wanna do hood rat stuff with my friends
Great to play this classic once again! A great RTS  Looks great once you download some new Textures :)
an old classic brought back from the dead and updated graphics HOLY BAT S**T.
It brings back so many memories. I love it. Five stars! *****
"Strategic, challenging, requires multi tasking, I love it! and I get too a mass a large civilization to crush people &gt;:D"
Brings a lot of childhood memories back :D
"Excellent game, just like the good ol' days of AOE II."
Just buy it
just got it when it 50% off and now its 75% off :(((
I recommend this game
"Amazing remake, And to this day still supported by the devs!"
"This game is really good. It's the same as Age of Empires II, but with some new graphics and tweaks. It does really bring back memories from my childhood. Worth every penny buying!  10/10"
"A classic, but the multiplayer is glitchy."
Better than great
if you don´t buy this game you´r a fool!
"Can't reccomend enough, the original was fantastic and this adds to it."
AWWWW YEAH! My childhood youth game!
"Age of Empires 2 was a game of my childhood. It was a fantastic strategy game and I loved every second of it. I'm not ashamed to say that I gained a lot of historical knowledge from the campaigns and wow'ed my childhood friends with it. So now a new HD version with a long awaited expansion pack has been released I am more than happy to replay this game and rekindle my love for it and fulfill the nostalga nagging at me. Gameplay is as great as ever and with the new added campaigns there is so much more gameplay to explore; all topped off with rather fantastic soundtrack. I'm aware that online play is also an option, but that's not something I really take part in with any game. (But may explore in the future)  So overall, I would say that it is highly recommened to those who love thier history and/or stratagy games.  Fully recommended (but I am ever so slightly biased)."
Game of the Year 1999. Still got it.
I freaking love this game! You guys should get it!
One of the greatest RTS of all time. Spent countless hours playing this when I was younger. No excuse to not have this in your collection.
"I love this game. No matter how old it is, it is still so much fun to play with my friends, building civilizations to fight the enemy or playing against each other. While it still takes a long time, it takes less time than Civ5, and I personally enjoy playing it more. I hope anyone who plays it enjoys it as much as I do!"
Hard to believe such an old game could still be so much fun to play. This game is all of the wins :3
"Any1 who like strategy game, will enjoy AoE2 :) I can't stop playing."
A classic game that I grew up with. I remember playing this with cousins and friends. I love the fact that it has returned unchanged.
Its AOE 2. Just play it. Its amazing.
"Amazing game, bit old for its time but still has the same feeling it had when i was a kid. love it. buy and play"
Great game. Really brings back a lot of memories for those who had played this game before.
"AOE back in HD, I've played the original one since day 1 and this has brought back lots of great memories. Make sure you have good internet connection for online play other than that any computer can run this. Definitely worth it for any RTS fan or player. ENJOY!"
"Age of empires hp the forgotten is a very nice game but the path finding of your units isnt that good when you click on the map the units just run around or get stuck and dont run the fastest route, if they get stuck they dont move any furher and it is very frustrating hope they can make an update to fix that"
"Amazing game, 2 bug thumbs up"
Fantastic game even after all these years.
"I have been playing AOE 2 for years, and is still one of my top 5 games. AOE 3 has some really neat gameplay, but it just can't quite compare to AOE 2."
9/10
One of the first few classic games that got me into gaming.
this game is actually excellent the HD does show through the entire time :D
Aoe2 is the best RTS game out there!Buy with confidence.
"The new expansion adds a good deal of depth; although the campaigns were thrown together. The increased population, map size, and army size allows the player to be more strategic and frees up a lot of space where the maps felt claustrophobic before."
This.
"The new campaigns sort of suck, but everything else is normal and great. &lt;3 the LudaKRIS map =P"
"This game is amazing! I've played AoE before right from the very first, through the expansions and everything and this HD makeover is definitely worth it! Plus, the new expansion (The Forgotten) is awesome! :D"
"Well one of the best game ever im only disappointed by the new expansion, no prologue no voice acting?"
Best RTS of all time!
Much hours spent on this very good game. Very friendly low spec game players
"I remember playing this a lot when it was first released when I was younger. Well not much has changed, and it brought back all the old flare I used to remember when playing this (with friends especially). Graphics are a definate improvement although it really doesn't matter much because the game play is what this franchise is known for."
"Ahh classic AoE 2, sooo many hours playing this game. Good times :)"
"Extremely addictive game, takes a while to get good, still can't win a match online."
"Epic Game. Must have for any RTS person, and a must have for anyone who knows an RTS person.   I beg Steam to find a way to make this cross platform. That would make this the greatest game of all time on Steam I have no doubt.   "
Classic game and still one of my favorites! I really like the mods/skin packs which add alot to an already good game. Improved AI are very much a challenge and harder than the original. All in all it was worth the price for this gem!
"Great game! kill 'em quick or toy with the enemy.  5/5, 10/10, 385/385...you get the point"
this game is my childhood in a nut shell the game ill never stop playing 10 out 10 only down side is some of the mods dont load well
The gameplay is way too choppy and staggered. For a game so dependent on the mouse it is a disaster when the cursor staggers and or ignores what icon you have clicked on. I am running this on a machine that is WAY over-qualified for this game. No wonder AOE3 was downscaled so much - even this updated version of AOE2 is not capable of delivering all it promises.
REK NOOBS OLD STYLE 11/10
"I can't finish a single game because it continues to crash... AND MY ELO GOES DOWN!!! THIS IS TOTAL BS I TELL YOU...  AND I LOVE THIS GAME, WHY DID U RUIN IT?"
Great Copy of AoE 2 that is updated to run on new OSes and with HD textues.   2 thumbs up
Happy to see a game from childhood has improved to HD! Oh yes.
"If you saw the 68 metacritic score, you best be wipin that from your eyesockets, because they be full of it.  This is the best.  THE BEST.  BUY IT NOW.  ALL OF IT."
"Age of Empires 2 is an amazing, classic game. I absolutely love it and reccomend it, especially when its on sale!"
Great
old but gold.
"Yes,  Buy it on sale, it is cheap and good.  Get it."
"Now here's a blast from the past. I first played this game years ago, and I was far too young and impatient to bother with RTS games back then... yet for some reason I'd keep playing this game regardless.   It has a certain charm about it, and with the HD upgrades and the ease of multiplayer these days, it's a must purchase if you're an RTS fan and have friends to play along with!"
Good Remake of a Good Game
"A great game. If you never played it when it came out, definitely check it out now."
"This game really takes me back. I used to play games like AOE and Rise of Nations with my friends in highschool all the time, and it never got old. And the best part is that it doesn't just teach you strategy; it teaches you history as well (maybe not that much, but it's got some interesting stuff). I think the best part about it is that you don't even have to be a really skilled player to enjoy it (God knows I'm not the best). To can playtest endless different strategies against the AI nations in preparation for a game against your friends, and if that strategy didn't work, you can tweak 'till it's perfect. All in all, a pretty solid game. Even if the units per boat don't make any sense."
This game needs no real introduction. It's a classic 4X game that's on Steam now. Buy it.
Really fun. Great for playing with friends and just campaigning alone
"The only reason to play Age of Empires II is because its the second greatest strategy game of all time. I would say its the greatest strategy game of all time, but I'm prevented by the sheer fact that 'wololo' is the greatest unit sound ever.  So far I've had only a few bugs and the terrible graphical 'improvements' like the new farm textures can be fixed easily thanks to steam workshop."
One of the greatest RTS games EVER!
"This game is not just a nostalgia trip down memory lane. The graphics have been masterfully re-created to work on 1080p displays and flawlessly under new 64-bit windows OS's. The gameplay is smooth and the excitement and tension is all still there, just more alive and vivid than ever. This is on my list of 'Must Have' games and will be at home in any RTS fan's library of treasures."
best ever to get into the new year.
This game is a classic. Everyone of us has played AoE sometimes and we all know what this game is. You can spend hours just building your own empire and see it rise from nothing. AI is good enough at least with forgotten dlc and updates it brought. Even without it AI is good enough but sometimes it crashes and enemies don't do nothing. But mostly this game works almost percectly and is quite nice looking with HD. I'll give it 9/10
"Nothing beats the old school RTS, great game to play with friends!"
If this gem isn't in your library you need to hang your head in shame.
"When they said remake the game I thought they'd at least rewrite the networking part and the UI so it DOESNT BUG OUT SO DAMN MUCH  When you put the bugs aside though, you get quite possibly the best RTS game ever made. :)"
"Such a classic game, it's definitely a throw back to the original. If you are feeling a bit nostalgic pick this up and play for a few hours. Kick back and play with a couple friends as well!"
Faithful reworking of the original that brings it up to modern computer's standards but without changing the core game.
"Hours of fun, even if I am pants at it."
"If Age of Empires II HD is added to steam, then add Star Wars Galactic BattleGrounds, too. You would make a ton of people happy, including myself. Also, add the Clone Campaigns.  Thanks, :)"
"This is an old favourite of mine. Fantastic game and never gets old, despite its age. Would recommend."
"Back in the past, I actually had a thing for playing real-time strategy games like this one.  Now that it's the present, what better way to bring some of those memories back than the ability to play Age of Empires II in widescreen resolutions? I had fun with it in the past, and I bet you'll have as much fun as I had, too."
Got some friends? Got a few (or several) hours to spare for one game? Want a brilliant strategy game that still is good today?  BUY Age of Empires II Today!  Warning: Age of Empires will not be held responsible for ruining friendships if bullsh*t occurs.
"Grade A huge classic, I would recommend anyone who likes RTS's to play AOE. the second one was the best of all 3. from the base development to the fighting, it's still all round fun, years later :3"
"A great laid back Strategy game. When they say HD Remaster don't expect anything too fancy, but the game definently has aged much better than many of the other hit games of the early 2000's. 8/10"
10/10
A classic ROTS that I gleefully purchased in HD. Worth it just because I know I'll always have a little nostalgia to play on Steam.
Awesome reboot of an awesome game! Extremely fun with friends.
I really would like to play this on my Mac. :'(
"A fantastic reviving of a classic game. Age of Empires 2 HD brings back all of the nostalgia of playing this game when I was 12, with the added bonus and making me realise once more just how awesome this game is. To this day I lament that the Age of Empires series was cancelled before we got 4 and 5."
"played the hell out of this game as a kid, now i can play the hell out it as an adult  10/10"
you will never need another game or soundtrack or food or even sunlight with this game it is just too good i am not worthy
"If you loved the original, then get this. Simple as that."
"Timeless, This game never gets old. Like the new expansion pack."
"this is the game I grow up with, but it's the same imo, also they changed the name Moctezuma to Montezuma, it bothers me more that it should"
alot of fun
"This is such an amazing game. There is such a high level of strategy involved that adds depth to the game, making it the best RTS out at the moment. Really fun to play with friends and online. This version doesn't change any of the mechanics of the original game, but it does improve the graphics and cinematics/effects which adds value. There   There are some glitches with unit movement which can be frustrating, but that doesn't effect the overall gameplay too much.   Extremely recommended!   Overall: 10/10"
Awesome game but I can't see the reason for chrging almost 20 euro for att 15 y o game. Especially since it cost 9 euro a few days after the winter sale (sale price 4 euro) and the raised. I have no idea what it cost before the sale but it fells like steam raised the price just because they could so therefore I ONLY RECOMEND BUING THIS WHEN ITS ON SALE NEXT TIME!!!
"brilliant game not to be overplayed, best of the Age- games. dont overplay or listen to metacritic review"
A timeless classic RTS game. Highly recomended.
this game never gets old people should tottalyget this 10/10
"I've had a few copies of AOE2 + Conquerers over the years. The CD's have often got destroyed and new ones bought again. I used to play this game for hours. The Steam version of the game has fixed a few things that were broken originally. All of the network play used to be a nightmare to get going. This is fixed now and integrated to work with your friends list. The Steam workshop lets you customize the look of the game by downloading small mods, maps, music packs etc. The game resolution has been upped majorly and looks less pixelated then it is in the original by alot.  The only drawback for me with this game is the LAN feature. This is non existant and often I would play AOE in LANS. Despite the game being fantastic and made shinier not having the LAN feature blemishes things a bit. Currently if I wish to play with my siblings in the next room, it's played through the Steam network and not locally. Which means we can lag despite the short distance betwen us.  If you enjoyed the original. This game is exactly the same, shinier, would recommend it to vets looking for a digital copy.  Just don't expect any LAN play."
"It's a good game, a classic. BUT, in my heart, Age of Mythology will forever be better. Anyone with me? Anyone? :P"
It's Age of Empires II.... what more do you need to know?
"If you are not to sure on what this game is WELL THEN STOP AND LISTEN!  Age of empires II is one of the funnest games i have played, it is a stratagy game made to make you think while also having a blast :D you build you empire to a race to dominate others enimies playing. If you are looking for a new game This is it!!!  SOOOOO worth it :D"
It's the old Age of Empires with a better graphic but low PC system requirements. The game is fun to play and with the new addons better than the old version :)
Definitly a classic game. Some of the most fun I've ever had in an rts game.
"This Game is a classic gem. Been playing the original since i was 6 and now i bought this version to be able to play online w/ my friends and family w/o needing the same internet to play. if you are a fan of the original you'll definantly like this remake. If you are new and enjoy stategy games i definantly recommed this game. the only problem is the multiplayer online, it can be a bit laggy at times but other than that ive havent had many problems with the game. the price is a bit pricy if you have the original game, i'll admit i was a bit hesitant to buy it at full price so i just waited for a steam sale to finally pick it up. The game is still as great as the original and now with the improvments and expansion its even better than before and i'm quite happy with the improvments."
"The AoE franchise strikes me as one which favours big macro and big swings, or at least that's where the game really shines. You can have a big army and still end up wanting and needing specialized support troops. The balance naturally nudges you into a diverse playstyle. It creates a different feel than other RTSes. The way the tech tree feeds into and back out of the Town Hall for Age advancement makes macro feel noticably different and novel. You can have C&amp;C and SC/WC and still get a fresh feel here."
Shieettt ♥♥♥♥♥ this game is dope as ♥♥♥♥.
"Sometimes, with these kind of games, you'll fear that it dosen't play as good as when you where younger. This game is not one of them.  Age of Empires 2, is as good as it was back in 1999. Alot of the elements in this game, are also present in modern RTS games. The DLC with the 5 new civilizations are also a welcome edition to the game.   If you're looking for a classic RTS game to spend hours upon hours on, there is no better game then Age of Empires 2."
This is the very first computer game I ever played as a kid. This game brings backmany memories and still fun to this day.
Just as entertaining as I remember it being.
"Doesn't have guns, Call of Duty is better."
Still an amazing game. Spent a lot of my childhood playing this game.
"This was the 1st game (not actually the HD version) I startedmy PC gaming carrier, may the year of 1998 or approx. One of the best strategy game in the world, my Internet speed is not so good, so can't play it online smoothly. But always love to play it in LAN or SOLO Campaign mode or with BOT. The day you defeat a MODERATE BOT of this game, you will be a certified and pro strategy game player.  5/5 stars"
AoE 2 brings back memories from past days -&gt; it's still worth playing :D
"It's back baby, and I'm lovin it!"
"Timeless classic, hours of fun to be had!!"
"Good RTS game, plenty of campaigns and it still feels like AOE II, just a little aesthetic update."
"TL;DR: Tons of fun can be had, only to be ruined by the game freezing up.  I recommend this game to anyone who played it years ago, or for anyone who has an interest in the RTS genre. This is an easy game to pick up and learn with. I feel compelled to mention however, that this game has locked up on me for no obvious reason. Hopefully this is something that the developers are aware of and can issue an update to fix this."
Great game
"Perfect game! I was playing this game when it was originally released and was excited about that. The time is moving very fast and now all strategy games are 3D and contains a lot of breath-taking visual effects. AoE 2 doesn't glamour menus and modern 3D graphics, however it has powerful gameplay that is so cool even after 15 years since its public release. I purchased this game and spent few keen hours remembering how is good this game! Recommend it to every AoE lovers! In HD it looks awesome!"
"The legend lives on, now with slightly better graphics and new expansion pack!"
Just as addictive as i remember!
Brilliant game. Immortal. what the AI lacks it makes up for in vertitility.
Great strategy game
"It took me a while to pick this up and I really don't regret it. It's still the great game we all know and love, though it honestly doesn't look much better than it did all those years ago. Really quick and easy to make and join multiplayer games. Steam Workshop is bursting with dope ♥♥♥♥ to download and try out.  From my limited play so far the only thing I've noticed is the increased population cap (500) and missing LAN capabilities (dang).  If you're one of those people who still pops in the disc to play every now and then, then this remake is definitely worth your time and money. It takes me back to when you had to play on the ZONE (GOD DAMN what was that like 100 years ago or something?)."
"Age of Empires, the game of my childhood will always be in my heart."
"An epic game, well worth the $20"
pretty much the same as the original except slightly optimized. Nothing exciting here folks....
not so much hd but still the same terrific game that is was before now running more smoothly on windows 7
Its good game
One year ago I played this game and removed because too many bugs. Now its working as expected!!!
The best RTS ever created!
:)
Just like I remembered it from my childhood.
"Absolutely wonderful! I actually prefer AoE2 to AoE3, due to the intense variability offered in AoE2 games; you have dozens of civilizations to choose from, many maps that vary each playthrough, and the option to select 'random' for most anything and really try out the game in full. Totally recommend it."
pretty good. get it when its on sale. notihing to special.
great game wif old memory!!!
A classic brought into the new age with HD graphics that make it look fantastic!   Having spent months playing this as a kid it was nice to see it pop up on Steam with improved graphics. It brought back great memories of days long since gone!
"This is the game of my childhood. 8/10 amazing game, godfather of rts"
"The game to play during my college years. Over a decade later, the replayability is excellent"
Great. And Very Memorialable Game!
"This game is a staple of the RTS genre. Whether you are new to style or a seasoned veteran, AOE II has something to offer. The gameplay learning curve is relatively small. They have recently remapped the Hotkeys to be more intuitive. Developers are constantly working to balance and improve the game. As a long time fan of the original, the added bonuses of Steam multiplayer hosting and new expansions are wonderful. This game is worth every penny (and hour) you spend on it!"
"I may be biased based on my nostalgia from this game, but it's a really solid RTS."
Awesome game and brings back old memories.
"Age of Empires 2, what can you say more? It's probably one of the most remarkable Strategy Games of all times. It's an evergreen.  So to anyone that is wondering if this HD version is worth giving a try, I want to give my personal impressions.  Altough the launch of the game in April had major flaws. the developers have done things right and the game is finely playable. The game has one strenght, and it converts into the HD version the same as the original one: this game is one of the best well aged games ever made. Altough it's 14 years old, it doesnt play like this. It still has a very appealing look, while other games that are even younger, like C&amp;C Generals look like crap compared to it.  Basically it is the absolute same game as the titel you may have experienced in 1999, which is a good thing. The graphics and engine is updated so it runs smoothly and looks decently on newer machines and wide-screen resolution.   Important note concerning the overused term HD   So many people keep getting this wrong: HD does not mean better graphics, I have seen a lot of people buying this game and complaining in the steam forum s that the graphics don't look better, or aren't HD. Harsh words, but these people are clueless idiots. HD does not mean better graphic. HD is a resoluiton it's widescreen 16:9 1920x1080p. HD ready is 1280x720p.  Nevertheless the graphic looks smoother, and there are a lot of mods out there you can download via the steam workshop which gives you plenty of room to change the appearance of your game just as you want.  The big thing about the HD Version is, it revived Age of Emprires 2 for multiplayer, you can now easily play this game online again. Which is a great thing. I go as far as that this game is still the second best choice around if you want to play an RTS. The first would be Starcraft 2, which is a big thing for a game that old.  Age of Empires 2 still is awesome. And altough the newly released addon isn't an AAA production, which game can claim it got a new Addon 14 years later?  If you get your hands on it, in a sale which is 5 $ or 4 something € get it, it is still awesome."
GTA V IMMA LET U FINISH BUT AOE 2 is the best game of all time.
"Did you love Age of Empires as a kid? Then frickin' buy this game, because it is still pretty perfect."
"Pros: Probably the best RTS of all time Still the same game you played 10+ years ago Good for getting into RTS Excellent competitive community Makes sharing mods/custom scenarios much easier through the workshop  Cons: Laggy as fugg on multiplayer, you WILL lag out of many games. If you want to play seriously, stick to Voobly The game was written in an ancient code, meaning it is not well-optimized for newer PCs, and you can experience framerate issues due to this Price point- HD and nostalgia aside, it's still $20 a 15 year old game. And even though the Forgotten Empires expansion is nice, it's not worth another $10 to me.   Conclusion: If you're a die-hard RTS/Age of Empires fan, this is a must-buy now (if for some reason you don't have it already). If you're just looking for something fun to play and aren't too serious about it, it's still a must-get, but wait until a sale comes around to get it."
Classic from way back to 2000AD. Reboot is really the same game with expansion from 2001 and a few cosmetic changes. I do recommend it if you want to play a retro RTS game.  Achievements add the carrot to play.
BEST RTS GAME OFF ALL TIMES
"Great game, I had the original, and they only improved upon everything. they added the steam-based servers so that you can play online with friends or others, great game, 10/10 would play again"
"awesome game, way better than 3 i recommend it"
one of the best strategy games ever
I like the cars
Great Game Works well Looks better in hd mode Normal game has contrast problem so get this one multi play is good too :)  Remember this has i think all the DLC's for it too :) SO YAY ***** 5 star out of 5 for me :D
"This game looks beautiful compared to the original that has purple water now. The problem I have with this game though is that it is lagging a lot more then it used to. I was very frustrated when I was being attacked and my game was lagging so much that I was unable to even interact with anything. On a happier note, I do enjoy the new added content that is on the game that originally I did not have."
this is one of the best games ever. highly recomend it to all
"Age of Empires II is a fantastic game. If you were of fan of the game originally, simply being able to play the game again is worth the price tag. Thoroughly enjoy this game and I'm glad to have it in my collection again."
"Pretty decent remake; could have done more, but not bad for the $5 i paid for it."
this game is good
"This is the same game. But after 10 years they improved somethings, they added Ranked games, water in HD *sigh* , and a good multiplayer synchronized with Steam.   30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30  Just play and Wololo 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 "
"Learning new tactics, methods of playing etc. is always fun, the ability to play as a team (or a single village) with your friend(s) is a pretty good feature too."
"One of my favorite games of all time. Need to fast forward eight hours of your day? Play this. Oh, and the HD version is perfect - everything works with updated hardware. No need to fondle around with the old version with graphics issues, or instability while on mondern operating systems. Matchmaking is easy and doesn't require clunky software (just Steam)."
"This game is a revamp of Age II, which I have no qualms with. It didn't change anything I loved about the orginal version. Seeing that it has a reliable online server and some much needed graphic changes makes this a greta purchase to relive the old days with old friends."
Really liked!
"'WOOO! Age of Empires II in HD? That sounds amazing!' - me before playing it  AoEII HD is a great game with amazing gameplay and will give you hours of fun... however... not sure what the developer meant by HD. I already owned the original complete edition of AoEII and expected to be amazed by an overhaul of textures and art but it was a short-lived dream. Still giving this a great rating though since it is an amazingly fun game, has multiplayer, includes all the old expansions and reminds me of a time when you didn't have to have people swearing at you over the chat while playing.  Gameplay: 10/10 The HD I was sold: 3/10 "
"Although old, but it's a very interesting game."
its great
"Great classic game revamped, has connection aka 'out of sync' issues commonly with connections that are not rock solid which is kind of rediculous for a 15 year old game. But other than that is a blast from the past to play."
"Still has a bugs, even in the main mission line where some troops or animals would not attack."
The Greatest Game of are time !
Same old clasic game with updated graphics
this game is this ♥♥♥♥ and if you buy it you will be the ♥♥♥♥
"A great remake of an old game. Age of Empires 2 was probably the highpoint of the series for me. Stability can be an issue, but crashes are few and far between. There aren't many RTS games like this anymore, and with the free-to-play model ruining the genre, this is a welcome comeback. If anyone wants to play a RTS from their golden age, AoE 2 HD is definatly worth the price."
"All the greatness of AoE2 only with a functioning multiplayer, even has some addition features that make it even better then the original (increased pop)! 10/10 will play again! Such game, much impress!"
This is one of the early strategy games that gave way to more advanced RTS types of games. Super fun to play especially with a bunch of people.
"In 1998, I was in sixth grade, and my father brought home a new computer. With Windows 98, the newest version of Microsoft Office, and even Encarta, it was a bright and glorious future. Day after day, I came home, exploring every possible thing I could do with it. We wouldn't have internet access until the next year, so every possible thing was, in fact, somewhat limited. One day, searching through the folders of the Windows install CD (because what else do you do without internet?), I discovered a folder full of games. To be specific, trial versions of games. One of them was Age of Empires.  I was an immediate fan, playing the demo endlessly for (what I remember as) months while I tried to scrape together enough money to buy the full game. All my friends at the time were tranfixed by Starcraft, but I managed to talk a few of them into buying AoE as well, and we went through the confusing process of playing over direct dialup modem connection. I always kept the foldout tech tree near the computer, for easy reference. One day, my cousin saw it during a visit, and I found out that he too was a fan.. He was the one who, during his next visit, told me about Age of Empires 2.   The first game had simply clicked with me. The art style was simple and pleasent, and still doesn't look too bad these days. But by comparison Age of Kings was absolutely beautiful. There was detail - so much detail for the time, and so many little things that made the familiar game mechanics so much smoother. The first time I saw the rain of arrows coming down from a castle I think I laughed in the gleeful sort of way the only a preteen can. Age of Kings quickly became my favorite game of all time.  What I always loved most about either game were the custom campaigns. The superstars of scenario design made things with the campaign editor that can truly be called art. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, take a look at some of the downloads at  Age of Kings Heaven.  [aok.heavengames.com]  I recommend Ingo Van Thiel and Mark Stoker to name a few, but check out any of the top rated, it will be worth it. Since I was never actually very good at competitive online play, I spent most of my time on these elaborate single-player experiences,   Eventually I stopped waking up early to play before school. I played some other games, some by Ensemble Studios, many not. I discovered girls, and later alcohol, both of which occupied much of my time. I have never been far from this game, though.  So now we get to the HD not-quite-so-remake. Being not-quite-so because only a few things are actually change, making it more of a rerelease than a remake. Since Ensemble Studios, the group of masters who made the Age series, were inexplicably dissolved by Microsoft in 2008, its very possible to view this as just milking some intellectual property for every last dollar, with no profit to the developers. And honestly, most of the new things introduced here have been available for some time for the original game. HD means it supports high-resolution, which is also offered by the  UserPatch  [userpatch.aiscripters.net] , and the Forgotten Expansion is a polished version of the  Forgotten Empires mod.  [www.forgottenempires.net]   What is really new then? There's the rendered, water. It does look pretty, though I feel like it might clash a bit with the overall art style. For me it caused lag, so I turned it off. There are other graphical changes as well. Interface icons are different - I'm not sure why they took the time to make them, as there seems to be no advantage or improvement. I'm neutral on this one. A lot of noise has been made online about new farms, but for me, the farms are exactly the same as ever. Perhaps they patched it? If they did, I wonder why they would have bothered to change the farms, but leave the cliffs. Yes, the cliffs in AoE2HD are absolutely horrible, weird gray smudged things that completely contrast with the landscape around them. Luckily, its easy to fix via steam workshop, but the real question I have is why? Why in the world would they go through the effort of adding something that just doesn't look right? Why not just leave it alone, less work for them!  This seems like a lot of evidence stacked against AoE2HD, so it may surprise you to find out that I think its still worth the buy. What it really comes down to is convenience. Getting the original game running on Windows 7 or 8 (or Linux, like I use) requires some steps, but AoE2HD downloads and runs without a problem (not native on Linux, granted, but that comes with the territory). There all those fun steam features to go along as well - achievements (so superficial, and yet so motivating), cards and badges, and easy multiplayer. The Steam Workshop seems like a perfect match, yet I haven't been all too impressed with the content there, compared with AoK Heaven. AoKH has had a few more years to build its collection though, so maybe I just need to give steam some time.  So in all, even though AoE2HD doesn't bring all the much new to the table, changing up my favorite game of all time would probably not sit well either. Therefore I do recommend that this be bought, but maybe buy it when its on sale.  This review has also been posted  here.  [dfarnand.wordpress.com] "
"One of the best strategy games ever made, but you prohably know that."
'Starcraft 2' - IGN
Wololo
One of the Best and first (played back in early 2000s) RTS games I have ever played.
"Loved this game back in the day, used to play Michi DM all the time. Still an awesome game that stands the test of time."
"Honestly it took me a while if i wanted to say Yes or No to this, they say it is HD but it still looks the same. It is a very old game and i played this alot durring my childhood it is really fun loading into a skermish with friends or just playing the campain. Dont get me wrong its a decent game, but it is not High Definition."
"I've played this game since it originally came out. It's the closest thing to a medieval Starcraft you could ask for. Great graphics, tons of match customization and the historical campaigns are a blast! There are also hundreds of amazing user-created campaigns and maps to discover. 15 years later and I can't get enough of it!"
"The HD remaster is everthing I loved about the original AoE with some added polish, the new AI is a little more challanging than before which does help the game feel fresher and the single player runs really smoothly, even on my barebones laptop. Aside from that most everything else is unchanged which adds some nice nostagia to playing through my favorite campaigns again. The only real issue I have is the shaky multilpayer support. Lag and droputs are way more common than they should be but not enough to ruin the experience of crushing my smack-talking friends over and over."
What can you say about this classic game... I've played since the beginning and love the 500 unit upgrade. 10 for 10
"This game is great, despite its age. I've been playing RTS's forever, and nothing is quite like AOEII. It was the game that started it all for me and it still holds its own very well. Great if you love long matches, and you can really build up your cities and take your time in a game. Very simple, but usually slow and drwan out. Making your own maps is awesome, and the huge 8 player matches are great when you can see the entire map, and the chaos of everyone duking it out.   A fun, yet slow-paced classic."
"Awsome game, loved coming back to the old time classic!!"
One of the best strategi games of all time!! It´s old but still beats many of the new ones still today :)
"I've loved this game ever since it came out. Never really gets old. Plus, the addition of the new skirmish map size is fantastic. my computer has a little trouble running such a massive map, but it's still as fun as ever."
Great game and 1 of the best strategy games ever made!
Steam asked me ' Do you recommend this game? '  yes... ♥♥♥♥ yes 100times yes  I lost my wife for this game my dog found a new owner... my kids got taken off me  and yet i still say yes !
"One of my favourites from my childhood. I’m happy they kept the game as it was, the graphics is absolutely OK for me. The gameplay is just like when i first played, so it worth all the money i spent. Combined with the workshop’s new ideas, soundtracks, graphic pack, there are many new opportunities to increase the feeling."
A graphically updated version of one of my favorite classic games. A solid RTS that I still enjoy!
a timeless classic. worth the money
"A classic timesink of my childhood, and a great RTS with plenty of relatively well balanced options for different play styles. I highly recommend it."
"A flat out amazing RTS game. I played it for years before purchasing the HD version from steam and it was well worth it. While it has its multiplayer issues, it is a fantastic game with lots of content and replayability."
"I would recommend this game if you can get if for a good price. I don't like it that much over the original. Though the AI is better and you get some campaign missions. I didn't like the texture. I expected the texture to be a lot better than what it is now. I get lag when the pop. limit is set to 500. I always play with a pop. limit of 500. I don't know if there is lag at lower limits. The hardware in my gaming rig isn't the issue here. There seems to be some software issue that causes this problem.   After playing for 39 hours I think its worth buying if the price is good, but don't expect too much from this game."
Best RTS of all time.
"if u like strategy games overall pretty good game , the online multiplayer is decent also but kinda lags too 8.5/ 10"
"Probably the worst hd edition ever made, but AOE 2 is still one of the best games ever made. I would only buy it on sale though."
"Outstanding, very proud of how they implemented in game lobby!"
"One of the Best RTS' ever made, age of empires is a classic!"
Very fun game. Lots of stuff to do.
HD could have been done better but its still good.
"Fun,more fun and even more. Great hd remake 10/10. This game will live for the years to come a great stratedy game for all &lt;EVEN YOU&gt;"
One of my first PC games. Fun to play with friends. And tons of mods for graphics and stuff. Grab it on a sale for nostalgic gameplay.
Punched a castle until it caught fire. 10/200 b/c the huns
This is a semi-historic Strategy game with multiple different ways to play the game both as a single player or in a multi-player mode. I think the HD graphics are an improvement. I like the upgrade/research options and the different difficulty options for the AI in this game.
A nice update to the classic game.
The first RTS I ever played is back and it's as good as I remembered it. A great blast from the past.
"A Piece of ♥♥♥♥. Broken beyond all belief, they actually made MP WORSE. They pulled this scheme off with Age of Mythology as well. Stay away"
This just brings back the memories back on msn matchmaking  10/10 would saboteur again
I've been playing AoE II since I was around 6 or 7. I own copies of the entire series and this is a wonderful addition because it brings back a classic with the advantage of the steam network for multiplayer and enhanced graphics. I highly recommend this game to any AoE veteran or newcomer.
"Here's a blast to the past for you! Originally released in 1999 by Ensenble Studios, this game has the player micromanaging the essentials of a growing colonial civilization: collecting resources, building up towns, and fighting for hold of the land.There's a lot of singleplayer campaigns that re-enact historical events and battles, but personally most of the fun is in the Skirmishes. With 13 Renaissance-based civilizations to choose from, the player must quickly construct a town to fend off enemies who also vie for power and territory. As you advance your civilization's age, you are endowed with more powerful upgrades and troops which can turn the tides of battle. Build fast and conquer fast, but don't neglect your own defenses!  If you love strategy games that involve building and managing armies, this is the game for you!"
"Wow.... What can I honestly say. When I saw this game, I was completely overwhelmed with nostalgia and knew in a instant that I needed to download this game; and boy was I impressed. This is a fantastic HD remake of a classic."
Great Game!
"It was working fine at first but now, it just lags.  I'm pretty sure it's not my computer's problem as I can run Dragon Age: Inquisition on full and not lag."
"This is an old RTS-classic. Even after 15 years people still play it, and I know why.  Not going to say too much about it. The goal of the game is to build an empire, gather resources and destroy your opponent. You can fight with or against your friends in teamgames. Most people buy because they used to play it, but it is also recommended for people that don't know this title.  There are a few multiplayer platforms. The first one is obviously on Steam itself, the other one is on voobly where the more advanced players play. I recommend starting in the Steam lobbies before going to the Voobly lobbies, because the level tend to be too high for beginners.  Pro: - Fun campaigns (FE campaigns are quite difficult though) - Fluent gameplay - 'Improved' visuals (even though it's not a big difference) - Multiplayer lobbies (both HD and FE or joined together now) - Mod workshop (after big update) is user friendly  Con: - It's pretty much the same version, but with better visuals. 20 dollars isn't really worth it. I recommend buying it during Steam sales. - Moonwalking soldiers when patrolling - Lag on Steam platform (more often than on Voobly platform)"
Old but gold. One of the best RTS ever. They don't make games like that anymore.
Such a fun game! I played this as a kid and I still love it. My sister and I even tried the multi player. It was a bit laggy but that may have just been the connection so it may be better for others.   What I love is it is never the same game twice. I had one where I wasn't attacking anyone and one of the enemy player came in and started attacking. I was shocked and was totally destroyed.   I 100% reccomend you get this game. You will see many simularities to strategy games of today. It's a load of fun.
"not really a recommendation. All they did was add steam, achievements and made it compatible with new systems.  Bad network code. Good if you want to relive memories of playing when young. super laggy in multiplayer.  Really disappointed."
It works on the newer windows os whice the old game had a hard time doing. It not starcarft but it is a good game and a classic.
"this game is my childhood, i know i was born on the year that the dlc came out :3 but still when i was 3 me and my brother got the frist computer (he was 6) and i watched him play gta san andress lol wtf with that generation, that when i played, i always liked to play rts games like warcraft 3, age of empire 2 or even age of mythology, (i had them on my computer i dont know how). By the way i am not american so yeah i didnt know that much english :3 the funny thing i learnd english from video games. but my fav thing to do on age of empire go to the map editor and create my own army and my rival army, and that still fun thing to do, but now i know how to read that things and how use the terrian and things like that and it more fun when its hd so yeah buy it, i think i got it on bundle but i am not sure i dont remmber -_- stupid me"
"A faithful remastering of the classic game, Age of Empires II gives the player a deeply complex but easy to learn strategy game that guarantees hours of fun. I would recommend this game to any fan of the AoE franchise or a fan of strategy games in general."
IT'S BACK! This game along with Warcraft II and Starcraft DEFINED my childhood.
"For me: One of the best games ever made, it is fantastic that they made this in HD If u like strategy games -&gt; download this :)"
Warning: You may want to kill your friends if they own you in this game. I'm dead serious.
'This game sucks!'  *Wololo*  'This is the best strategy game ever!'  10/10
This worked great. Can you help me with something else? Age of Empires III. Do you have any idea how to get it running using playonmac from Steam? It comes up with an xml error that I can't seem to overcome. It would be awesome to have a guide for that.
"Even after almost 20 years, AOEII HD stands the test of time in solidifying its place as one of the best RTS games of all time. Even if a bit pricey, AOEII HD makes a few meaningful improvememnts such as Steamworks multiplayer and Steam Workshop support that make it worth picking up at a discounted price, because paying 20 dollars for a nearly untouched 20 year game is ludicrous. Steamworks multiplayer works very well, but there is some small, yet noticeable lag when many units are onscreen at once, and the graphical improvements are few and far between. Wololololo? Yes."
You know you want to buy this quallity 1999 High definition shiz.
its goes boo when you type 9/11. never forget. ~Wololo~
"***Please Note that i have played this game for nearly 6 years before purchasing this on steam***    ***General Analasys of the game***   AOE II HD Edition is a Strategy game based in the ancient era, players must collect resources to build their empire and create units that are used to build, and protect you're empire in which you will engage in tremendous battles that if you are a good player will last hours it seems. Players will be able to engage in diplomatic activities such as trading resources for needed ones, (Wood to create houses for iron to create warriors). In the end you will be either a winner or a loser weather you are either of these determines the skill you produce.    ***My opinion on the game***  I highly recommend this game, for the $19.99 you will spend can never amount to the fun you will have while playing this Everything that is in this game is just awesome for it's time, me and my school-mates  Would all join a local server and battle it out as we all ate our lunch, in a group of about 8 or 9 of us would play until we we're defeated then we would log out and the remaining players would keep battling until eventually a winner emerged It's been so long since we did this but the winner got a nice prize for winning and it was usually my good friend Ryan :)  we'd sometimes find ourselves ingulfed in this game to the point the school board took the computers out of our school. This is where it gets a little off topic but im sure you will think this is pretty neat. One day we all came to school stoked on lunch time so we could all see who's been training the most. At about 12:00 PM we all went to the battle-room  This is what we called it :), just to find out that 90% of our computers had been taken away by the school board and only 2 remained with locked passwords so none of us could access it, and anyone who could access it was  indefintely not allowed to play AOE II, so a bunch of young lads we we're bent out of shape by this and one of our teachers who had actually played with us, came forth and encouraged that we played this game, considering it was educational, it gave us a brief understanding of ancient civillizations, and organization. Which i would occasionally speak forth about. Eventually we had a huge debate imploring that they put the computers back, but they thought it had  brought us away from the academic system, only to later find out that it gave us a great understanding of history. With some help from my teacher we ended up getting our computers back, and remained playing AOE II till we had  graduated from the school i was attending.    ***Moral of the story*** This game is 100% worth the hard earned money that you are paying, i would never sit here and tell you otherwise this game gave me confidence in myself and also made me understand that even though you may be the best at something their is always someone better. Which is beautiful i think. So please buy this game because its too good to not buy.     God Speed ladys and gents."
"This is a great game to buy. My ONLY complaint is that ALL the hotkeys that I've come to know and memorize which help in the multiplayer aspect of the game to quickly build and create units have ALL been changed to this 'new' hotkey system - which I don't like simply because it's not how I remember it. If anyone could come up with a patch or something like that to reset the hotkeys to the origninal game's default - then that'd be great.  Other than that, the game is as good (if not better) than the original. And with Steam play, the multiplayer aspect of the game is even easier to use. I'm also impressed to see that they're making an expansion to this vanilla game (the first in 10 years) and that the developers are making an HD version of Age of Mythology. I hope that they'll go so far back as to make an HD version of the very first and original Age of Empires.  All in all, I would purchase this game. It's worth the money and is an excellent nostalgic throw back classic game - reinvisioned for modern platforms. A+"
best rts of all time
"A Fantastic Game, Especially when i was younger it has become a nostalgic throwback for me and the fact it has been revamped to HD Is Awesome, UNFORTUNATLY THIS GAME IS F**KING BROKEN  BROKE-EN  It Randomly crashes to the desktop FOR NO REASON AND ITS NOT A HARDWARE ISSUE many people are having this problem FIX IT OR LET THIS GREA GAME DIE  Other than the balls up of crashing every 5 or 20 minutes, Lets talk about why the game is good, It is a RTS Game in which you grow an empire from the bleak dark ages, from building Farms to castles and much more nd building Vast armies right to the Imperial Ages, Forces clash and Land is taken, AND WITH 500 Different units With like 20 Different Factions you will not run out of stratagies.  The Multiplayer is FANTASTIC The AI Can be good HOWEVER you have to use difficulty HARD or Higher for them to atually attack you on Skirmish Maps anyway  The Campaign is Long and Brilliant, All of them based on Historical Events you go back in time and renact famous historical Events even playing as Heroes such as William Wallace, Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc and many more. You'll find more than a WHOPPING 3 WEEKS OF GAMEPLAY Through the Campaigns ALONE  My FAVOURITE PART IS THE CUSTOMIZATION  The MAP MAKER IS ABSOULUTLY GODLIKE MAP GENERATION IS SUPERB  All in all with this review i dont want to spoil to much ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY THIS GAME  ITS GREAT, i wouldnt recomend it though if you dont like stratagies however.  For its Price and Gameplay WORTH IT   9/10 Fantastic, Hopefully they patch the BUG"
"Age of Empires is a classic strategy game that doesn't age. Everyone is already familiar with it, so you don't need a teaching session before playing with any group of friends. Back in the day it was hard for me to get online multiplayer working, but we used to play AOE 1 and 2 in local network almost ever other day. With Steam lobbies, online finally works the way it should. AOE2HD sets the standard for all Steam re-releases, hopefully others will take notice.  AOE 2 is possibly the best RTS game I know. Only Age of Mythology (and maybe StarCraft to some extent) get even close. WOLOLO."
LOVE this game. I have actually played this game since around 2002. I love having it here on steam and in a new improved version. It is just as engaging as before. If you are into strategy/city building type games you will love Age of Empires.
"Amazing game, a must play. For the price, it is totally worth it. Believe me I played more than just 85 hours, I used to own the game before steam came out."
Beautiful revamp of a classic.
The old classic rts reborn! I spent most of my youth with this game! A pirated edition I must confess! But I bought now for the sake of the old days! Thx MS.
8/10 
"Excellent game, much better then III. New campaigns through extra DLC avaliable keeps the game fresh as before!"
Pretty good.   Trebuches suck.   10/10
Great game. I played this a lot as a kid and it is even better than I remember.
It's simple. It's fun as hell. Looks a lot better than the old disc version. SO GOOD BUY IT!
Enemy team:  About 57 Sword men 71 Archers  War elefants everywhere (About 11) Ships surrounding my island.  My Team: 6 Settlers 3 Archers 1 Transport ship  I made it to another Island and started again  11/10 would start again. 
"A rather disappointing remastering of the late AOE ll due to a few things. Firstly, although all the graphics have been updated to HD, the objects themselves have shrunk and this makes gameplay a little straining. Secondly, there seem to be performance issues whereby stutters become quite common and serious even though this game is not graphics-intensive. Lastly, the little tibits. Where have all the audio voicing gone? Why is the launcher so...sloppily done up? Why is it that the intro-video is absent except for its sound?  But aside from all this, the game itself is still nice to play, with all the legacy campaigns still intact and the new DLC. Just hoping that it could be better. I was really excited when I download AOE ll HD and I stand by that. But it seems to have left a bitter taste."
"Wololo'd 10/10, 8/10 with rice"
"A good game, but I am bit disappointed that sometime during the process of a year patching it 'lost' compatibility with Windows XP, which is what I ve got only. So when I bought it about a year ago, I could play and had fun, but I cant play it after this summer anymore. Buy it, but read the game requirements carefully."
Great Game to play with friends.
"I spent most of the time playing the skirmish mode offline and remembered why I always loved RTS games and the Age of Empires series. AOE II is a good game because playing it makes time fly by. When you think you have played for an hour and it was really three or four, the game must be doing something right. Is the AI perfect? No, but that seems like an issue with every Age of Empires game - and every RTS game I have played. AOE II is very addicting, fun, and recommended!"
Sheep are OP!
Still one of the best games ever made and now easily playable on modern systems with great multiplayer support as well! 10/10
One of my favorite games to play.
AoE II is one of the top ten strategy games of all time and this is a good version of it. I recommend it.
"What can I say - it's nice to be able to play this game again (on my Windows 7 rig) without having to fuss with compatibility settings. Brings back memories of burning countless hours on this game, but now in HD. Making a good review for this game is like re-inventing the wheel... so I'll just say this - looks great playing across three monitors."
Absolutelly worth your money.
"I LOVE THIS GAME ! ! ! ! been playing RTS since i was a kid and this brought back memories... Great game, really balanced"
"I've had this game for only a few days, and it's one of the most fun, addictive strategy games i've ever played. its easy to get into, and you can spend hours playing without realizing it."
It's pretty good
great Game with the new reboot it is alot bettter than before
perhaps the best RTS ever!!!!
11/10 Would buy again.
This is a fun and realistic medievil simulator. You start off with a small group of people and you giude them through a conkerous journey. You are able to swap gametypes and play with friends. This game is packed full of of some awesome feachures such as time consuming buildings witch cost recources. Everyone should play this game i recomend it.
"This game is great! It was nice to switch from having to insert the disc when I wanted to play, to whenever I want! Graphics looks better, and it's just as fun as it always has been. :)"
Best RTS game to date.
"Age of Empires II HD brings back the classic RTS action of AoE, I remember playing this back in High School and to be able to play this again is great, the visuals look good, gameplay is solid and overall is good value."
"AoK is an amazing classic RTS. I am so glad they decided to bring an updated version out on Steam. The new release has allowed me to finally play this game with friends after so many years. As for the game itself, I really enjoy the style of gameplay AoE has. The balance of siege and infantry make for an interesting match. I have never been one for playing RTS games, but AoE is the one series I play and will continue to play.  There are a few issues with the HD version however. The update is nice, but at the same time rather minimal. If you are looking to find a game that is vastly improved over the original I would look elsewhere. Online works and makes setting up games extremely simple, but there are connection and latency issues. I also am happy that Forgetten was able to be ported to HD; the pricetag on a free expansion(origanally) stings, but I am willing to overlook that since it did add a fair bit of content. Overall I would recommend AoE II HD to everyone."
finaly in HD!
Love it. Keep it up guys
all time best
"Simply the best game EVER made!  Ahh... It feels like I'm back in my childhood, so many good memories! Nothing bad to say about this one :)"
"This is it, this is it. One of my favorite child-age games. I played this game a long-long time age and still found it as one of my favorite game.  Thanks for releasing it!"
A classic. Even better in 2560x1440 resolution!
"Age of Empires II is the very first video game I ever played and it remains my favorite game till today. The aesthetics, history, complexity of this game had me hooked to it for nearly 15 years. And this new HD version obviously kept all the original games charm since it's virtually the same. But there are a few very nice new features that I enjoyed immesely.  What I like best about the HD version is the steam workshop support. Mods can be conveniently applied to the game, I had a few graphic textures installed to my version and it totally revitalized the experience.  The Forgotten expansion is a bit rough on the edges in the beggining, but with almost a monthly update it is getting better and better. In time I think all the new content added to the game, such as new civilizations, new campaigns, new units would match the quality of the first expansion: the Conquerors.  I have never played multiplayer in the past, now with steam support I did try a few games, and it is very user friendly to say the least, I might do that more in the future.  In summary what I love about this game and this HD version is that it brought a ture classic game back to life, it brought a generation of gamers who love this game together. I would recommend this game to anyone who have played AOE2 in the past, who is open-minded to classic strategy games, and people who love ancient civilizations. Age of Empires 2 is one of those rare experience that never grows old and keeps getting better. No game has ever impacted me as much and no other game ever will.  "
This game still rocks after all these years!
"Love this game, i used to play it with my friend all the time. Our parents litterally had to turn of the breakers in the basement to get us off it haha"
Just as good as I remember it back in the day. Now Can only review this as a 'Casual' gamer as I don't have much interest in the competetive scene. The price might be a little steep but if you used to love the original. There is no way you won't imediatly fall in love again.
"Probably the best strategy game ever made. The controls aren't as easy to use as newer games like starcraft 2, but the gameplay is amazing. Glad to see they made a version that runs on never versions of windows and with texture packs and active online mode!"
Classic strategy game.  I love a game that lets me choose who I am and reap the rewards of that decision. Like Byzantinian walls.
"Best game of all time! I highly, very highly, recommend!!!!"
Love it just Great
Good Game to play single player...
Age of Empires 2 was an absolutly brilliant game and when it came out it set the tone on how RTS's were meant to be done. Few games even come close to this and even now it remains one of the best RTS in existance.
"Great Game obviously, though there has to be an update soon, in which the serious multiplayer flaws get dealt with."
"We all love it when the classics of our childhood end up on Steam.  Age of Empires II in HD. No longer do flaming buildings look like buildings with paper flames pasted on them. The graphics are better, and the DLC has new civilizations."
"This remastered version of Age of Empires is great if you played it before it was available on steam. New players may have a hard time with multiplayer because it's very skill based, so noobs don't have a good shot at winning games. If you're a big time RTS person though you could still pick it up and give it a shot. If you read guides, play a lot of single player, and watch games, you could be good enough to find multiplayer enjoyable. In general this game is a lot less complicated than games like Civ, but rich enough to give room for lots of strategies and fun. Games can last hours, but seem really fast paced to me. The biggest advantage to having this game on steam is the ease of multiplayer. The original is over 10 years old, so the multiplayer with that is real shotty and hard to do sometimes. Steam makes it a lot easier to make a lobby and play with friends, but playing with random people is normally an issue because the anonymous multiplayer is normally kind of dead. Other than making the multiplayer a bit better through steam, the next best thing is the game runs good in modern operating systems which used to be a problem for me with the old one. A last big plus is the steam workshop. Other than those things, the HD reboot is really not that different than the original. The graphics are hardly different/better compared to the ancient original, but you can download good texture packs in the workshop. Multiplayer through steam still has some issures. TLDR: Pick it up if you're a fan of the series or a big RTS fan."
"Grew up playing this game and somehow lost my disk about 10 years ago. Thankfully some smart person Thought 'Hey, let's bring back AOE2 and Remaster it'  To whoever had the idea to remake it: 'THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK MY CHILDHOOD. Also..... WOOLLOOLOOO'  10/10"
Love it! Fun to play!
It's a classic. And the expansion just makes it even better. Great game!!! Keep up the goodwork.
Great RTS game placed in the middle ages. Though lack of adjustment for video quality may cause complications.
"Don't get me wrong, the game is very good. However the optimalization is very bad and there isn't much people playing. It's better to just find your old copy and play online on voobly with unofficial hd community patch (google it). Tons of players, very competetive with elo system.  Anyway, if you already have the game, don't buy it, it's waste of money."
best game ever try to downloade resorece packs the game well be better
"Honestly, this is one of my favorite games on Steam. When i was younger, i spent countless hours playing the original Age of Empires. I built 100s of maps (no matter how cheesy or lame) and played countless games against my sister.   This game plays fairly similar to the original and thus, brings back lots of exciting and fantastic times. The second i discovered there was a remastered version of this game in steam, i purchased without a single doubt in my mind. I truly love playing this game and WOULD RECOMMEND to any true RTS lovers as well as those who dont play very many RTSs."
cool
its kinda like call of duty.
"All the greatness of AoE2 only with a functioning multiplayer, even has some addition features that make it even better then the original (increased pop)! 10/10 will play again! Such game, much impress!"
Issues with lag in Multiplayer. Good game nevertheless.
I really like that they updated the graphics for today's machines. it really makes a difference.
"Not really much needed to say about this classic strategy Titan. After more than a decade, still very exciting title to play.."
"I love AoE2. It has been one of my most favourite games since i was just a wee lad. So seeing this updated version with a couple of extra expansion packs it, well it brings a tear to my eye. Highly recommend and get the gift pack to give to friends its deffinatly worth it."
"Just as much fun as I remember it being as a kid, this is for anyone who is a fan of classic RTS."
It's an old Classic remade into a new medium. Nothing more to be said.
A classic strategy game that'll have you hooked for hours on end. It's not easy though so be prepared to rage quit a few times.
"Awesome game, enough said!!!"
Wololo
"Friends: 'Hey, wanna play Ages of Empires II?!' Me: 'Ah, don't you mean you want to play Chop Wood Simulator?'"
"While an amazing game I would try to find it on Disc via an updated version. The QA people missed a lot of issues made in the port. The Joan of Arc levels are particulary annoying. Love the game, but don't like for steam."
Quite pretty :)  To pass the time with friends :) 
Awsome Strategy game! 10/10!
A worthy remake of a classic game. This makes it simple and easy to find players once again to enjoy some of the best RTS action every invented. One of my favorite games.
"Awesome game with a great soundtrack! It's even better if you played the original, but if you havn't... That's fine. It's still a fun game with historically correct characters, locations and so on. Worth every penny.  "
One of the best RTS games that I have ever played!
"I love AOE2 but HD are so damn laggy, cant even play the game for the FPS Drop..... plz help me if you know how to fix it plz."
"As a person who has never played AoE before... I got addicted with it very quickly and have played many hours in the first few weeks, although i'd say the graphics are 'old school' they do not need improving what so ever it is the consistent FPS and low latency that is needed to fully enjoy this game  With a high number of missions and a very active online community it will keep you going for a long time to come.   Easy to get into and can start learning the advanced techniques in a short time   10/10 must have"
"A game I never dreamed would be remade, and which I frankly never expected to be able to play again thanks to Windows 7's penchant for screwing with older color palette-based games. Not only does the wonderful second expansion add new factions and campaigns, but the multiplayer is better than ever, running on Steamworks servers for online play and utilizing modern LAN protocols for those who wish to host LAN parties. Additionally, this game utilizes the Steam Workshop, so one may expect boundless community-created content in the near-future, a unique facet of PC gaming that was once long-forgotten but now seems to be experiencing a sort of Renaissance thanks to such services as the Workshop. Revisit old memories and make new ones with this excellent HD reimagining. I can't recommend this title highly enough.  Addendum: Now, if only Gearbox will do half as well with their Homeworld remakes..."
Its nice
Definitely the best strategy game out there!
this is the game that kick started my love for RTS games also was the first game i ever played. the peautiful sound of hundreds of knights and soldiers steamrolling towards a helpless cowards base still rings in my ears and takes me back to when i first played this.i never gave a game a full rating in my life but...this one is an exception.yes its an old game (its from the 90s) but it will live on as a legend.BEST..GAME..EVER  10/10-Pootis the Communist Pyro
"yeah its pretty good, been playing it since i was 4 with age of empires 1 being one of my first games, would get on steam aye"
I got the game when it first came out and remember going to my grandma's to play the very first one. I'm glad they have finally come out with an expansion.
10/10 One of the best games I have ever played!!!
Stand at the edge of your computer table and get down in a wrestlers squat and shove this game up your ♥♥♥. Nothing HD about it. If you buy this a set of donkey nuts will swing down and hit your chin.
Old school gaming. Everything is exactly the same. Just better colors. Couldn't ask for more.
It's so gud
brings back memories
"this game is not so entertaing as the age of empires 2, but their is a major improvement in the graphics and game play"
It's a Classic!
"It's a great time, I think it would be worth it even at $30.00."
Best strategy game of all time. Few games can still hold up to their genre counterparts years after their release but this game does.
Just like I remembered it 10 years ago! So happy they kept it nearly exactly the same.
10/10 it's ok
"Brings back one of my favorite childhood games, and for the most part, it's just as great as I remember! Sometimes the pathfinding is a bit off, and there seems to be a delay for some commands that can be a little tricky during combat situations, but for the most part this HD version is a good reboot of the classic RTS. I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed the original AoE2 or anyone who enjoys RTSs and would like to play one of the greats of the genre, though to be honest, it's kind of hard to believe that a RTS fan would have not played this game."
love this game classic!
"Greatest game I have ever played. I have to have logged at least 2,000 hours playing this game over the course of a decade."
"THIS GAME. If you like RTS, then this is the game for you, I would, however, like to tell you that you must first learn game mechanics before playing, it makes the game a whole lot more interesting. I made the mistake of not knowing how the game works at first so I was pretty upset about how everyone raided me in no time flat. In the end I did go through a guide and it really helped me. All in all, totally worth 4 keys for the entire bundle :D"
"This game was formative in my childhood/teen years! My entire family played it constantly! When I found AOE Online, I played some of that, but this is the real deal. It looks nice, sounds nice, and I'm enjoying the Forgotten civilizations and campaigns. A nice update to graphics and compatibility for new computers. If you enjoyed it originally, there's a lot here to bring you back!"
Lots of fun .....Just buy it. Love the HD graphics from the original game. Fun team game
"Very funny large map game, although it can be repetitive it keeps you hooked as you atempt to conquer your opponents in warfare."
"One of the best PC games ever made...  Informative, Educational, Well-balanced, Great graphics and aesthetics."
LOVE IT
"Greatest RTS of all time, a masterpiece."
"Better then Starcraft 2, this game is so hard to master that in all my years of playing i still suck. I Feel its Mecanicis are much more comp;lex and compleeing then most Rts, i dont feel i do anything the same ever due to the different Civs and there strong points. where as i feel that Sc is more of your basic chess game."
"I suck but it was still kinda fun, until the AI obliterated me with unjust fury the likes of man has never seen before. Still might be better with friends."
Was great until it started crashing. This needs to be fixed or I want my money back
"Great game, would recommend to any strategy gamer "
It's good to see that this game has aged well. Good for nostalgia and for an all around good time.
Great classic remade and nothing taken from the original. simply awesome.
"Just like the original, but much improved!"
"This one is a throwback to my early years as a gamer. It's a very steep price point at $19.99 and not worth it unless you are a real fan of the series. That being said, it’s nice to see new light shed on this fantastic classic. They have upped the population to 500 and made adjustments to the graphics of the game. It also has all the critter comforts that come along with steam (steam overlay, trading cards, and achievements). It is also much easier to start up a game with your friends as well as strangers since the servers for the original game were shut down in 2006. Have fun and RAIDING PARTY!"
The old school with new paths i cant never forget this game
"Even though it is an older game at this point, AoE II is still as good, or better than most of the RTS games being made today. And now available in a format that works on newer machines, one that supports cheat-free multiplayer. AoE II HD is a must own for RTS players."
Great classic revamped game. One of my favourite games of all time
If you don't get this you are a sad person.
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle? 
"Its Age of Empires 2, but in HD - what more do you need to know? The classic game, now with good multiplayer support, so get ready to crush your friends with monks and archers!  The price is a bit steep, so buy the 4-pack if you got friends whos into it!"
One of the best RTS games ever! The remake finnaly runs on Windows Vista and later.
I am a big RTS fan and love the age of mythology series AoEII HD is an updated version of the clasic for those who enjoy RTs games or roleplaying with freinds in the multi player i would recomend this game for you
Best strategy game ever I got it when it first came out and still playing it today
a pretty good retro
"Amazing game, but this HD edition barely adds anything. Not worth getting if you already have the original AoE 2."
Nostalgia polished and set. It's wonderful.
"Great Game! I like it more than AoeIII by FAR. This game is just a classic and is way more in depth that AoEIII, even though is not HD but more of an HQ version, still looks great and works very good, a few things here and there but anything to worry about. The only thing that I didn't like was that they removed LAN, thats how I expected playing it the most, but yet I've had a lot of fun playing this game"
it wopnt update to 3.3 for me
"I felt it worth buying simply because this is one of my favourite ever games from my childhood, and any sort of expansion to it is worthwhile to me. Though the high definition graphics are brilliant, there are issues, in that the controls feel a little antiquated. Civilization expectedly makes this game feel pretty old.  If you're a fan of the game it's definitley worth getting, especially is you buy the Forgotten expansion pack too. But it depends solely on the price. I only felt right buying it when it was on sale, but full retail price of £15 (ignoring the Forgotten expansion which will set you back £23) just isn't worth it. I'd give it a yes simply due to my sentimental attachment to the series that got me into strategy gaming."
An excellent update to the single-best RTS game of all time.
Good stuff. Just like I remember it when I played it years and years ago.
wololo in HD
"Still a great game, and the Steam updates have made it even better."
I would like a refund for the game because my computer does not support this game.
"This game was my first game ever, the original not HD edition of course, and it's what started my life of video gaming. I don't think I'd be as into games as I am now if I hadn't played this game when I was about eight or so years old. The graphics aren't the best for this generation of games, but back in windows 98 this game looked beast. I would recommend this game to all my friends as a must play at some point. It's a fun strategy game that hasn't lost it's luster."
"same old classic, I love it"
"A alltime classic, no pre-history games over or the sides. [17.3/20]"
"Age of Empires. What more needs to be said? Strategize the ♥♥♥♥ out of your friends and no more trouble with uhm connecting with your friends on LAN, for we're all connected on steam now."
Best Age Of Empires of all + Multiplayer. Great game.
I really enjoyed playing this game! its so adictive!!!
"Same game as the original, with just fancier water. All original bugs still exist, they could have tried harder."
"Retro 1990's game where you build your civilisation up using villagers to gather resources food, wood, gold and stone. Advancing through ages is fun, but the fights along the way more so!   Played this about 13 years ago, then came back to it in 2010 and enjoyed it as much as i did back in the days!! TImeless game you have to own. Personally owned AOE II HD for 2 weeks and played 40+ hours!"
Old school game but never gets too old. If you are an Age of Empires series fan then you must get this.
"Definatley worth it Age of empires II was and still is the perfect medieval strategy game, and after many years a patch is included!"
"The memories i've made playing this game when it was first released are countless. So many good times playing against the A.I. or just playing with friends over LAN. It's nice to have this game in HD though, where it fits my monitor great. I still own the box version of this game as well, it sits on top of a shelf right behind me. I recommend this game for lovers of the original or newcomers alike!"
"Age of Empires. We all know that game, right? It was what got us into online gaming and RTS. Races are  almost  carbon copies of one another so it is not as deep as, say, StarCraft. But it was fun 10 years ago and is still fun now. Nice addition to the AoE family. And may the WOLOLO be with you."
Great game
An old game but still great!
"this is the game that brings back all the good old time memories. this is THE party game back in the days gota say although the graphics do not live up to the 'HD' standard, but its definetly one the those games that you should pack in your libreray"
One of the best games of all times. The re-release in HD is the proof of the never-diminishing popularity of this classic.
Excellent game. The HD graphics are not the HD but are far superior to the orignal. Would recommnd to all.
A classic. Out of 5.
Just as good as the original version!
"love the game, played it when i was young, and willl continue to play it."
Playing AOE2 HD I'm back in my 18th and it's fantastic comback ;-).
Nice job with the resolution!
"This game is basicly the first comming of civ. Woth it, you wont regret buying this amazing work of the gods."
"Great game, buy."
Great game. Brings back memories from my beginnings in the RTS world. I would tell anyone to pick up this game for the price tag on it and see where it all began.
This game is a classic. Will forever love this game. It still to this day is a game i come back to. Must have.
"Classic game, Can't beat it :)"
Great game. Very fun.
Age of Empires is a classic and still very addictive im happy I purchased the game
old stye game for nostalgia only :)
"I enjoyed it 10 yrs ago, and still love it."
THE GREATEST ♥♥♥♥ING COMPUTER GAME OF THE 90S
A timesink that I've lost days into.
"I like this version of Age of Empires the best. It pretty much forces you to develop your civilization a bit before the 'big battle' that eventually ends the game. So, it is fun just to play with friends, even if you don't win in the end."
Probably my favorite real-time strategy game ever. I would recommend this game over the third addition of Age of Empires.
This is one of the best! Happy to see in HD and hope that all of bugs such as lags with big population on multiplayer are fixed :-)
Absolutely fantastic.
"Oldschool, but still fun."
"Always a Classic, good game"
"I would fully recommend getting this to anyone who enjoys strategy games. Now that obvious bit is over, onto the steam version of this classic game.  I again would recommend all people who enjoyed the game since it first came out to get this mainly for system/graphical reasons. I found that on Windows 7 when i installed from the disk version of Age of Empires II (which i still have even in 2013) it didn't fit the screen properly and there was some colouring issues. That simply comes from the age of the game. However with this edition all of those small bugs were fixed, and indeed while the graphics havn't been changed at all so it still feels like the original game, HD is a good term for this version as it all just feels sharper compared to the non steam version. The expansion that is steam release alone has given me enjoyment aswell, with a good couple of campaigns and new factions there (though I'm still trying to figure out a few new features which I read in the campaign but can't find in skirmish).   Overall, can't really fault the game on steam as it's exactly what it says it is; Age of Empires II. However, I'd suggest getting this while on sale, because £15 seems a bit excessive for a game of this age. With the new campaign included in that price I would find it reasonable. I managed to pick up AoE III the complete edition, AoE II HD AND the Forgotten expansion this Christmas sale for £7.49. I don't recommend getting AoE II alone for anything above that, especially as the extra content isn't included."
"Fun to play with friends, but the games get a little on the too long side for me. But recommended to buy on the cheap days of Sales"
"This is a much better game than the metacritic score suggests; it is worthy of being praised as one of the greatest RTS games. This is not just a game, it is an experience. Just buy it, its been on sale for about 3-5 dollars at times.  This is an excellent remastering of an eternal game. Having played hundreds of battles in the original version, I can certainly say that this is the definitive version. Included are many things that improve the experience, many being subtle, such as the addition of a palisade gate building. Although some of the additions are minor, it allows for fuller, more immersive gameplay.  The five new civilizations included with 'The Forgotten,' are well implemented and only add scope and content to an already brilliant game. The new civilizations also come with all new building designs; this adds a nice aesthetic."
Probably my fav game of all time
Do you want to cheat to win? Buy this game.
"WOLOLO!  The same as before, but better, with higher resolution and mods. My only gripe is that you use to be able to shift + click multiple locations to have your units scout, you can still, but you have to end the chain of clicks with a simple right click, which is odd."
"All Hail! King of the Losers! Start the game already! Monk, I need a monk! Nice town. I'll take it. Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already! Start the game already!"
"The game of my childhood remastered in HD with multiple new features such as: Population increase, Steam workshop, and easier multiplayer exerpience all around. Definantly a good purchase if you are a fan of RTS games. I give it a 5 out of 5."
This is the game we all know and loved 12 years ago with just improved graphics and a fully functional multiplayer. By far one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.
30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30
"This game is a timeless classic, easy to learn and an amazing time with friends!"
Age of Empires 2 was my first computer game and is still one of my all-time favorites.
"Age of Empires II is one of those classics that never get old. It is a great game and one of the first RTS I have ever played excluding aoe1 of course. I would recomend this game to ANYONE who enjoys a timless classic or a great RTS. One of if not my favourite games in my library of 250+ games lol. The mod support, texture packs and other add-ons are amazing. What are you waiting for? GET IT!"
Wonderful Game if you enjoy rts games. Very fun to play with friends as well.
Great game to play with friends.
The best Strategy game ever. Read Critic reviews for understanding the low rate/score.  Old but gold.
Love this olde. The remastered version of this game vastly improves performance and looks. I would say get this game if you love RTS and love to feel your army getting stronger and stronger as you play
❤
"This game was my first RTS love, and I have to say it aged surprisingly well. The strategic depth it truly impressive, even compared to modern RTS games. Further, I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was still a vibrant multiplayer community. Using the game's built in MP lobby browser I've never had to wait more than 3 or so minutes to find a game.  I would definitely recommend to anybody who likes deep, tactics focused RTS games."
finaly i was waiting for a remake 
"Excellent little game, All the great things from the original except now in HD! Fantastic."
"Nostalgia to the max. Nice update on graphics . There are bugs sometime (ex. buildings stacking or not properly, units not taking straightest path from A to B). Multiplayer work well, better than original. Fun new campaigns and great to have the old ones too. Overall: It was a grat game, still is."
"This game, while being over 13 years old (or something like that), is still totes awesome!"
Nice game !
Im so happy they renewed this game and the GF are so much better. :)
I enjoy this game.
a classic game that is kept alive through this HD re-release. now if only they bring age of mythology to steam
"Nice re-make from the original, Love it, recommend for anyone who enjoys the original or similar games"
Great strategey game and fun w/ friends .
Really cool with friends i would think. Probably one of my most played games back in the day
So HD I thought I was in the game.  10/10
It's all right.
"Age of Empires II is thee best strategy game ever created. Its timeless graphical style will never make this game look dated. Deep and wonderful game systems have been attempted to be emulated by other games and even by the franchise. Yet nothing has reached the epic proportions this game has achieved.  All in all, if you want a deep and engaging strategy game. Easy to pick up, hard to master. This one is for you. A rock solid 10/10"
i am not a gamer. i thuoght i would be safe buying a game from steam i love age of empires 2 i paid 30 dollars to get teased every time i play it is great and xsiteing. and locks up or kicks out to steams crap adds! f you steam. the lest cent spent. thanks for the heads up.
Great being able to bring this classic back into my life. Fantastic playing with friend also a great introduction or reintroduction into the RTS style
"The classic game we all loved, updated for modern hardware and OSs."
This is a game
24
This game is straight Dopamine homie.
Brought back so many memories..really like the huge map and 500 population increase..that was a really needed upgrade from 200
"Classic game in HD, plus now with added content, great game and now easy to play again with friends, would recommend for epic battles with friends, be warned, good games can last for hours.  Monopoly has got nothing on this game in time consuming XD"
good games never get old and age of empires was and stil is a truly great game !
75+ hours and I've not even started the campaigns...
"yeah it sucks hard, just a rip off of age of empires 2."
Sucks the time away from you.
"Age of Empires 2 HD is such a marvel to behold. The gameplay is seemless and it has loads of options and things to do in the game, warfare has never had it so good, until now. If you love these kind of strategy games as much as I do, then you cannot go wrong with a fine game like this so is, a brilliant series is Age of Empires and this is the icing on the cake, when it comes to cool strategy games, full marks from me! 10/10 awesome..."
Great Old Skl RTS
Lets face it this classic never gets old.
"One of my favorite stratergy games of all time. An absolute classic. Great single player campaign, and fantastic multiplayer."
"After many years, Microsoft have remade this Ancient Classic in to HD.  Age of Empires where you build your Armies and roam across to land to take over your competition in barbaric ways is a ton of fun.  If you want to know what type of games people played in the early 90s play this game. This was a master piece and still is a master piece with a downloaded content, which is a master piece with a gold badge. ;)"
"I'm going to admit, I'm disappointed that the metascore on this game is so low, and I'm especially disappointed at the people who put it at that low spot. This game is amazing; a classic piece of gaming from a bygone age when developers actually cared about the players who enjoyed their games and made the content perfect in every way. Age of Empires introduced me to gaming as a whole, and I'm proud to say that I am still a big fan of the series for over 10 long and enjoyable years.   If you are reading this, do us all a favor and ignore the metascore. Buy the game. Even if you aren't good at Real Time Strategy, this game is a piece of history and is well worth the buy. Developers and publishers alike need to take a leaf out of the page of old Ensemble Studios and start making Real Time Strategy games with this kind of quality."
Good stuff. The graphical upgrades are big swag.
"Very good game, I still enjoy it years later. Although I enjoy and 'miss' some of the old textures it runs well and extremely fun if you want to play campaign or multiplayer."
"The best RTS you could play. Hasn't aged a bit,"
"This game in my honest opinion is exactly what players should expect from a strategy game, easy to learn, hard to master, and it's incredibly affordable considering the amount of content it comes with, not to mention the multiplayer revamp allowing easier joining and teaming up. Worth the money, and your time."
best thing to ever come from microsoft.
"Plus for fixed multiplayer, but not much else different past that. If they add more features it's worth it, but not quite so much right now.  EDIT: New expansion pack released, looks pretty cool but I haven't tried it yet. Still probably worth it for a trip down nostalgia lane for $5 and working mp with friends."
"Solid game. Much easier than keeping up patches on the old version, and online community present. Pretty cheap on Steam sales for 75% off too."
"This game is much better than Age of Empires III, it is alot more in depth than the third one. I would suggest you buy it, it's worth the money in my opinion.... it is one great game! "
"My favorite RTS game. It's really cool seeing a game that came out 10 years ago getting new DlC, not to mentioned the added bonus of steam achievements and trading cards. Now they just need to put Star Wars Galatic Battlegrounds on Steam."
good graphics :D
"Great Game, Good Graphics, WALALOOOOOO."
"Good little game, still as good as it was 14 years ago. It would be nice to have some graphical options. But still very fun to get back into playing."
"What is there to say? It's Age of Empires, and if you liked it before, you'll like it now."
One of the best RTS games of all time. I dare you to find another game that's so amazing like AoE II.
So I can't play any of the games or senarios... Can I get a fix? I unistalled and reistalled and it still gave me the same errors. I would also appreciate a response this time and not to be ignored like every other time I ask you people for help. I honestly think the Obamacare people are better at tech support than you guys -_-
One of my favorite games. This will always be a classic!
I am having a problem loading this game loads to 1% then has error 41. Will not load. After windows 10 updated. All other games are working ok?
"&gt;Be me &gt;Host solo game on Aeg of impoors 2: YEE YEE  &gt;Set to have 2 original AI as enemies &gt;'me is strong. me is smart' I say &gt;Start gayme &gt;Both AI are already in the Feudal Age &gt;wtf.jpg &gt;Finally progress to Feudal Age &gt;See 2 messages pop up &gt;'Toriel Le ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has advanced to teh Imperial Age' &gt;'Randy Orton has advanced to teh Imperial Age' &gt;Both AI are taking over &gt;*sweats nervously* &gt;spaghetti sauce starts dripping from my pockets &gt;Another message &gt;'Randy Orton is RKOing your villagers' &gt;whole chair is covered is spaghetti &gt;knees weak, palms sweaty &gt;'Toriel Le ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is reking your sh*t' &gt;nononononononono.exe &gt;ankle deep in spaghetti &gt;village gets rekt &gt;only survivors are the villagers that their monks converted to their side &gt;10/10 would get rekt again"
"Classic Age of Empires II HD has all the elements of the orginial game plus more. Worth the buy especially during this winter sale. Great time killer, fun campaign, and good 'replayability'"
The most awesome game ever ! &lt;3
"The nostalgia really comes creepin' in on me when I play this game. And the best part is that it's one of the few old games I can still enjoy as a good game, rather than  just  a nostalgia-game.  If you're fond of strategy games, this is really a game for you."
"been playing this game for 15 years, i still love it though. there has been a lot of games made in the shape of this game. 10/10. would get slaughtered by the turks 1 more time"
-Allows you to make old AI and updated AI fight against each other on the same map. -Updated threading and multiprocessor usage that allows for massive calculations for more exciting experience. -The fires animations looks more real -The water looks more real.  
"Yes, Yes, YES. this is perfect! there is no reason that it shouldn't be bought, it fixes alot of bugs and makes it easy to set up multiplayer, AND they're adding new content."
"Best RTS ever, and now its back, better than ever!"
"An awesome remake of the Classic but very solid Age Of Empires II, totaly worth having and playing."
"A true classic. This version is unfortunately buggy, and the Steam achievements are horribly designed, but it's still the same great experience. Get it when it's on sale if you like the original."
Simply superb.An actual RTS ♥♥♥ kicker from the 90s.A real treat for history lovers too.People if you read the Encyclopedia on this thing you can Ace your history exam.Buy it play it!
"This is one of the great RTS titles of our time. Many campaigns, scenarios, and other treats await you with this game. Including the upcoming expansion, 'The Forgotten', you'll have access to over 20 civs, each with their own (dis)advantages, unique tech, abilities, and units. As well as 13 campaigns, scenario editor, and upgraded multi-player. Population caps have increased since the original release, going from 200 to a whopping 500 units. The enemy AI has also been upgraded exponentially.  If you like RTS games, you'll definitely love this one."
"Brings back memories, to say the least. Unfortunately, in my opinion it's incredibly underrated and it still offers GREAT replayability and hours of entertainment, which alot of games today simply can't deliver. A must buy for any strategist or AoE fan. Even a bunch of friends who never played the game is going to love it!"
"Worth the discount, since i've already owned this game and paid it full long ago, gained as a christmas present when i was child. I think it's a nice 'upgrade'. It is so epic and has no successors, being the first high quality RTS of its era, and no one has ever reached its depth and longevity. Mechanics are easy to understand, hard to master. Workshop support and steam multiplayer make this release even more juicy with a possibility to acquire an expansion, which i remember was free back in time when the HD version wasn't released. Nevermind, i'm not saying that developers don't deserve a payback because as far as i remember Forgotten Empires introduced the idea of playing an HD 'stable' (wasn't really) version, without any explorer.exe glitch, even adding more civilizations and reworking units, graphics, already existing civilizations, giving more life to a game which has been released 14 years ago."
I like this game! IT IS A LEGEND!
why the game wont running in my pc? pls someone help me
one of the best strategies ive ever played.
"Easily one of the best RTS games of all time. They still sell this one is walmart, thats how good it is.  Multiplayer simply cant be beat in my opinon."
Awesome game! Tons of fun to play with friends! Lots of different ways to win and different empires. I recommend.
Since childhood I have played this great game and let me tell you it is one of the best games I've played in my life and the best RTS I've ever played. Now with this HD version we can play this legendary title to large resolutions like those with screens today.
"Thank you for bringing this game back, the nostalgia and memories are priceless. Funny how a game this old still provides hours of fun.  - (Unit AI needs to be improved)"
.
"Played this game since i was a kid, now, they even have the HD !"
"Very cool game, back then i played it on my PS2 and I sucked rly hard now i still do but in HD."
"I think it is quite needless to say, that this game has been amazing ever since its first release. It is a joy to see this game in steam. Hours of fun are guaranteed, patience to win online games needed (if you are an average player as I am) but in the end it's nothing more than an old classic that has remained an old classic!"
"Very fun game, if you have the money I would say just get it."
Great game!
Possibly the best strategy game of all time!
All time classic! A must-have for real time strategy lovers.
"I grew up on the Age of Empires franchise. My brother and I would skirmish against each other and I would always lose to his rush of cavalry. Even so, I love this game. I have always and will always continue to play it. The game is great if you truly love RTS. It's one of the games that set the standards for all other RTS games on the market. Just don't be fooled by the 'HD' tag. In this case, the 'HD' in (Age of Empires II HD) merely means that it's optimized for the modern generation of computers rather than giving the game modern textures. The only difference I have noticed is a slightly different water texture that is a little more updated for the times. But don't let that deter you! This game is one in a million. It's a MUST-HAVE in your collection."
"Retro is good. If you liked it before, you'll still do. One of those legends!   Such shame the online game has still some major issues I ran into: constant lag made it simply unplayable (tried different hosts). I have to point out not everyone has these issues."
"A classic RTS with base building, unit teching and resource gathering. Great all-around and well balanced."
"One of my favorite strategy games from when I was young, other than C&amp;C, but this is great, I can now play it on my computer without visual glitches and there are new campaigns with the new expansion. I would highly recommend this to any owners of the orriginal AoE 2."
"What's not to like. Hard to beat classics like this. Wasn't quite as HD as I was expecting, but it looked a bit better in windowed mode rather than full-screen. I'll probably be reloading the origninal in a a little bit to see how they compare."
Its a classic. Hands down a experience everyone should have. There is absolute nothing bad I have to say about this game. It is a bit expensive for its age but you could always grab it on sale.
"Age of Empires is a classic among PC games, and while still played widely today it was starting to show its age - e.g. low framerate cap, poor networking support, no high resolution support. The HD edition updates the game to meet modern standards making it better than ever before. Recommended both for newcomers and those who played the original when it first came out."
brings back that great childhood feeling. one of the more relaxing Real time stratagy games and a good game for all ages.
What else is there to say. Age of empires II has been one of the best RTS games ever made. And now you can enjoy it in HD. Enough said
A great reboot. It's amazing to play the game again after so many years. Good to see a lot of people playing it too.
If you were a fan of this game you're gonna be in love with this hd + online version.
A great RTS brough into the modern age.
"a quick review.  notable cons: it's not a game designed for progression which in my case is a letdown as i feel the need to constantly get stronger, richer and so forth. it's very time consuming because every game takes 1 hour minimum while it can taken multiple hours in other cases. pro: can't really say i have something in specific to say, everything about the game is just fantastic and i would deffinitly recommand it. it's old but yet fun to play either solo or with friends.  overall i would say it's well worth the cost, even without a discount, with a discount on steam or buying from a site designed from it you could get countless hours of possibility and gameplay for a minimum cost.  i shouldn't forget to mention there are a few expansions aswell but the game is playable without as it allready provides enough content by itself and in my opinion the expansions are only for thos who truelly love the game and have played it and feel it's time for an 'expansion' haha, you see what i did there? oh nevermind me... have fun!"
On the rare occasion I get a break from my duties at UNATCO I play AOE HD. My augmentations are useless in this game.
A wonderful game that honestly still holds up today. This version fixes SO many problems that we would have at LAN parties with the original on modern hardware.
Amazing game. Takes me right back playing this :D
Great game...wish they would make new one...
would recommend this for anyone who was into AOE 1&amp;2 back in the day. Fantastic work was put into putting the graphics which blew me away
"well this game is pretty good, but lacks good multiplayer support. multiplayer mode can be very laggy but singleplayer and campaign it's fun. this HD edition allows you to run on high resolution (1920x1080) and with decent graphics, however this game is mostly CPU efficient. great strategy game that let's you build and design your own kingdom, and having combat of hordes of soldiers, i can recommend this game.  my score: 6 out of 10."
"Once a true king of the strategy genre and even concidered one of the first to really capture the crowd. AoE is back in a new suite, all HD and good to look at! But even better is the feeling of nostalgia and how fun it is to play it again after so long. Truly one of best real-time-strategy games ever made. And now it even has achievements!"
"I loved this game when it was originally released. I have since been playing it every few years. This copy works great with Win 8.1 no issues whatsoever. I find the game pretty much flawless. Just to let everyone know, they have re created the mutiplayer system, so it just finds other steam players with this game. No more LAN option."
"It holds up, so 5/5 in my book."
"A really classic game! I played it for hours when i was younger (oh boy, i'm getting old ;-) And now it's on sale! Go get it and have some good old school RTS!"
I played this game when it was first released back in 1999 and loved it and im still playing today and its only got better thanks to steam and the Steam community
"Game is very fun, however, I seem to have a problem with lag on my computer with it. No other game I have has lag, and it obviously isn't my computer. I thought maybe my ISP isn't good enough, however, this is the only game I have problems with. The game just seems to be choppy, Not sure what to do. When I first got this game it was absolutely fine. Now it does it even when I play campaign. Not sure what to do to make it better. 9/10 Would be 10/10 but the choppiness really messes with my fun."
I've been playing this game for years before steam came out with it again. Whenever i play solo againt AI they dont build walls. That makes it to easy to attack them and not as much fun anymore.
"Incredible game, after many year it's still one of the best RTS. Versatile and suitable for anyone, recommended."
"It simply lags, not because of my computer, but because of the broken mechanics, don't believe me? Google it. The numbers of people having issues with this game is ridiculous. I don't recommend buying this, it's been a long time and nobody fixed anything. I couldn't play this game at all. I love the original AoE 2."
Finally! I can play this superb Game again (a damn great blast from the past!:-) - and it's in eye-pleasing HD!   If you have played the 'normal' version - be joyful: the devs didn't tamper with the balance!   The only thing that I miss is the 'jump to event'-button  (It was quite helpful when you've ordered your monks ot pick up the relics - I clicked the button when I heard the notification sound and I made the monk carry that thing back to the monastery.   Still - it's an awesome classic - 10/10
It is good to be king.  10/10
AI will beat your ♥♥♥ to a pulp/10
Perfect. Waiting for the classic ONE and RISE OF ROME on Steam. Why not now?
"If there were ever a way to make the murder of hundreds of innocent villagers child-friendly and guilt free, it's this game. It's a true wonder from my childhood that, because I've researched atheism in the past, has another two-hundred and eighty four years left before it wins me the game. Thankfully, my understanding of the possibility that god isn't real has also allowed me to hire spies for a far cheaper price. All that's left is to figure out why. In the meantime though, I can safely say that Age of Empires is a well-balanced and realistic game where seige rams move faster than racecars when full of armoured soldiers, and you can set fire to buildings with swords and javelins. Perhaps even better, the longbowmen can hit a castle and the castle do a thing about it, because only the British know how to get a bow, and make another one using a bigger stick. Thankfully there are counters to these longbowmen. You know those guys who come to your door and want to talk about Jesus? They annoy the enemies so much in this game that the enemies will actually join your side to shut them up. Just hire on of them to ask that pesky longbowmen 'Wolololo' (that roughly translates to 'Sir, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour Jesus Christ?') and he'll be shooting YOUR enemies castle faster than you can say 'I serve the anti-christ'. Just make sure that your guy has other guys spurring him on with encouraging chants, because those chants can heal arrow wounds. Just like they thought magic words and chants could heal fatal wounds in ancient times, they actually can in this game. The joy doesn't end there though; there's everything from villagers able to kill armed calvary to seige ongars that will happily crush the people who should be operating them. Speaking of which, no one has to man the seige weapons. How great is medieval AI!? 10/10 would wolololo enemy troops again."
i remember playing this game for HOURS when i had the disks but then i lost it and was SO HAPPY to see it come to steam its so much fun
One of the first RTS games I ever played and I still can't get enough of it!
"This game is so good, spent countless hours playing it on the original disk (which it seems i misplaced). Definitely recommend, it epitomizes what a good strategy game should encompass...strategic thinking, bold decisions, lots of killing, and when all else fails, futeristic cars that mow down enemy infantry in seconds."
"Fun game overall, while it has bugs, if you have nestelgia for AOE2, you will enjoy HD"
"There's not much that makes it HD....the graphics are still as 16-bit and pixilated as ever before. Interface does expand, and I'm playing at 1600X1200 (my current monitor resolution), and it shows a great part of the screen.  Don't expect this to be any prettier than the gold old-fashioned AOE2 for Windows 98...because it's not. But, it is the most updated version (including all the upgrades you can purchase within each building). A great, classic game, as always!"
"Great game everything i remembered as a kid, i got it for 19.99 about a month ago i dont regret it one bit even if they just dropped it to 4.99 &gt;.&lt; GF STEAM GF."
"Yes, I love it"
"I've spent too many hours playing this game in the past and now that is back in HD I recomend this game fully. A classic stratagy game that will test your wits, cunning and provide hours of fun. A must have!"
Brings back so many memories. Great game.
"Best real-time strategy game ever in my opinion. Probably gonna get hate for this, but f*ck Starcraft. This is where it's at."
"I loved this game as a kid but it has aged a bit. Saying this is an HD edition is stretching it, I cant really tell a difference between teh regular and HD versions. Its nice to have a nastolgia rush but other then that you might as well pick up AOE 3"
"The hands-down best RTS of all time, now in with best presentation that it has yet had."
.
Makes me wanna do hood rat stuff with my friends
Great to play this classic once again! A great RTS  Looks great once you download some new Textures :)
an old classic brought back from the dead and updated graphics HOLY BAT S**T.
Fantastic game. Many an evening has been spent in front of my computer with a pizza and this game. Extremely fun to play with friends as well.
Good classic game
"Prefer this version of the game to the newer ones, I like being able to see the bigger screen and the large range of settings to create your own game detail/map. I like that you can play a whole game in a pretty short time if thats what you want or if you want to drag it out over days you can just by changing a few simple settings. I like that you can win the game in a variety of ways - not always by fighting other AI players, i.e. you can win by collecting all the relics or building a wonder. In other words you don't always have to take a violence route, which is my personal preference!"
"Well it's what you love and hate about age of empires II. It's you know, the game Age of Empires II. Which is nice, and like less nice in certain aspects, but mostly nice.  8/10 would buy again."
"Got it on sale, much worth 100/10."
Brilliant!
True to the original - plays well!
"This game is the best. Most of my time on it is from LAN matches on the regular AOE II, but this port is still excellent. There seems to be some lag issues and connectivity issues, and it doesn't seem to be HD necessarily, but it is still a great game."
This is an all time classic strategy game that comes from the era that placed the biggest focus on gameplay. The fact that it still has a strong following 16 years on speaks volumes.   Pros: Great gameplay mechanics Excellent PvP gamplay Easy to learn but difficult to master  Cons: Dated graphics (but seriously who cares?!)
  I totally review this game for the badges.   Plz ignore me &lt;3
Great game!
Great game!
Best RTS. Played it since i was 14
"best with multiplayer, one of my favortites to play"
Love this game and the updates the have completed. Reminds me of the good times when I was a kid!
What else can be said about the game that walk with us during our childhood? Stop reading this rewiews and buy the game.
"An amazing historical educational tool! Teaches people about the importance of: -Stabbing your house will cause a fire. -Waving a wand at people will cause them to be under your command -The Chinese invented gunpowder, block printing, and crop rotation, but aren't able to get them. -Being able to produce hundreds of paladins despite only in real life being 12 paladins. -Villagers like using knives in combat despite being able to wield flaming arrows. -A battering ram hitting the air will cause your crops to wilt. -The fact that your civilization knows about fletching, bodkin arrows, and bracers affect how far a cannonball travels, despite those technologies purposes are to make arrows travel further. -People in Medieval times apparently had bullet spewing cars -A fat king travels faster than a horseman    Want a serious review? Fine.  Age of Empires II HD is an excellent bargain during Steam Sales, with all DLC bought during the sale along with the base game costing less than the base game pre Steam Sale. The game is just as I remembered it to be years ago, but with prettier water and better AI, it will burn away hours of your life away... Don't have a good internet connection to play multiplayer? Don't want to get pwned during multiplayer matches but want a little more spice in your single player game? Then campaign is for you, with many different stories to follow. Overall, 11/10, would get wololo'd again."
Very good edition :D Brings back all the memories of playing this as a child and the inclusion of online multiplayer matchmaking is something that I always wanted :D
It brings back so many memories. I love it. Five stars! *****
I'd bust a cap in yo ♥♥♥ and play this game right after. That's how good this ♥♥♥♥ is.  Beware lag issues however.
"This is a great game! Much better than the CD version, less laggy and no freezing/connection issues."
It's the awesome classic real-time strategic game. I recommend it strongly!
"Dope as soap on a rope, yo."
Love the remake! Just like playing the old version but better!
"Age of Empires 2 is one of the best RTS i have ever played, i love this game!"
You all know what it is! nice bit nostalgia
This game is bloody the best!
"Defintely cool to see an upgrade to an old classic. By today's standards it's pretty dated, but it's easy to see how the gameplay influenced the strategy genre."
"Great game, wish they'd HD Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds."
No regrets at all best thing i ever spent my money on
"It's quite delcious, I enjoy it a lot except for the high amount of diarrhea lol"
"While I'll grant that I expected a little more than a simple addition of widescreen resolutions, the simple fact is that Age of Empires II still stands up remarkably well today as an RTS, whether you're just a casual player or a more season veteran. Despite its rapidly approaching 14th birthday, it's still a ton of fun to play today."
"Age of Empires 2... what more can I say :DD  Best strategy for me &lt;3  A lot of people complain that the graphics are not improved.. well HD can mean that it supports bigger resolutions + multiple screens... So some people say is it worth the money? Well, it has Steam Workshop, you can download texture changes / taunts / maps / other mods + you get a multiplayer with many people all the time online. It's up to you whether you pay for those things ;-)  P.S. in multipalyer, the out of sync happens because of people with unsupported mods (some mods require all people to have them installed)."
The new update makes old to new even newer. Bravo!
"While I dont really understand how they can call this HD with the same old graphics, this is still the same awesome game we all grew up on, concquering your friends and making a name for yourself as the fairest/evilest, ally/enemy ruler in the land! Steam bringing this out relaunches the multiplayer ability online, which is the very best way to play it! Everyone should have at least one crack at this game. Its very much so worth it!!!"
"After years of struggle with hamachi and other virtual lan services it's finally easy to play with friends and other people online, with the plus of added content, compatibility with high resolutions and steam workshop. Was definitely worth the bucks even if you play only once in a while, since there's no game that can take the place of aoe2."
"Classic, with some new campaigns!"
If you are a hard core Age of Empires fan YOU MUST GET THIS GAME!!!
"I have played Age of Empires 2 since before the original expansions, The Conquerers.   The new looks made availble through the STeam workshop have defeintely made this a required update for me, and worth far more than the price to being back an old favorite that had fallen to the wayside.   Thanks Steam Dae"
"Good update to a classic, which makes it actuallt playable on Win 7 without the weird texture color glitch on everything."
awesome game. is anybody willing to trade me this game so i can give it to some of my friends you will get the ship and nuclear dawn in return
"Get it on sale!, the multiplayer actually works this time round. Still a bit pricy for a refurbished game."
"Amazing game. The ammount of options in the game is astonishing, and the gameplay is phenomenal. Up there in the top RTS's of all time. My favorite RTS. 5/5"
"Classic. I still remember when this game first came out and I would play it for days (literally) without showering or sleeping much. The nostalgic feeling comes rushing back with the HD version. Sure, the HD doesn't help too much... but, we aren't playing a game that came out 1999 for the graphics are we? The gameplay and mechanics are, in my opinion, perfect in AoE2. The HD version is simply a slight improvement. Plus, the steam workshop is a valuable addition.   A must buy for any RTS fan."
"IT'S AGE OF F*CKING EMPIRES!!! Whadya need to know more? Go grab it. One the best rts games ever created.., now in HD!"
still the best aoe game.
"Of course this is the timeless classic with a few new 'twists', gotta have it. Prepare for a super nostalgic trip back in time. I am only dissapointed with a few noticable problems, like the interface size. They seem to have made it unbearably tiny, with no way to zoom in. Also a few bugs in the map creator. All in all, this game is a slightly better looking copy of the original classic"
An incredible RTS game that never gets old is now officially in HD.
"Lars, get this game. I recommend it!"
"This game came out when I was in 6 or 7th grade. I am now a high school teacher, and I still play it. That should tell you how awesome this game is."
it's an amazing Game i ever played
"My all time favorite game, reminds me of my childhood playing with friends after school, and guess what? It still holds up. Get the 4 pack and give some copies to your friends and it will feel like you;ve never stopped playing it. A Masterpiece. The Forgotten Empires expansion really adds depth and balances the game to a sweet spot.  DISCLAIMER: Even though the gameplay is still the same, there are still a few issues and bugs that the development team is thankfully squashing. Even though the game still has a few issues, rest assured that it's being worked on."
It's AoE2 of old...but with better graphics. Get this game if you like building a city and an army to defend it or global conquest. A great time waster without feeling like a time wasting game. 9/10
"One of my childhood classics!!  If only i could show you the hundreds of hours i played as a child, although then i knew it with the kings and conquerors expansions.  No other game of this style could beat this one! now even the third came close!"
"Quality, online play with mates without any hassle is fantastic."
"A RTS classic, with exciting medieval warfare and a blend of civilizations, this will keep you entertained with the new Steam port; with Steam workshop and a functional multiplayer!"
"tons of fun to have , great classic game"
"old classic redone.....same old gameplay but with higher res, definitely recommended to fans of the original as well as fans of rts"
"A legendary all time classic game from the late 90s. If you like real time strategy games and you have not ever played this one, then... sorry but... you do not have a clue about what a real time strategy game means. If you had spend hours with 'Age of empires 2' then this game is your time machine plus some new interesting campaigns waiting for you. It is not a remake/newer version of the classic game and don't expect spectacular graphics, cinematic effects or any other major change. It remains genuine as it was in the late 90s with only a few minor changes for the graphics compatibility and that's all. (If you are one of those guys, that we are still waiting for a newer version of AOE2 with fascinating graphics, sound and the old highly entertaining gameplay, HD edition... definitely.. is not the one we were expecting to come!)."
this game is good kept original but just better
One of the most addicting games i'v ever played
"Not sure why the metascore for this game is so low. I was skeptical at first paying for this game, but being able to play it online again is worth the $10."
This game is awesome. You get to pwn Haochen in his little Chinese balls.
Great remake of one of the best turn based strategie game of all time. Good value.
"Great game, awesome update from the classic version. Pretty much a must play if you have a pc."
"the memories , relived"
This game is a classic. The new achievements and the more accessible multiplayer make my 5$ investment a good deal!
"Easily the best Age of Empires and the re-release made me play it with my mates again and enjoy hours of late night massive army mayhem. It is a great strategy game, fun for all ages - the only real thing that I can ping it on is the multiplayer connection. We find that it can be a bit unstable and sometimes players can’t connect to one another and sometimes they can - but that’s networking for you.  Overall the game has had its textures improved somewhat, though if you miss the old ones the steam workshop is the place to go, the carnage is the same and it might remind the gamers of the previous decade just how good some of the older titles were before we messed with the winning formula.  Would recommend this game to any one, both those who have never played it, or people like me who remember this game from years ago. "
"A faithful remake of an old favourite, I snapped up AoE2:HD straight away!  I have long considered AoE2 the best of the series and now any problems I had with the now-aged AoE2 have been put to rest with the HD reboot.  Now you can see far more on the screen than before (town center now not the only thing on the screen!) and not only that, if you have multiple monitors you can extend your vision even further (not stretched!). With 3x2 monitors you can see pretty much an entire small map at once.  Overall the game is very well balanced and promotes multiple approaches to play. The single player campaign is as fun as ever and a great introduction to the mechanics of the game.  The multiplayer/skirmishes add another level of strategy with team bonuses.  The new expansion adds some new mechanics, units and maps which again feels very balanced and trying the new civilizations definitately keeps the game fresh. Personally I love the Inca special unit, a spearman with incredible range but with a minimum range also.  Definately a game to pick up for long-time RTS fans and newcomers to the genre."
"Old school, but still fun :)"
"AOE 2 is back in the ring with the all new HD Edition. Same Great Game Way better graphics. Not thrilled about the lack of graphic options, but thats Microsoft for you."
"Fun game to play with friends, pretty nostalgiac too."
"I grew up on the Age of Empires franchise. My brother and I would skirmish against each other and I would always lose to his rush of cavalry. Even so, I love this game. I have always and will always continue to play it. The game is great if you truly love RTS. It's one of the games that set the standards for all other RTS games on the market. Just don't be fooled by the 'HD' tag. In this case, the 'HD' in (Age of Empires II HD) merely means that it's optimized for the modern generation of computers rather than giving the game modern textures. The only difference I have noticed is a slightly different water texture that is a little more updated for the times. But don't let that deter you! This game is one in a million. It's a MUST-HAVE in your collection."
"Retro is good. If you liked it before, you'll still do. One of those legends!   Such shame the online game has still some major issues I ran into: constant lag made it simply unplayable (tried different hosts). I have to point out not everyone has these issues."
Great revival of a great classic.
Probably the best game I have ever played. But I am biased because I have played this game since I was 7.
They even made a new expansion say what?!
Release of long time classic! Must have for everyone that played orginal AOE2. Now with great multiplayer support to play with your friends. 8.5/10
"One of the best games ever remastered with excellent online play, I have a lot of modern games to play, still unbeaten but the game I wasted most of my childhood on keep pulling me back in. Buy it."
Nostalgic... Thats it
"Age of Empires II (or simply Age of Kings to some) is hands down one of the best RTS games of all time. It improved over its predecessor in terms of graphics, sound, control and single player campaigns, all modeled after historical figures. While one can argue about improvements of AoE3 or the creativity of Age of Mythology, the fact remains that Age of Kings perfectly captures an era of strategy gaming set in a medieval world combining town and army building, gathering and conquering that still holds up today (save for some minor quirks regarding old manners of gameplay). Very little of this game is 'HD' as most gamers think of it save for increased monitor resolutions and aspect ratios, but the new water effects are quite fantastic. This release also comes with all the content from the original game and The Conquerors expansion which is a plus. One of the main draws of this release is Steamworks and Workshop implementation which makes it easy to find mods and matches. If you have fond memories of this game, I'd say get it to relive the golden age of Windows gaming. If you've never played this game before, try it. You might learn something."
"If you liked the original, this one is great!"
"great game, a real classic !!!"
"Age of Empires 2 HD is a remake of the original Age of Empires 2 which was popular back in the day but no longer able to run on modern machines as resolution sizes have increased and old multiplayer protocols no longer exist.  I'd recommend this for a few reasons: Nostaligia / great game, Steam Workshop / custom content, Multiplayer match-making via Steam so you can join your friends with ease."
"Every bit as good as when I first played it. If you missed it the first time around, this is a must buy."
"Excellently crafted game, challenging AI at times yet still fun also amazing with friends"
AoE 2. What more can you say?
Just as good as the orginal with a graphics upgrade. Still one of the best RTS on the market.
this game is amazing 
If I have to put this game into 1 sentence  Medieval Castle Destruction Simulation for Strategy Extremists.  if put into one word  AWESOME!!!!
Classic.
"The original was my first ever pc game, and I spent countless hours playing it over years. HD release keeps the best, and adds much more. If you like great rts games, it's a must play."
dis game is hella rad
Everyone needs to replay this classic :)
"This game is SUCH a classic among PC gamers that I feel like there's almost nothing to say here except 'It's AoE 2. You should own it.' Without going into the games many virtues or talking about the many hours myself (many of them prior to this, the Steam HD re-release) and others have poured into this game, I will say that the main benefit of this HD version is not the graphics. No, despite running at HD resolutions (which is definitely super nice), the graphics and animations are basically the same as they ever have been. The real benefit, then, to this updated re-release, is that it has fully integrated Steam support for Multiplayer. This makes it super easy to jump into a game with friends and have an amazing time."
A delightful HD version of an old classic RTS that needs no introduction!
Age of Empires is a classic that never ages. Just the best game ever.
This game is made of nostalgia for me. Playing this revamped version brings back some very fond childhood memories and the game really still holds up (unlike the first) after all this time.
"Remarkable how many people still play this over a decade after release. Though there are many multiplayer-RTS games on the market, this one was one of those who set the standard. Though very basic it's good for a few hours of nostalgia, and because of the internet era the first time some of us will be able to experience the multiplayer mode."
Amazing game ! So much fun I've convinced all my close friends to get a copy. Even went out of my way and bought it for a few! They all love it as well. There are a fwe muiltiplayer issues that need to be addressed but anything that's not 4v4 runs great!
"great nostalgic game, too bad the AI of the troops is very poor..."
This game has always had a good soundtrack.
Same as many years ago but still doesnt worth it for such crazy price. buy it only with discount or if u dont care about price just buy it :) gameplay experience is as amazing as it was 10 years ago.
"This takes me back to the days, absolutely love this game!! was one of my favourite games when i was younger and this new HD lick of paint is fantastic pretty much haven't stopped playing it since I bought it, thouroughly recommend it to anyone interested in RTS games"
"4 Hour games with people rushing your ♥♥♥♥ straight away while you villagers play with their berries, always rely on your late game. Fun."
An amazing game every one should get it!!!!
"This sweet sweet game is better than most at bringing back those memories...Building an empire, from villagers to monuments and the sheep slaying in between. It echoes the greatness of the original with an extra couple of pixels. Get amongst this delightful look into the past."
this game brought me into the rts gene when i was little kid! im so happy to see it restored for online play :)
"Still one of my favorite games after all these years and the HD relaunch is fantastic. Everything looks so much better, the music is improved, and the new additions are great. Definitely reccomended for anyone who is a fan of these types of games."
"This is the first game I ever owned back in the day. Me and my friends from school days are now playing for a bit of nostalgia, and are getting more out of it now than we did then! A classis RTS, looks a bit dated, but the music still stands up. Gameplay, great. Online, great. Don't miss out on the chance to own one of the best strategy games ever made."
"Good game but multiplayer can disconnect because of an 'out of sync' error. However upon close inspection it's really quite a rare error, for me anyway.  I'm awful at the game but it is bloody brilliant."
An absolutely must play classic.
"Thanks for bringing back this classic. And with addon no less. It doesn't aged that much, drawn 2D graphic still looks good. If you somehow managed to missed it when it was in full bloom, grab it now. Don't let pixels discourage you, there is a lot of soul there, I don't play multiplayer at all, but heard it was pretty balanced. Campaigns are interesting and fun, way better than in first one. Beat them all. Mongols are by far the best. Hope the addon will live up to expectations as well."
"This is my childhood returned, buy this now...honestly, there's a thing at the top that says 'Buy' click it."
Great !!!
"A extraordinary strategy game for the one who want to build up a medieval empire and fight enormous battles. Multiplayer is where the real conquest begins. The game can be very intensive at some times and very rewarding when the strategies work. Nothing is more exciting than starting a grand siege, and watch as the trebutchets pumble the enemy walls to dust and how your soldiers make short work of all that stands in your way.  10/10"
"Classic PC game. Haven't had much of a chance to play it on Steam, but this was one of the best strategy games back in the day."
Brilliant game with hours of entertainment
An RTS classic that everyone should play before they die.
A awesome classic that never gets old. Still one of my favorite RTS.
"Very fun RTS, especially with friends,  I was never very good with RTS games, but this one ha sa great tutorial and learning the ropes doesn't take too long. The gameplay is solid, and games can last for hours of nonstop changing strategy. The AI are not the smartest, but are pretty good when it comes to reacting to your moves.  If you have friends who play this game, since you won't find many multiplayer games, this is a definite buy. For a game made in 2003 it still holds up pretty well!"
Great graphic update to one of the greatest strategy games of all time
"Whether you are a fan of the original or new to the game, Age of Empires II HD does an exellent job at recreating one of the greatest games of all time."
AoE2 with better graphix. What's not to love?
It gives me the tickles in my dickles.  Me gusta.
i love this game good for lan partys
I had not played this game in about 10 years and I recently bought this on the steam sale. Classic game I am still having a blast playing it now. One of the most important strategy games ever made. Gameplay is exactly the same so if you enjoyed this game 10 years ago you still enjoy it in all it's glory today. It has everything the oringial had including multiplayer with the expansion thrown in. The visuals look much better and as far I could tell it has been well opitimized. Exactly what a HD re-release should be.
"Delivers what you remember (a lot), and is seriously fun to play multiplayer."
"This game, while being over 13 years old (or something like that), is still totes awesome!"
Nice game !
Im so happy they renewed this game and the GF are so much better. :)
I enjoy this game.
This game is straight Dopamine homie.
Brought back so many memories..really like the huge map and 500 population increase..that was a really needed upgrade from 200
"Classic game in HD, plus now with added content, great game and now easy to play again with friends, would recommend for epic battles with friends, be warned, good games can last for hours.  Monopoly has got nothing on this game in time consuming XD"
"This is one of the games I played as a child. When I figured out that they had it on steam, I just had to have it! I bought a four pack and play the game alot with my friends. This game has alot of gameplay in it. I'm not to fond of playing other people online, but the custom scenario builder in this game provides fun for me and my friends, a definate 10/10 everyone should buy a copy!"
"This is my favorite game. Highly recommend. The sounds, the gameplay, the 90's style rts. I love it."
Age of Empires II HD is a wonderful game that stands the test of time. If you already have the original and could care less about multiplayer/steam workshop you have better things to spend money on but otherwise I reccomend this game highly and feel you would get much enjoyment from it!
AoE2 brings back so many memories :D
"I remember purchasing this game 7 years ago. Before that time, I didn't have a good enough PC and didn't purchase the game at all, but when I did buy it eventually, I was amazed back then with how much Age of Empires had changed from its first generation and the expansion pack Rise of Rome. Of course, now I have a pretty good PC that was unfortunately too good for this game to play nicely on (the colours were messed up, the animation was slow and the soundtrack was missing), but thanks to Ensemble Studios, this game is in HD with better animations on troop movement, the water looks very well done, the colours didn't bugger up and I got to hear the original soundtrack this game had (although I downloaded the Game of Thrones Soundtrack from the workshop that replaced them all!). Not only was that the reason I decided to get this game at the Christmas Steam sale, this game also included the DLC (I would say expansion pack but lets be honest, that is now old school talk!) 'The Forgotten' which features 4 new campaigns, 5 new civilizations and new maps and modes. I was excited after seeing this released and had to buy it when it came on sale too. I would recommend this to anyone new to real time strategy games."
I just love getting my ♥♥♥♥ thrashed by the computer.
"I love this game, glad to be able to play it again."
Same old sh*t with new options. Better than drugs.
"Very fun game, it is very similar to the original, but it is still a great classic for RTS fans!"
"A classic if I've ever played one. I remember this being my very first RTS game, I was beyond addicted and revissiting the game after all these years has opened gates of nostalgia.   The Graphics aren't the greatest obviously, but it was released back in 1999, so it's understandable. I personally cannot see the difference between the HD and remake, but other people may think otherwise.   The Gameplay is great! It took time to remember all the controls and functions, but after 10 minutes of tutorial time my memory was restored. The feel of building up a base, following with an army of men-at-arms, and storming an enemy is fantastic. And let's not forget the feeling after you've completed the requirements to advance to the next age, unlocking so many upgrades, and finally getting rid of that bloody scout horseman!   User Interface is simple and, in my own opinion, one of the best I've seen in the Real Time Strategy genre. Everything is obvious, and takes little amount of your time. Although I feel the screen is a little crowded in some of the more intense moments of the game.   Finally the Storyline is like most RTS games, build an army to rid the opposition and conquer the land. Their are many scenarios to choose from, the Tutorial involving the Scottish fighting back the English and stepping into the shoes of Sir William Wallace at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297.   Overall, It's a brilliant game, and if you're able to cope with outdated graphics, I'd fully recommend this game. Cannot wait to play the third one when I purchase my Gaming PC! 9/10"
Feeling nostalgic for classic RTS games? - This one is it! The HD version is very nice.
"classic game, hours of goodness"
"Absolutely wonderful! I actually prefer AoE2 to AoE3, due to the intense variability offered in AoE2 games; you have dozens of civilizations to choose from, many maps that vary each playthrough, and the option to select 'random' for most anything and really try out the game in full. Totally recommend it."
pretty good. get it when its on sale. notihing to special.
great game wif old memory!!!
A classic brought into the new age with HD graphics that make it look fantastic!   Having spent months playing this as a kid it was nice to see it pop up on Steam with improved graphics. It brought back great memories of days long since gone!
"This is the game of my childhood. 8/10 amazing game, godfather of rts"
"The game to play during my college years. Over a decade later, the replayability is excellent"
Great. And Very Memorialable Game!
"This game is a staple of the RTS genre. Whether you are new to style or a seasoned veteran, AOE II has something to offer. The gameplay learning curve is relatively small. They have recently remapped the Hotkeys to be more intuitive. Developers are constantly working to balance and improve the game. As a long time fan of the original, the added bonuses of Steam multiplayer hosting and new expansions are wonderful. This game is worth every penny (and hour) you spend on it!"
Great Game
itll be years before you can face me soraka
Cannot get enough even after 10+ years! Love it as much as i used to when I was a kid.
"Fantastic game, even better with HD graphics!"
"This is RTS at its finest with beautiful new stunning graphics, it takes nostalga and shoves it into your face. If you want to enjoy your childhod (or younger adult) and relive it in new HD and enjoy playing new maps and with full support from steam than buy this game. 10/10 for renewing a glorious game series."
Worth every penny
One of the best strategy games I've ever played.
Good RTS from back in the day. *rock in chair*
Great game. Cant wait to play it more.
It's Age of Empires. Need I say more?
One of the best strategy games there are.
Never trust the Chinese.
one of the best strategy games i ever played ANd i have played it for 10 years on and off and got over a 1000Hours on it possibly more but thats off steam so far allmost a 100Hours and still rising i love the game and i do recomend it if you are a true strategy lover this game is unkillable in my oppinion
This game is one of the greatest strategy games in existence. Easy to learn and fun to play for all ages.
"This game was all my childhood, and it's back. Great game, really fun, brought me hours of pleasure and my childhood back. Buy it now, seriously, you won't regret it. ALL HAIL KING OF THE LOSERS"
This game creates a feeling as if you were playing monopoly with your friends. It begins with some hate and anger and as the first hour of the game passes nobody is friends anymore. the high impact sexual violence that follows the seccond hour can only be described as 100 horses charging at a wall made of stone and it being set on fire. then the third hour passes and any one who is still in the game is at the brink of suicide but also filled with a jello like substace called determination. fourth hour passes and nobody belives the game is still going. turns out the only victroy option was relics and one of the relics was missing. 11/10 worth killing a friendship over.
Can't stop playing
"Age of Empires II was always a fantastic game. My family and I have played since it first released, and still whip it out today on occasion. It's never gotten old. By all means, I am glad someone worked to bring this game forward to modern systems, allowing it to be enjoyed for many years more.  However, there are a few issues we had with this new version. Several changes are a minor issue. The new AI is ridiculous, acting more like a highly coordinated swarm. Buildings and units are scattered, all moving independently, and good heavens if one spots your army all units converge on your location immediately. This style of AI makes it extremely difficult when you they AI makes ranged units, or even bloody monks. With regard to their cities, the new AI fixes some building placement flaws (not as many castles built in back), but many times I now see the AI scattering mines randomly outside their city, and on multiple occasions had to smash my way through a 4-deep wall of bombard towers. It's cute, and actually kind of fun... sometimes. The old AI, while admittedly flawed in ways, at least acted human in ways, moving troops in groups. While I could once defeat the old AI in 1v1 on Hard difficulty no problem, I now struggle with Standard, often dying very early in the game, and I'm no RTS noob. This all said, there is an option to choose between the new AI or the old - last I played, at least. Both have their flaws and perks, so really it's a matter of preference.  Also, I don't really care that it's HD. I just want to play the game, and got along just fine without HD for over a decade. This wouldn't be a problem for me if there were an option to adjust the resolution and some graphics settings. This HD edition makes modern systems very laggy that, while low-power by todays standards, could demolish any game put out when AoEII was introduced. Kind of ridiculous, I think. Especially when not much has actually improved visually, in my opinion.  But really, who cares. This is a classic. I'm simply overjoyed that somebody brought it back, and understand that renewing old games with old engines isn't easy. The game runs, I no longer have to wait ages (har har) and spend hours troubleshooting server connections to play a single multiplayer game with my brother in the other room. Steam makes this all incredibly easy and relatively smooth. The developers even added a version of the modern A-move (though here it's a tab-move, and not totally reliable).  RTS is easily my favorite genre of game, and I'm a huge fan of StarCraft II. But in a time where RTS games are few and far between, and often require fast reaction times that make it difficult for casual players, it's great to have a familiar LAN-party favorite back. Cheers to the developers that made this possible, and here's to many years more of great RTS."
Its a classic. Hands down a experience everyone should have. There is absolute nothing bad I have to say about this game. It is a bit expensive for its age but you could always grab it on sale.
"Age of Empires is a classic among PC games, and while still played widely today it was starting to show its age - e.g. low framerate cap, poor networking support, no high resolution support. The HD edition updates the game to meet modern standards making it better than ever before. Recommended both for newcomers and those who played the original when it first came out."
Wild.
"Classic game, made even better"
LOVE IT!
cant go wrong with a classic like this. tyhey also have finally worked out most of the kinks 
This game is amazingly addictive. I start playing and notice that my whole day is gone. 10/10 must play.
"Greatest strategy game ever made, and it shall remain so most likely. Although civilizations are much too similar to each other, they have enough differences to be distinguished competitively. Great map editor allows for many different scenarios too."
"Great classic game, spent many hours in the past competing online ! Great buy....."
"Fantastic game, a real blast from the past for me!!"
it is a very fun game it is better than number 3 option wise but 3 has better graphics.
Love this game.
"Great game, fun to play though can get a bit tedious and boring in the longer games 7.5/10"
Best game of all time
Wololo
"I grew up with this, this game is so freaking awesome! There are some problems with latency and such, but I can easily look over that because this game is everything I remember! :I"
Is Don.  Is good.
"+ The same experiance of playing AoE2 12 years ago but with a few small improvements on multiplayer interface. + Long drawn out macro games are really fun.   - Not worth more than £5. - Nothing noticable has been improved on other than the game now works with widescreen. This isn't an acomplishment as mods existed for free that allowed this to happen years before the release. - The multiplayer matchmaking is really basic and random. You can look at your opponents rating and exit the game safely without penalty before the game starts. - Picking a naval civilization on a random map and drawing 'black forest' and having none of your civs bonuses have any impact is a balance issue. Some maps have a good blend of water/land but some just make certain civs weak.  OVERALL: People were generally good on release, rarely could I just cheese into castle age and build a castle on someones front door whilst they were still in the dark age (A great way to dumpster trash). If it's cheap and you played back in the day then i'd reccomend you try it. If you've never played it you didn't own a computer in 1999 and probally had a crap childhood."
""
A great remake of a classic game!
amazing game and much better graphics than the original
This is a fantastic remake of the classic AOE 2 in HD. Totally worth the fun!
"I recommened it for the game, not for the HD update, which is garbage. Buy this game to relive the awesome times had on the original but don't expect it to be a good improvement or even a worthy improvement."
i bought it yester day for 19 dollars -.-´........... 
"The sounds of childhood, the gameplay of absolute perfection, the charm of an undisputed King - this game won't let you go for hours and hours! A must-have for all who love old-school RTS and/or Medieval times."
This classic RTS strategy has aged well.  *pun intended.
"Same as the original but can be run at 1920 x 1080, they've also added steam achievements but the most useful part is being able to invite and join games using steam."
"Amazing, just like the old days of playing this as a child!"
"A very great classic. Easy to pick up and play by yourself, with friends, or with anyone else on the world really! I highly recommend this for anyone who loves a good old RTS."
I thought this would bring back memories from when I was younger and it certainly did! By today's standards it is very dated in terms of the controls but the graphics are still brilliant for what they are.   If you have played this before and want to relive it then I would recommend this however if you have come on the RTS scene a bit more recently I would stear away from this one and get something released a bit more recently.
One of the greatest games of all time  GET IT
Still the best aoe of the series although the hd series doesn't change much in the graphics. The online makes it worth to buy
"Well, what can I say. I mean, it's freaking AoE II. Honestly i'm just doing this for the badge."
This game was a big part of my childhood around middle school. This classic RTS that Microsoft Studios developed pioneered the RTS genre to what it is today. If you remember playing this game (or have never played it) then get this HD re-make with Steam matchmaking support! Oh and go Britons!!!
"Classic game, now in HD...   Still amazing, and a little unbalanced, but always fun"
This game is alittle old but it one of the best RTS around i had good menories playing it when i was little 
Amazing game woth the money on sale or not.
"One of the greatest RTS in HD, thats all you need to know. Is it worth it at $20, no, if you can find on sale then yes."
"I love AOE2 but HD are so damn laggy, cant even play the game for the FPS Drop..... plz help me if you know how to fix it plz."
"It was great then, it still is now!"
Totally grew up with this game and its return has brought back some crazy fun memories of playing with friends in LANs. The online is a little slow and can crash sometimes but its great with friends!
"A blast from the past! The good old Age of Empires we know and love, but with an added abilities such as access to DLC and Steam workshop items! The campaign is challenging, yet fun, with hours packed into completing it. The multiplayer capabilities are wonderful, as you can easily play with your friends as you aim to conquer even the hardest of foes. A wonderful buy, I would reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a great strategy game."
"Very cool, brings back so many memories playing this years ago!"
Such a nice game with great mechanics involved. I am happy to replay this game with much better graphics and thanks to the team of developpers with an enthusiastic scope.
"While the first in the series still holds a special place in my heart, this title brings back a lot of nostalgic memories. Fans of RTS or old school PC games have everything they want right here.  Do not however be fooled by the release, the 'HD' is ♥♥♥♥ poor and the singleplayer AI is about as bad as bad gets. This is no better but no worse than the original AoE II  (Also, I'm always up for games of this, no one wants to play me after I remembered that preists existed)"
"It's one of the best Real-Time Strategy games from a bygone era, where excellent gameplay mechanics melded seamlessly with a vibrant story. This is a relic from the era where RTS dominated the PC, and it's fun not only as a nostalgia trip, but also as a genuinely excellent game. Definitely recommend."
"game does not work, everyt ime I want to start playing I get a Script error. pls Fix it, I realy love this game and I want to play It. "
good old classic :)
"Age of Empires 2 is, without a doubt, my favorite game of all time. Its not just nostalgia talking, either. It may lack a few quality-of-life features that more modern RTS like Starcraft 2 have, and the meta has been relatively unchanged for almost the lifespan of the game (Although, the new expansion changed it up a lot, and fan made balance mods are quite popular, so look out for those if playing online) but it still stands as a masterpiece of the RTS genre in both mechanics and single player creative value. It still has a pretty big online playerbase for a 15 year old game, too.   Now, dont expect a huge new overhaul for the HD version. Its pretty much just a widescreen mode and a resolution bump, a new largest pop cap at 500 and a new larger map size, 'Ludakris', but there are tons of good texture and unit packs in the workshop if you want your game to look a bit more shiny than a 1999 release title :p  The issues, however, are noticeable. The game does not run very well for its age. Now, just speculation, I think that may have to do with the fact that it cant use more than one CPU core at a time. This problem only gets more noticeable when you add more players, higher population caps and larger maps, and more AI players. Playing a 4v4 on a Ludakris size map can tank your framerate VERY easily. Now, I dont really see that as a huge issue myself, but it may ♥♥♥♥ off other people, and understandably so.  Still, these problems aren’t too terribly huge. AoE 2 is still a fantastic game, and one that is worthy of any RTS fan's time."
"This is a great remake of an old classic - i have never found a game i like as much as this... maybe its a first love kinda thing...:) in the old version the computer sucked in Nomad because 3/4 never really got around to build a town center. this bug has been fixed and its great - however i once in a while experience that the computer nomatter which team its on just surrenders after starting worse than the other players. it hasnt killed anyone or lost anything it just gives up- that is kinda annoying, but still great to fall back in love with this ga,e"
"This is just about the Steam HD Edition! Altough I have owned the Original already, I bought the HD Version because I finally wanted to play the game on  multiple Monitors in a decent resolution . And this is finally possible. Previous mods made by fans never worked properly. I tested it on Win7 with AMD graphics and on Win8.1 with nVidia. No crashes, no bugs. Works flawlessly.  Now i can enjoy the game on 2 Monitors in HD or play it on the 55'screen without getting eyecancer. It is worth the money and wololo.   Most important hint: enter 30 in the chat to hear what you are so desperatly longing for. "
"Still getting rushed by millitia, hell even the computer sometimes does it."
I've been playing AoE II since I was around 6 or 7. I own copies of the entire series and this is a wonderful addition because it brings back a classic with the advantage of the steam network for multiplayer and enhanced graphics. I highly recommend this game to any AoE veteran or newcomer.
"Here's a blast to the past for you! Originally released in 1999 by Ensenble Studios, this game has the player micromanaging the essentials of a growing colonial civilization: collecting resources, building up towns, and fighting for hold of the land.There's a lot of singleplayer campaigns that re-enact historical events and battles, but personally most of the fun is in the Skirmishes. With 13 Renaissance-based civilizations to choose from, the player must quickly construct a town to fend off enemies who also vie for power and territory. As you advance your civilization's age, you are endowed with more powerful upgrades and troops which can turn the tides of battle. Build fast and conquer fast, but don't neglect your own defenses!  If you love strategy games that involve building and managing armies, this is the game for you!"
"Wow.... What can I honestly say. When I saw this game, I was completely overwhelmed with nostalgia and knew in a instant that I needed to download this game; and boy was I impressed. This is a fantastic HD remake of a classic."
I love this game; it reminds me of childhood. A classic RTS game.
Highly Recommend for anyone who likes RTS. One of the classics and still enjoyable no matter how bad the graphics are compare to other newer games.
Oh the memories. I feel like I'm 7 again. By itself the game hasn't changed a bit but that isn't necessarily bad. The multiplayer section could use come work but it's a good game overall. 8/10
"A handcore nostalgia kick. It is extremely enjoyable to sit back and re-experience a childhood favorite, recognize the music, remembering the different looks of buildings - this time only less squary than you might remember them. If you liked it when you were younger, you'll absolutely love to play it again now.  10/10 would play again. Wololo."
"Stellar remake, very well worth the money to revisit old memories and good times.  Had hoped for the addition of a few mechanical updates from later games, only for ease of gaming, but nothing to 'revolutionize' or change the flow of this original.  Still enjoyable and the Steam community compatibility makes it even better than the first time around"
"Age of Empires II is an awsome classic that throws you back into the good old days. My video gaming skills have improved since then however, and I find it easier than I used too to win :) I still recommend it if you enjoy a good (more basic) real time strategy game."
Good fun. Relatively easy to pick up if you have played Age of Mythology.
Simple and easy to understand. You and your friends will have fun with this one. That fun includes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pillaging eachothers villages. Not a big fan of the online because I like to take things slow but with people you know this game is hilarious.
It's a great remake of the classic. Easy to learn and get in to it. Difficult to master. Definitely buy.
Just as good as it was years ago.
Great game
The same game you know and loved ten years ago... With better picture quality.
This game is great.
Awesome multiplayer features
BUY IN 4 PACK FOR FRIENDS! this game is meant to be played in multiplayer if you dont have a friend to play with its ok thay do have a singleplayer but its less fun in my opinion
Its very good and in my opinion is better than 3 in the controls.
"One of my favourite ever games, with loads more cool stuff to it."
one of my favorite games of all time. its always been my go to game when i finish a game. or just want something to do for a while.
"Same classic game, now works with higher resolutions."
"The HD part isn't very visible. But it is still a fun game though. If you don't have it already, then buy this one."
Good Stuff
"Pretty rad update, loving the 500 pop cap!"
great game
The greatest strategy game of all time
great classic :)
This is a semi-historic Strategy game with multiple different ways to play the game both as a single player or in a multi-player mode. I think the HD graphics are an improvement. I like the upgrade/research options and the different difficulty options for the AI in this game.
"Well, its age of empires 2 with better graphics. A legend in gaming and still going strong :)"
You must buy this game!
Just as fun as it was when I first played it 10+ years ago.
Classic game that does not lose its greatness no matter how much time goes by. Always a blast to play.
Nice throwback game.
Got some friends? Got a few (or several) hours to spare for one game? Want a brilliant strategy game that still is good today?  BUY Age of Empires II Today!  Warning: Age of Empires will not be held responsible for ruining friendships if bullsh*t occurs.
"Grade A huge classic, I would recommend anyone who likes RTS's to play AOE. the second one was the best of all 3. from the base development to the fighting, it's still all round fun, years later :3"
"This game is amazing, brings back so many memories. Community is still very much alive and playing against other human players is crazy sometimes!!!"
a great game to have
10/10 would recommend to everyone.
One of the best games of my childhood and still one of the best RTSs to date IMHO.
It's really fun if you enjoy RTS.
Get this game it is a classic
"At Thanksgiving during cleanup I snuck into the pantry where the trash was so I could scare whoever opened the door next. I totally expected it to be my wife's aunt or mother-in-law. As the door slowly opened I let out a low but powerful growl starting off low volume into a yelling growl. Well, her 80 year old grandma almost fell down and then she grabbed her chest. Fortunately she was physically fine, meaning no hospital visit required. Unfortunately she needed a change of clothes. After much embarrassment for both, although I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥less, her and my wife's grandpa end up leaving. On the way out of the driveway she's waiving to everyone and I'm last in line. When she gets to me she doesn't wave but instead turns her hand into a gun and starts air shooting me as they back out of the driveway."
Who doesn't like Age of Empires!?!?! One of the best games ever made. Really takes you back to the good ol' 90s.
"Beautiful, what they have done to a classic game. Love the Graphical improvements, and classic gameplay.  Will spend many many hours on this game!"
my favourite game
"Enjoying it so far for the low, low price"
"I loved re-discovering this classic! All of the old stuff is there: Building a Wonder, setting up towers, fishing and farming and building... oh my! The graphics are of course antiquated by today's standards, but I was able to run this flawlessly on my new computer with a friend, and I was able to enjoy all of the silly audio chat sounds to boot!"
"This is the RTS game that made my childhood. It improved my English, learned me history, and made me a bunch of new friends, both online and offline.   With the HD version, I can even play it on never PC's without the dreadful color mismatches between win 98 and win 7."
Classic Game! As good as its ever been Childhood classic!
I have always loved this game and I always will. One of the best games ever made.
322
I love this game. Brings back memories.
"Brining back 'simple, effective and fun'"
Nothing changed but HD graphics r nice..
"Fantastic game, it's just like the old one, but HD."
"So much nostalgia. Just like I remembered, and that's a good thing. Next step: multiplayer via Steam, which will fix my one negative memory about this game - dealing with LAN connections."
"This game is amzing! Very addicting, very fun, up to 8 players multiplayer or battle with AI, this game has it all and with so many civilitations to choose from the DLC 'the forgoten' the game is endless! Now if only steam had Age of Mythology. Mabey one day."
Such a great game! Highly recommended.
"One of my favorite RTS games. If you've played Total War, or Starcraft, or any other good RTS, you will love Age of Empires."
dont play this game
Great game. Soo much better then the original. DLCS rock. 10/10 and a game everyone needs to get.
"Very good rts, played it a ton as a kid and I still love it a whole lot to this day"
excellent game-play with the remastered graphics means for smoother control and enhanced enjoyment
"This game makes you think better in various ways as attacking and defending your civilization, Wether you're on the offensive or defensive and this HD remastered version makes it better, it doesn't actually change any visuals it just makes it compatible with HD monitors and TVs"
"YOU KNOW SOMETHING MEAN GENE THE HULKSTER HAS RESPECT FOR THE LEGENDS AND THIS GAME IS A TRUE LEGEND OF THE REAL TIME STRATEGY GENRE, JACK. WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THE SCENARIOS OR A PREMADE GAME YOU CAN BUILD YOUR KEEP FROM THE GROUND UP TO GO OVER THE FORGEIN HORDES TO BECOME THE LAND'S CHAMPION OF CHAMPIONS, JUST LIKE THE HULKSTER BROTHER. THE ONLY THING THIS GAME IS MISSING IS AMERICA, BROTHER, BECAUSE IF I REALLY WANT TO CONQUER THE WORLD I WANT TO DO IT IN THE GOOD OL U S OF A."
"One of the best RTS I've ever played. If you love to command little pixels into their deaths and cause buildings to burn by hitting them with swords, then this is the right game."
"A great RTS, still holds up"
a classic game that is kept alive through this HD re-release. now if only they bring age of mythology to steam
"Nice re-make from the original, Love it, recommend for anyone who enjoys the original or similar games"
"Fun game, Hours of entertainment!"
"Great game like it has always been. Word of Warning: though it says its an HD release, graphically it is not that much better. I also recommend getting the Forgotten Expansion."
i've been playing this game since 1999 and i still haven't stopped! always relevant!
I played the origional years ago and this game brings back so many memories of how much i loved age of empires :)
"Great game, enjoy it a lot!"
A competent refresh of a fantastic classic - worth getting again.
"Back in the days, when I first played this game on the Playstation 2, my aim was to create an army full of terrifying elephants to completely stomp out the existence of my enemies. Alas, I must have been using witchcraft because this method sadly no longer works. Or I suck. Or both. Regardless, I have sunk a few hours into Age of Empires II this evening without having any intention too, and I think I know why.  It's so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun.  Now bare with me, I have never played Civilisation. I touched StarCraft 2 once. Strategy games are not exactly my forte. But for reasons that I'm going to do my best to explain, Age of Empires really sucked me in. Addmitedly, I have only played just over 3 hours on Steam, but as I have stated above, many more hours have went into a different variation of this game in the past. I think the best way to describe this game and why I enjoy it so much is to give a brief run through of the events of this evening.  I wasn't feeling too confident to begin with that my super terrifying elephant attack from the sea strategy was going to work against other people who actually might be half competent at playing the game, so I vouched for a singleplayer game to ease me back into the lull of mass slaughter. I naturally chose to play as the Japanese, because Samurais, and I fought against two bots.   I think what surprised me most about the game is how quickly I managed to grasp it again. Everything goes in a fairly logical progressions as to which building you can construct next and so I was quickly building my little city. Fast forward two hours later and things have become far more intense. One bot is on my left and the other is on my right. They can't get at each other without going through me, which was suffice to say a slight inconvenience for my peaceful Japanese Samurai Farming haven that I was constructing. And then the two gold veins that I had been mining at since the beginning up and exhausted their supplies, forcing me to create complete autarky and creating my own farming economy, by selling the food that I produced for gold at decreasing rates.   So just to recap, I went from a person who hadn't played the game in nigh on 7-8 years to a person who was by the end of two hours trying to create his own economy.   Alas, my band of Samurai annihilated the filthy Aztecs and Celts, so I proceeded onwards with a cocky smile to the Multiplayer section of the game, believing that maybe my silly tactics would work.  *sigh*  I was ready this time. For a solid 45-60mins my opponent and myself were doing some hardcore resource gathering (a lot more fun than you would think, take my word on it) I decided to end our frosty staelmate with a Return of the King scale esque battle. I carted one of my villagers and my whole army onto my boats, sailed on over to his island, deployed and set up a second base, proceeding to make my army right up his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (I feel like there is a clever joke to be made here, alas, I am not clever).  My army assembled, I charged at his town with reckless abandon, only to discover that he too was building an army and attacking me at the same moment! I engage but I begin to see that it is hopeless. He had advanced further down the progression than me. I was truly a weaker resource farmer. Darn. Akin to Leonidas, my merry band of soldiers charged at his town hall, to go out with a bang. He had a castle and my army died instantaenously resulting in my resignation of the rights to command such a noble civilisation such as the Mongolians.  And that is my story. So you might be thinking, 'You didn't address a single point that normal reviewers touch on'. True, but I think that is the beauty of the game. The graphics, although improved but still looking dated, mattered little. The repetitive crys made by my peasants discouraged me not. The bombastic and somewhat odd music only encouraged me to slay more enemies. These things mattered little because Age of Empires II is an incredibly entertaining game, and I look forward to watching many more hours of my potentially precious hours go down the toilet as I attempt to assert my dominance over strangers on the internet.  Recommended."
One of my favorite games of all time. Remastered in glorious HD. Well worth your time and any time it is on sale it is a STEAL.
A must in library !
"Great classic, spent so much time as a young teen playing this."
"The classic game we all loved, updated for modern hardware and OSs."
This is a game
24
"Age of Empires II is one of my favourite games of all time. The amount of hours you can get out of this game is phenominal; I have been playing this game from the year it was released and I'm stil not done with it! AoE is perfect in many ways; it is one of the finest strategy games out there, and still has a thriving online community. There are a wide variety of civilizations to choose from, and The Forgotten expansion provides even more. Steam provides this game with trading cards and a couple hundred achievements, which are nice additions to this classic."
"If you loved the original AOE2, this game re-creates it in all of its glory! This is the game how I remember it, not how it actually looks if I booted it up today. Very much worth the purchase :)"
"Classy, don't expect anything new. Basically it's the old good game AoE 2 in HD. Best game of all time."
"Classic RTS at it's best, the mechanics are simple to understand and gameplay is enjoyable and challanging. The historcal campains you play through are unquie, each level though having the same basic objectives throws all diffrent sorts of situations and challanges, and even the nations you play are unquie, even though each is playing with the exact same set of units and buildings, each have unquie strengths and weaknesses with their own defining unit. Along with Steam offering servers to reinvigorate the online gameplay, I would suggest this to new and old-school RTS fans alike."
I SAT PLAY THIS GAME BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME.
Better than great
if you don´t buy this game you´r a fool!
"Can't reccomend enough, the original was fantastic and this adds to it."
AWWWW YEAH! My childhood youth game!
"Age of Empires 2 was a game of my childhood. It was a fantastic strategy game and I loved every second of it. I'm not ashamed to say that I gained a lot of historical knowledge from the campaigns and wow'ed my childhood friends with it. So now a new HD version with a long awaited expansion pack has been released I am more than happy to replay this game and rekindle my love for it and fulfill the nostalga nagging at me. Gameplay is as great as ever and with the new added campaigns there is so much more gameplay to explore; all topped off with rather fantastic soundtrack. I'm aware that online play is also an option, but that's not something I really take part in with any game. (But may explore in the future)  So overall, I would say that it is highly recommened to those who love thier history and/or stratagy games.  Fully recommended (but I am ever so slightly biased)."
Game of the Year 1999. Still got it.
I freaking love this game! You guys should get it!
One of the greatest RTS of all time. Spent countless hours playing this when I was younger. No excuse to not have this in your collection.
"I love this game. No matter how old it is, it is still so much fun to play with my friends, building civilizations to fight the enemy or playing against each other. While it still takes a long time, it takes less time than Civ5, and I personally enjoy playing it more. I hope anyone who plays it enjoys it as much as I do!"
"Well, Age of Empires II was a huge part of my childhood, I loved it so much when I was little! And when they released the HD version of the game, I was hyped to the max! Sadly, there's a lot of problems not accountable for, the sluggy movements of controlling troops makes the game less enjoyable! This is on turbo mode with castle units mind you.  I can't speak for people actually taking time to play the game non-turbo, It's probably a lot better!  Also, when playing online, if someone in your team / enemy team have poor ping/internet the whole game lags."
"One of my favorite RTS games ever. It has so much depth as you manage both a powerful army and build your own civilization. Very fun online, however it is not perfect. The online has some trouble with lag which for this game you want need every second so that you can build your base faster than your opponent. It does not have much new features from when it was first released but that honestly does not matter. The original game was amazing and so is this."
"Same game, but with support for higher resolutions and steam workshop content.   The steam workshop content really enhances things (new textures, blood, fire trees etc) so a big thumbs up to the contributors as i see this as the single biggest draw to play this over the original with a HD Hack installed.  "
10/10
Excellent wonderful game! Loved it when I was 12 and love it even more so now that I am 22! You must buy this- absolutley lovely game! 10/10!
Good ol' classic - though the AI is still dumb and the pathfinding is horrible.  Sometimes you'll get no achievements after a match and I don't know why.  P.S.: Wololo!
Can play this game for hours o;
Awesome game. worth it.
"Played as a kid and bought it again, ive missed this game great game all around."
Great game!
Literally the best RTS of all time
"Still good, easier access to multiplayer then the original, theres a complete texture replacer on steam work shop, that also makes it look alot more crisp too."
Pretty Good
Just like how I remember it from my childhood.
Just as good as I remember and it doesn't have the issues my CD copy has.
"AoE II, but in HD! A great and simple RTS"
Great classic game only made better by having modern multiplayer support via Steam!
yes! i recommend this more than i recommend my ♥♥♥! which i dont recommend... but still! THIS GAME IS LIKE....ICE CREAM! ITS GOOD!!!
"Seems more stable now, good purchase"
"brilliant game, endless hours of fun"
"This game definitely brings back memories, plus, I am amazed that they came out with an expansion pack 14 YEARS after it was released. It's a really great RTS game, and even with paying full Steam price, it's worth it. I have yet to actually play any expansion content, but I'm sure it'll be just as great as the base game."
best ever to get into the new year.
This game is a classic. Everyone of us has played AoE sometimes and we all know what this game is. You can spend hours just building your own empire and see it rise from nothing. AI is good enough at least with forgotten dlc and updates it brought. Even without it AI is good enough but sometimes it crashes and enemies don't do nothing. But mostly this game works almost percectly and is quite nice looking with HD. I'll give it 9/10
Hard to believe such an old game could still be so much fun to play. This game is all of the wins :3
"Any1 who like strategy game, will enjoy AoE2 :) I can't stop playing."
A classic game that I grew up with. I remember playing this with cousins and friends. I love the fact that it has returned unchanged.
My childhood remastered.
So bueno I play very much like   I never wanna stop
"This game was one of the few I played as a kid. History, RTS and a huge amount of replayability. It brings back great memories, and the dev's have done a great job fixing bugs and balancing."
So glad I can play this again without crappy graphics issues :)
"Love this game completely. It's exactly how I remember it years ago playing as a child and it's something I'm extremely happy they re-released. Although I rarely touch the multiplayer side of things, it's still pretty decent for a game of its age and I think we a few improvements could be a wonderful game for people of all ages along with new, or old gamers."
Used to play this when I was younger - it's still that good.
This game is my childhood now broght back in hd and its amazing and addicting! WHORTH BUYING!!!!!!!
Great game. But not worth $19. Get it on sale.
"Loved the original and i like this one too, i would like more textures and some new nature models though"
"My first online RTS, a true classic. Really glad thay brought it back! single player or multiplayer its really enjoyable with base building and economy management, Make sure u have time on ur hands becouse u could be in a match for hours! 10/10"
Love this game! Played it a ton when I was young. And now that I have it again I plan to play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Definitely recommend this game.
"Can't say enough about this game.   One of my very first experiences with PC gaming, AoEII was an awe-inspiring idea and execution.  I would spend hours building my civilization from dirt into a powerhouse that could defend its walls in real time, whilst trampling over enemy troops halfway across the map at the same time.   I'm not sure if there was a bigger rush in gaming than amassing a large army to make a final assault on the enemy's castle to claim victory, putting all of your hard work to the ultimate test.  -----  -The graphics, although aged, are still surprisingly pleasant to look at 14 years later.  -This game's focus on history, (no lie), made me into a history buffat age nine; campaigns like Joan of Arc &amp; William Wallace are memorable &amp; fun. -There are multiple strategies to defeating your enemies; will you take the total war approach and heave massive forces at your opponent until they can't fight back, or cut off their resources and bleed them dry, striking at them with skirmishes?  The addition of the Steam Workshop can add HOURS of content  -----  All in all, this is one of my favorite games ever. I will admit, I was nervous about nostalgia clouding my judgement; but it hasn't. Not in the least bit.   Instant buy."
Classic and All time favourite Game.
Awesome game for playing with family and friends!
"The Age of Empires Series is like the Grand Series of all RTS games.   The economy/military aspect is very much important in this game. Fails your economy, your military units will be smashed into pieces and the other way around.  The best balance must be found... and then my friend... you will be the true ruler of all Empires!  So... what are you waiting for? Get Age of Empires 2 HD where you can be the ruler of 18 civilisations, in 9 campaigns with 57 scenarios and a great Multiplayer action!"
"Strongly recommend AOE2 HD to anyone who has ever liked RTS style games. The upgrades made to AOE2HD make this game worth the purchase, even if you already own AOE2... Things like full screen and steam integration for multiplayer make life a breeze. If you don't own this, get it!"
"Look, It's Age of Empires II. Enough info."
"NOSTALGIA !! Loved it as a child, loved it as a teen, and still loving it. A few good games don't need to be 'upgraded' with a ♥♥♥♥♥on of DLC's, new engine remakes. Some games are just good old fashioned good.   This being a wonderful example."
"Really amazing game to play by yourself, or with friends. The fact that I can keep coming back to this game and enjoy it is just awesome, not many games can do that. Since I have owned this game since something like 2007, I will say and continue to say that I love it."
"Absolute classic, get it and give me a game!"
"Really awesome classic game, if you ever played Age of Empires in your childhood you love this!"
Quite difficult but enjoyable. AI cheats which makes it very interesting.
"Great Game, Good Graphics"
Definitly worth buying
The 1st and 3rd are better in my opinion but this game fits the series pretty well too.
"I played this game when it was realeased in 1999 on disc and I play it now in 2013on steam. A brilliant work of HD, a mastepiece of game play."
Issues with lag in Multiplayer. Good game nevertheless.
I really like that they updated the graphics for today's machines. it really makes a difference.
"Not really much needed to say about this classic strategy Titan. After more than a decade, still very exciting title to play.."
"I love AoE2. It has been one of my most favourite games since i was just a wee lad. So seeing this updated version with a couple of extra expansion packs it, well it brings a tear to my eye. Highly recommend and get the gift pack to give to friends its deffinatly worth it."
"Just as much fun as I remember it being as a kid, this is for anyone who is a fan of classic RTS."
play for 3 hours and lose every game
Brings back memories :D After all these years it has pretty solid gameplay and graphics. Thumbs up 
"Love this game, first off all it brings back great memories of my childhood, but it does more than that. the new empires are awsome and I really enjoyed playing the new campaigns that were added. Unfortunatly the AI is buggy along with many other sections of the HD version, but I personally thought the game was worth just the extra senarios and having steam workshop support."
"Still by far one of the best RTS Games out there, this is really the 'BEES KNEES'. Along with the nastalgic feeling I feel as if everything about this game cries out. 'I AM THE BEST AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST.' In its own area, Age of Empires has really made its stamp on gaming history. As much as I dislike all the new phone apps. This game will always have a place in my library."
Timeless game. It's brilliant. Obviously the best of the 3.
"One of the very best RTS ever made! If you don't know it, buy and play it, now!"
Love this! Reminds me of the old days. :D
"Oh so many memories are flooding back to me playing this game. I am thrilled to see Age of Empires 2 return to the gaming scene. I can't think of a more perfect excecution either, steam seems to be the perfect platform for this historic game. With the increased multiplayer support and the use of the steam workshop to share and enjoy each other's mods/maps is superb.  Was also pleased to see this game has added more content in addition to the rather noticable graphical changes. I can't really fault the game, it's exactly as I remember it. While vastly improved it still has that same nostalgic feel with the addition of a fresh feel, like I am stepping into it all over again. I would like to thank the developers at Hidden Path and Ensemble Studios for doing this game justice in this remastered edition. Fabulous job! Highly recommend it to anyone, even if you didn't play the original this a worthwhile game to buy.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mate on the other line bugging me for a rematch and I particularly want to get him back for ruining my wonder victory ;)."
Now you can convert catapults to christianity while you set stonewall on fire with swords and ask your only villager to repair your Wonder...  ... in High Definition.
"I have played this game on-and-off for just over half of my life, and I've absolutely no intention of stopping any time soon. It's the best RTS game ever made if not the best game period. As for the HD Edition, it felt kind of wonky at first, but the Steam Workshop integration and the numerous patches have made it well worth the pricetag."
Playing since original realese No better MEDIEVIL period rts PERIOD!!
one of the classics you just have to comeing back to it
"Pure Classic, got this for free with Windows 2000 back in the day. Still holds up today."
I really love the old version of this game but this new update is awesome too! I also got the new Forgotten extension.
"This is a very fun and addicting game because you can control all your army and citizens. You can also do multiplayer with 8 of your friends! Multiplayer is so fun because it is very tactical, challenging and fun to play with all your friends! Plus you don't need a very good computer to run it. Overall very good"
"Very awesome game. Finally a good and stable opportunity to play against other AoE II players. And now even more awesome with The Forgetton, first expansion in 10 years. Buy this game."
"This was one of my favorite games as a kid. My old copies don't work anymore so I was happy to pick this up when it came out. The campaign missions are a lot of fun, and provide some light history."
"Age of Empires II HD resurrects the 1999 Classic and adds modern features. It offers an excellent blend of pacing and economic developement, sitting somewhere in betweeen other games of the RTS genre such as Starcraft II and Stronghold. With ever-evolving strategies and plenty of action, Age of Empires II HD is sure to keep you on your toes, but is also friendly to new players at the lower difficulty levels."
"Does not look terribly updated, but still the same fun. People who liked the extra micromanaging that is absent from III will like this. Worth the buy on sale to play now, especially if you lost a copy/are no longer able to play an old copy."
"Highly recommended. If you love real-time strategy games, this is the classic to beat all classics. Best RTS of all time, by most accounts (sorry Starcraft players, but there is more economy/resource management in AoE IN ADDITION TO the same amount of army micro as there is in SC). This re-released edition is great for both fans of AoE II who are looking to get a version that plays on newer operating systems and newcomers to the series who want to get into RTS games or AoE specificially."
One of the best strategy games trough all time.
Game of the century. A must have.
"Amazing game. Fav strategy game of all time. Start from having 4 villagers, to using tons of army and buildings."
"If you already have a working copy of AoE: II, this may not be worth your money. However, if you have friends that will play with you on steam, or you don't yet own this game, this is a must have for anyone who likes RTS's"
"A very fun RTS game that has many different campaigns to play through, but even if you don't enjoy RTS games you can still have fun with this. There are custom made scenarios by players from way back in 2000 all the way up to 2013 and they can be anything from RPGs, racing, being hunted by a player and more. You'll easily get your $5 worth out of this game if you play with me."
"I remember pouring countless hours into a prior release of this game. As soon as I heard it was being updated for modern systems, I wanted to pick it up. While I was never could best my older brother at this game, I still had loads of fun playing. Now, years later, I can share that experience with friends, old and new, through steam's multiplayer services.  There are still some issues with this release, but the developer is very dedicated to getting them resolved. One of the main new features I like is the option to customize EVERY hotkey in the game. (read: GRID keys)  While I don't believe this is worth the $20 USD regular price, if you can find it on sale I'd say buy it."
Solid rework of the best RTS of all time. graphics mods make this a damn fine treat to play (not to mention steam workshop + matchmaking).
If you liked Empire Earth (the first one) then you will probably love this game.
Does not work for some older computers with integrated graphics. A couple of my friends along with thousands of others have found that out the hard way. If you have a pretty new computer then you should have no issues.
"All the magic of 1999 medieval RTS, in HD!"
"It's not as good as the original game with mods like UserPatch or the voobly lobby system, but it's got a lower barrier of entry and it's really easy to use. The developers are still working on it actively, too, which is nice. Hopefully in the future it will be the best version of the game out there."
This game is so fun to play with your friends. GET IT! 
"I am a fan of this game, i was hoping that the HD version of the game give me less problems on windows 7 that using the standard version I was looking to play the Forgotten Empires in HD.  The Bad -------- - It took me many hours to be able to run the game. I had two problems, the texts didn´t appear and then a starting the campaing crashed the program Looks that it was fixed changing the language of the game from Spanish to English but i did a lot of the workarounds and solutions described in the steam forums so am not 100% sure if tht fixed it. - The AI (Artificial Intelligence) of The Forgotten it is not there, with the Forgotten Empires AI it is very difficult to me to beat one machine oponent in hard, but in this version i could beat two machine players in hardest difficult very easily. It will be nice if the include options to select the AI algorithms from the forgotten. - Looks like they removed LAN Party   The Good ---------- -I am using a 720p monitor and i see some litle improvements like textures over the standard non HD version i cannot talk about the 1080p monitors, It is better integrated with windows 7 ALT+TAB always works and colors are good, the water is in 3D -The limit of population is now 500 -They added ranked games  My puntuation of the game is 6.5/10"
"I have Always returned to this title since 2001, this is a timless classic. I would recommend this game for both young children and adults. In Age of Empires: the Age of Kings (AOE) you take the role of one of manny nations building up a civilization through the dark ages through to the imperial age. gathering wood, food, stone, and gold allows you to build new villagers, buildings, troops, and seige engines. The game can be set for many variable winning conditions. This game also has a great Single player campaign with historically based epics such as william wallice, jon of arch, gangus khan, and so on. This game comes with its own editor which enables you to create single &amp; Multi-player campaigns, multi player maps, and scenarios, that hads hours of game play for years to come. This is a nestalgic title that should just be in your libarary."
It's loads of fun even to this day.
"Best RTS ever, i love this game, it has no age and no end you can always have fun and improve your skills, each map and game is different, you can try infinite kinds of strategies and tricks.  10/10"
"THIS GAME IS EPIC, my cousin and I play for hours on end.   Such a classic RPG!"
"Best RTS I've ever played, my time played truely doesn't reflect the hours upon hours I used to play this game as a kid. 10/10 would recommend"
"This was an amazing game back in the day, it is even better now due to the addition of DLC and it being on steam. This a great buy for anyone."
"It's everything awesome that I remember from 1999 plus more since I never actually owned the Conquerors expansion (which comes with a base purchase of AoE II Extended Edition). There were some serious issues with performance and stuttering when it was first released but they seem to have rectified it for the most part as of writing this. The Steam Workshop integration is great and full of lots of good mods. If you were a big fan of the original like I am and would like to play it smoothly on modern hardware, this is $20 well spent."
One of my all time favourite games! worth all your money! buy it! I've been playing on and off for about 14 years!
Best Realtime Strategy game ever!
The original LAN party strategy game! This game has made and broken alot of friendships throughout the years
really good and addictive game highly reccomended to anyone that likes stragergy games the graphics arnt the best and the campaign is hard and cheaply made but you should buy this game for the online and the online only because it is just an amazing game and loads of different gameplays such as deathmatch or normal where you have to gether resouces and then go up ages.
"This game has been the game my family and I spend playing on our family game nights since I was 8. As one of the first RTS games I have ever played. There is definitely a lot of pre-reading or preparation you should do to understand the game, otherwise, you will be left really confused. Understanding the strengths of the civilization you pick is key to doing well in the game. Like many games, mastering Age of Empires II comes with time, and exposure to the game.  Offering more than just standard deathmatch games, the variety of games allows for each civilization to excel at certain game modes. The campaign offeres multiple stories about some historical heros that won many battles. Each scenario will test your combat abilities, and help you develop stronger tactics. Perhaps you are feeling more creative than stratigic, well then the Map Editor is your go to sandbox! With full access to all the games enviornment editing tools, the possibilites are almost endless. All in all, this game is definitely in the 9.5/10 range in my book."
Awesome game. Works on W10 now :D
this game is great i love rts's i am 26 and played this when i was 8 years old and its  got better visual's gameplay is the same and the sounds are a little in hanced  though that could be my 7.1 7h usb sourround steelseries headphone :P   Total socre :  Gameplay    Visuals
"It has been a long time since Age of empires 2 was originally released. Yet it still is the best pure RTS game ever, which is at the same time an incredible accomplishment and a reminder of the horrible current (2013) state of RTS genre. If you have never played Age of empires 2 you have missed a lot of fun.  Grade: 10/10"
"Sure it's pricey but should you be lucky enough to spot it on sale, waste no second more.  Modified to run more stable on modern systems and with far better support of less than a decade old hardware, you'll have your chance to relive your greatest gaming moments more beautifully, more intense and with greater ease.  On top of some minor graphical updates, high resolutions, higher FPS, higher pop limits and higher number of units selected are supported. And let's not forget the ease of online games with 8 players and support for co-op... shame on the design oversights of AoE III."
"Age of Empires II is a faithful rerelease of the original title - for better or for worse.   The game is the same right down to the intro movies - low res and pixelated as all heck, but exactly as I remember them. The landing menu is the same, and the game plays exactly as it should.  Playing online with some friends, both the nostalgic good and bad comes out. The AI is still as rudimentary as it used to be, which can make pathfinding and attacking occasionally frustrating. For example, I was attacking an enemy civilization, and instructed foot units to follow seige weapons into battle. A one point, the seige weapons attack a town centre, and the entire foot group follows suit, taking splash damage from my own units in the process. When you get used to these (20 year) shortcomings though, they begin to seem charming.  One unique, interesting aspect of the game is that you can play with a friend on the same team. This allows you to strategize in a much easier, more fun way than as allies, because you can create rolls and efficiently defend and attack. That's one thing I used to love about AoE2 when I was younger, and I was glad to see it intact.  It's a little expensive at $19.99, but I felt that it was worth it since I used to love the game. Your mileage may vary though."
"All the good along with the bad of the original. Great classic game. That being said. Terrible AI pathing and multiplayer synchronization issues that existed in the original. Down to the last line of code. Still great being HD 1080p though, with working matchmaking lobbies and Steam Workshop. If you can get past the drawbacks of the original the only thing I can say is good luck finding friends to play with. This game will forever be a classic in my book."
"Can't beat the good memories this game brings back. Great for new players as well, maybe a bit less complicated than III. WOLOLO!"
"This game is terrible. At no point during this rambling, incoherent game was it even close to anything that could be considered a real videogame. Everyone who has played this game is now dumber for having played it. I award Age of Empires II HD no points, and may God have mercy on its soul."
Who knew history could be so much fun. Wolololo
"For better or for worse, the gameplay (including the cheat codes) and graphics are completely unchanged from the 1999 original, except that the engine can now properly render on Windows 7 at widescreen resolutions.  The Conquerors expansion is also included for an even sweeter deal.  Mods and user-made maps are fully supported via Steam workshop. Multiplayer uses Steamworks.  If you enjoyed the original but don't want to resort to using hamachi for multiplayer, buy this game!"
"If you buy this game, you can play it with meeeee! Oh and it's excellent just fyi. But you knew that. C'mon. It's AOE2. But HD!!!!!1!!!21 (may not be hd)."
i love it becuase it gives me erectoins 
Awesome strategy game for all peeps!
"Classic strategy game, one of the best of all time. I'd missed playing this, so glad to see it on Steam. Sooo addictive! So many variations, great replayability, and the multiplayer just kicks it up another notch. What are you waiting for??"
Great game to buy if you are a AoE 2 fanatic! Only con about this game is that the online gameplay is laggy.
"The original version of this game was absolutely amazing! This remake is just as great! Aside from just being fun to play this game is also very educational if you play through the campaigns. You can learn all about significant figures in history like Joan of Arch, Genghis Khan, or Montezuma to name a few. Throw in the custom map making and you've got an amazing game. Highly recommend it!"
"IGN/10 would wolololo again.  A classic that has aged well. This happened to be one of the first games I ever played when I was a kid. And even though I was never a great player, I still loved this game. Its an awesome RTS and im so glad to see it on steam and getting content updates.   I reccomend this because: +its a fun game to play solo or with friends +gameplay is skill based (not luck) +f you're a fan of the old version, this is a good choice because of new content (and steam workshop) +working multiplayer, with the option to save mp games and continue another time  +has a competitive side to it +nostalgia  +well made singleplayer campaigns +good map/scenario editor +plenty of civilizations to play which means multiple playstyles    "
"This wont open. Please help, I am a student and need AOE in my life"
Very similar to the original game. There are no real graphic changes and the fire animatins are bugged. The Gameplay is exactly like the old game. But still it's a great game. Buy it when it's in the sale
They finally updated the game and the FPS issue I had are now gone!  You should get it :D
A faithfull port of a classic masterpiece
all I ever wanted
"People ♥♥♥♥♥ing because they don't see any 'HD' yet they don't understand 'HD' is just a way to say up high resolutions. Was a little buggy at release but devs are definitely working on it. Brings back good old times and multiplayer works great using Steamworks. Worth the admission price, good luck getting the 200+ achievements hehe."
"The patch fixed the game to playable level, everything is back to fun level Highly recomended for the fans of old school rts , history based games . The single player missions are great and multiplayer.... well try to play with friends who are not pros at the game for more fun vs cpu than pvp 'Sweet joan....i shall avenge thee'"
"This game is fun as hell, from my childhood."
"If you enjoyed Age of Empires II, then you will love that you can now natively play it at 1920x1080"
Classic!
"Easily my favorite computer game in high school. I'd spend hours playing this game. It's got nostalgia for me, but any fan of rts's that haven't played this should!"
"It is literally the first game I ever played. It's fun, but the only gripe I have with it is that everyone seems better at it then me. :( But it also taught me a lot about history and geography too. Overall, it's probably just my nostalgia. "
"Age of Empiers 2 was my 1st game. I grew up with it and now i found it on steam again. So many memories and so good game. If u think to buy it, just do it. Just play with friends and it will be so fun.  "
it's a nice game. you can play it for a long time and still will not get bored :D
Age of Empires............Its...Age of Empires...Everybody who says 'AOE SUCKS YOO' are these 12 year old CoD kids who fap while cheating....Shortly said only trolls and idiots say that 
"This game is VERY addictive. Playing as any ancient civilizations from the Byzantine Empire, to the Ottoman Turks. Playing online does take some time getting used to, as everyone likes to get castles very fast.   I would also like to mention, this game isn't very historically accurate, while you should mostly focus on the gameplay.    "
"Best game ever, used to play it when i was young, 10/10"
This is one of my favorite games from my childhood and I'm so glad it is on Steam now!
"Best game ever, brought back in HD. i must have 4000h of it offline. and 500 on hd edition this is the game you can escape to, if ur just doing multiplayer.. or challenging 1v7 hardest new AI's. its a blast.  I recommend this to everyone =)."
An ultimate classic. RTS at it's finest.
"The greatest RTS ever made period. With the online mods and game modes people have created there are so many different ways to play this game, from tower defense games to all out mayhem in castle blood. However this wouldnt be possible without the core game which is truly excellent and has not been topped by any RTS in my opinion. 10/10"
Just Like Age of Empires II but this one is HD... cpt.obvios strikes again.
One of the best games I've played for the PC!!
warcraft rip off lol. castles? try wc3 idiots. how is this $20 when its stolen copyright content
"A great classic strategy game that will provide hours of fun. The steam version actually works in multiplayer. It can still get a little laggy but atleast you can finish the game. If you enjoyed playing this in the past, it deserves a revisit."
"This game brings back so much good memories for me.  I played Age of Empires II back when I was a kid and a teenager. The Graphics it had for then were amazing! I really didn't want to play any other game.  The game pretty much is still the same, a old RTS, but it's nice and good fun.  You literally, build an Empire, starting with one Town Center.  To any fans of RTS', you'll like this game, and if you never heard of it before, shame on you! :U  It's worth the purchase."
"Honestly it took me a while if i wanted to say Yes or No to this, they say it is HD but it still looks the same. It is a very old game and i played this alot durring my childhood it is really fun loading into a skermish with friends or just playing the campain. Dont get me wrong its a decent game, but it is not High Definition."
"I've played this game since it originally came out. It's the closest thing to a medieval Starcraft you could ask for. Great graphics, tons of match customization and the historical campaigns are a blast! There are also hundreds of amazing user-created campaigns and maps to discover. 15 years later and I can't get enough of it!"
Brings back memories of old. Still fun to play after all these years. A ++
"This game is a war-based empire-builder. It is a real-time strategy (RTS). It's very similar to the CIV series (or at least what I've seen of it)  I Like: Scenario builder (when I have time, it's a nice little tool) Monks (If protected, they can be extremely useful.) Medieval gameplay (I personally like the whole midieval/early renaissance thing in video games.) Game in general (I personally think it could be slightly less war-oriented, but all-in-all, it's a great game)  I'm not very good at the whole constant-movement, but it doesn't ruin the game.  (In case I pushed the wrong button, I do reccomend this. :)) "
great game!
"Used to play Age of Empires all the time when I was in Middle School, this game is great and i would definitely recommend it to any one!"
Probably everyone knows this game from their childhood etc. and have very good memories. So now we have it remastered in HD and with full steam workshop support... what is more important - multiplayer is alive so if you liked it before you will fall in love with it again... for hours/days/weeks. Trust me. I did.
"I played over 500 hours on Age of Empires II when it came out. This review is for the HD version. +The graphics aren't too different... but the water looks good. +Multiplayer is full of players +Map Editor is friendly to new players +A lot of campaigns +People can easily upload maps and mods to the Steam Workshop +Good skirmishes, especially if playing with friends +Good tutorial, teaches new players about the game +A lot of history can be learned from this game -You have to pay for the forgotten DLC, which has a few more campaigns -Cheats can easily ruin a game, unless disabled by the host... but nothing stops you from using cheats on singleplayer. -Objectives are hard to find, you must explore the map to find the path.  Score: 9.5/10. You shouldn't pay for DLCs you already have.  Good game, for new players and veteran players alike.  "
Its Age of Empires! If you didnt play this growing up you are a cheeky scrub.
"best rts ever, fun as heck and u can play it whenever ezpz 10/10 would buy if on sale"
"Loved this game as a kid, and its just as i remember and more"
Reminds me of the good old days.
great game 
awesome game.  fuch her right in the pussssay
"This game is just as good as I remembered it. I wish they would do graphical updates on more classic games like this. Don't change the game play, just make it look awesome!"
Age of Empires II HD is a great game! If you are looking for a fun medieval RTS this is it. Build up your base and army by gathering resources and then destroy your enemies. 5 Stars!!!
"loads of fun, the new HD graphics are great, the ai is brutal(i think they cheat)."
I really feel there could have been some gameplay mechanic changes from the original. This is literally almost like the original with hd visuals. Nothing too fancy just okay.
One of the best games i've ever played
Great game! Loads of fun!
this is the best game in the francise so far. 10/10
this is a classic game
"I don't know what I can type about this game, other than that it is quite possible the greatest RTS ever made. You should buy it, immediately."
If (you love strategic games); System.out.println('Buy this game'); else System.out.println('Forget about this');
this game bring's me back to high school it was very fun then and still is very fun now . love the better AI makes the game very fun also you can have more then one of the Civilization on the game so you can see how the AI plays the same Civilization as you . has a better amont of Civilization to play as 13 i think with the forgoten
great game i highly recomend it. I tried to recomend it to my friend and finaly got him to get it and he loved it. definately worth the price.
"One of the few games that I've always kept around. When my original disk finally stopped working I knew it was time to get the HD version. A simple RTS, but still one of the best."
this game is really gr8
its nice 
you HD ♥♥♥♥ing quality lowered my fps drastically + over priced 4/10
"It just lke the good old days in AoE II ! A linux version would have been just great (I know it IS too much to ask in this case, but still ... )"
"brilliant game to get if you enjoyed Age of Kings and don't want to spend a day or two tromping through websites looking for a color fix for Windows 7 or 8 PC/Laptops or just got a spare $20 lying around. $10 extra gets you The Forgotten X-Pack and the 5 new races it adds, so now you can kick ♥♥♥ with Italians! and the addition of the Attack Move button was a excellent move on their part, no more clicking on individual buildings, just Attack Move and pillage, loot and destroy away! (just be sure to check defensive mode still)"
"Hello, this is my review to one of my favorite games, Age of Empires II. Keep in mind this is my personal opinion, you may have another! Age of Empires is one of the best series of Strategy-games and a long time favorite of mine. It certainly is better then the first one and, in a the eyes of a lot of people, also still better then the third. I lost dozens of hours playing this game alone and with my friends. For both options, this game shines! It may not be the most up to date game out there and may not be as awesome for new people as it is for us fans, but you can be sure that this game is worth you're money! Now to a bit more information: You play as one of 13 different civilizations and conquer you're vivals in battle while you try to advance to the next of four 'Ages'. There are multiple kinds of military units which are further divided in differnet weapon kinds. There also are a lot of buildings and even more upgrades which you unlock by advancing to the next age. Gathering recources to buy those upgrades, build the buildings there used in or directly recruit soldiers. To come to an end, I would highly recommend this game for everyone who likes strategy games. If you're looking for good grafics though you should look at Age of Empires 3, but if you're like I am and don't care about the grafics as long as the gameplay is good, you will love this game! I hope I helped someone, regards harlekintiger"
This game has alot more campaigns. It is really fun to play.
A classic! YOLOLOL!
Brings back good memories!
"This game is is amazing to play LAN. Very fun with friends, campaigne for yourself, and passes time extremely fast!"
"Great Game Remade... and it still holds up well, Amazing."
I like the cars
Great Game Works well Looks better in hd mode Normal game has contrast problem so get this one multi play is good too :)  Remember this has i think all the DLC's for it too :) SO YAY ***** 5 star out of 5 for me :D
"This game looks beautiful compared to the original that has purple water now. The problem I have with this game though is that it is lagging a lot more then it used to. I was very frustrated when I was being attacked and my game was lagging so much that I was unable to even interact with anything. On a happier note, I do enjoy the new added content that is on the game that originally I did not have."
this is one of the best games ever. highly recomend it to all
"Age of Empires II is a fantastic game. If you were of fan of the game originally, simply being able to play the game again is worth the price tag. Thoroughly enjoy this game and I'm glad to have it in my collection again."
"Pretty decent remake; could have done more, but not bad for the $5 i paid for it."
this game is good
"This is the same game. But after 10 years they improved somethings, they added Ranked games, water in HD *sigh* , and a good multiplayer synchronized with Steam.   30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30  Just play and Wololo 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 "
"Learning new tactics, methods of playing etc. is always fun, the ability to play as a team (or a single village) with your friend(s) is a pretty good feature too."
A graphically updated version of one of my favorite classic games. A solid RTS that I still enjoy!
Great game!
"Really fun game, too bad the servers are lagging like crazy"
"village attacks building with dagger, building catches fire aztec house made of stone cost wood"
"Thanks to Steam, I can once again enjoy one of the first strategy games I ever played, plus a little more. It will always be a classic in my heart. Also thanks to Steam, I feel like a total dumbass because I got it a day before it was 75% off!! Thanks, Steam. You are a bitter sweet companion."
This is a really great game that I love so much!!!!!
Epic revamp new teams with the expansion and plays very smooth worth the $20 
Anything can happen in this game!
"The same old instant classic game, except the graphics are better, the AI is better, population cap is increased, and now with the use of Steam workshop, it makes modifying elements of the game so much easier. What's not to love?"
AoE is a classical game for strategy game players...Buy it if you want enjoy....
I am still having issues with my save games upon downloading The Forgotten DLC ... any way to fix this my game freezes up after loading the saved game in The Forgotten gameplay
10/10
Used to play this game a lot when I was younger. Really amazing game and a hell of a lot of fun to play.
great game when it first came out and now even better with 'HD' textures and steam workshop. If you like RTS this is a must try.
"One of the best games ever. Microsoft, you have my respect!"
"In 1998, I was in sixth grade, and my father brought home a new computer. With Windows 98, the newest version of Microsoft Office, and even Encarta, it was a bright and glorious future. Day after day, I came home, exploring every possible thing I could do with it. We wouldn't have internet access until the next year, so every possible thing was, in fact, somewhat limited. One day, searching through the folders of the Windows install CD (because what else do you do without internet?), I discovered a folder full of games. To be specific, trial versions of games. One of them was Age of Empires.  I was an immediate fan, playing the demo endlessly for (what I remember as) months while I tried to scrape together enough money to buy the full game. All my friends at the time were tranfixed by Starcraft, but I managed to talk a few of them into buying AoE as well, and we went through the confusing process of playing over direct dialup modem connection. I always kept the foldout tech tree near the computer, for easy reference. One day, my cousin saw it during a visit, and I found out that he too was a fan.. He was the one who, during his next visit, told me about Age of Empires 2.   The first game had simply clicked with me. The art style was simple and pleasent, and still doesn't look too bad these days. But by comparison Age of Kings was absolutely beautiful. There was detail - so much detail for the time, and so many little things that made the familiar game mechanics so much smoother. The first time I saw the rain of arrows coming down from a castle I think I laughed in the gleeful sort of way the only a preteen can. Age of Kings quickly became my favorite game of all time.  What I always loved most about either game were the custom campaigns. The superstars of scenario design made things with the campaign editor that can truly be called art. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, take a look at some of the downloads at  Age of Kings Heaven.  [aok.heavengames.com]  I recommend Ingo Van Thiel and Mark Stoker to name a few, but check out any of the top rated, it will be worth it. Since I was never actually very good at competitive online play, I spent most of my time on these elaborate single-player experiences,   Eventually I stopped waking up early to play before school. I played some other games, some by Ensemble Studios, many not. I discovered girls, and later alcohol, both of which occupied much of my time. I have never been far from this game, though.  So now we get to the HD not-quite-so-remake. Being not-quite-so because only a few things are actually change, making it more of a rerelease than a remake. Since Ensemble Studios, the group of masters who made the Age series, were inexplicably dissolved by Microsoft in 2008, its very possible to view this as just milking some intellectual property for every last dollar, with no profit to the developers. And honestly, most of the new things introduced here have been available for some time for the original game. HD means it supports high-resolution, which is also offered by the  UserPatch  [userpatch.aiscripters.net] , and the Forgotten Expansion is a polished version of the  Forgotten Empires mod.  [www.forgottenempires.net]   What is really new then? There's the rendered, water. It does look pretty, though I feel like it might clash a bit with the overall art style. For me it caused lag, so I turned it off. There are other graphical changes as well. Interface icons are different - I'm not sure why they took the time to make them, as there seems to be no advantage or improvement. I'm neutral on this one. A lot of noise has been made online about new farms, but for me, the farms are exactly the same as ever. Perhaps they patched it? If they did, I wonder why they would have bothered to change the farms, but leave the cliffs. Yes, the cliffs in AoE2HD are absolutely horrible, weird gray smudged things that completely contrast with the landscape around them. Luckily, its easy to fix via steam workshop, but the real question I have is why? Why in the world would they go through the effort of adding something that just doesn't look right? Why not just leave it alone, less work for them!  This seems like a lot of evidence stacked against AoE2HD, so it may surprise you to find out that I think its still worth the buy. What it really comes down to is convenience. Getting the original game running on Windows 7 or 8 (or Linux, like I use) requires some steps, but AoE2HD downloads and runs without a problem (not native on Linux, granted, but that comes with the territory). There all those fun steam features to go along as well - achievements (so superficial, and yet so motivating), cards and badges, and easy multiplayer. The Steam Workshop seems like a perfect match, yet I haven't been all too impressed with the content there, compared with AoK Heaven. AoKH has had a few more years to build its collection though, so maybe I just need to give steam some time.  So in all, even though AoE2HD doesn't bring all the much new to the table, changing up my favorite game of all time would probably not sit well either. Therefore I do recommend that this be bought, but maybe buy it when its on sale.  This review has also been posted  here.  [dfarnand.wordpress.com] "
"One of the best strategy games ever made, but you prohably know that."
Wololo
destroyed a giant castle with arrows mongolsOP/10
If you played this in the 90's your going to love it today. Playing and connecting is easy. Drops multiplayer rarely.
they based the AI off of kids from camp CAMP
This game is not HD at all. Well the textures the community offer are HD but the menu's are just stretched to 1080p. Overall great game to play.
I beat an old man to death with an axe 10/10 would play again
'how do you turn this on' -&gt; ctrl+A -&gt; ctrl+C -&gt; (ctrl+v -&gt; enter) x999999999999
This game is way too addicting even playing against the AI system is entertaining.
Very epic
"Graphics are always at the forefront of PC gaming in the present time we are in. I will offer this one bit of advice: if you can play for 6 hours straight at a minimum and feel like only 1 has passed you will be aware the graphics in this game are not an issue. A classic game, which anyone can play."
Remake at its best. Loving it.
"If you like real time strategy, you can't have missed this game. If you like medieval stuff, you can't have missed this game.  Even after all these years, this game is still fantastic. I think no other real time strategy game has achieved what AOE2 has.  The graphic is still fine, the mechanics are ok, the fatcions diversity is there and the game overall is kinda balanced.  Also the AI has enough difficulty levels to be challenging for almost everyone.    The votes  Graphic: 7/10 today, 9.5/10 when it came out Campaings: 8/10 today, 9.5/10 when it came out Civilizations: 8/10 today, 9.5/10 when it came out Mechanics: 7.5/10 today, 10/10 when it came out AI: 10/10 Longevity: 10/10, still enjoyable after 14 years. Expansions: The Conquerors 10/10, The Forgotten 6/10  Overall: 8/10 today, 15/10 in 2001"
"I've had a few copies of AOE2 + Conquerers over the years. The CD's have often got destroyed and new ones bought again. I used to play this game for hours. The Steam version of the game has fixed a few things that were broken originally. All of the network play used to be a nightmare to get going. This is fixed now and integrated to work with your friends list. The Steam workshop lets you customize the look of the game by downloading small mods, maps, music packs etc. The game resolution has been upped majorly and looks less pixelated then it is in the original by alot.  The only drawback for me with this game is the LAN feature. This is non existant and often I would play AOE in LANS. Despite the game being fantastic and made shinier not having the LAN feature blemishes things a bit. Currently if I wish to play with my siblings in the next room, it's played through the Steam network and not locally. Which means we can lag despite the short distance betwen us.  If you enjoyed the original. This game is exactly the same, shinier, would recommend it to vets looking for a digital copy.  Just don't expect any LAN play."
"It's a good game, a classic. BUT, in my heart, Age of Mythology will forever be better. Anyone with me? Anyone? :P"
A classic game with great campaigns.
"Great game. The updated HD graphics really modernize this game, yet it keeps the same feel that it had when I played it as a kid. 10/10 Would build Longbow men again."
"I'd strongly recommend to play this game, it's a classic of my times!"
"The Age of Empires Series is like the Grand Series of all RTS games.   The economy/military aspect is very much important in this game. Fails your economy, your military units will be smashed into pieces and the other way around.  The best balance must be found... and then my friend... you will be the true ruler of all Empires!  So... what are you waiting for? Get Age of Empires 2 HD where you can be the ruler of 18 civilisations, in 9 campaigns with 57 scenarios and a great Multiplayer action!"
"Strongly recommend AOE2 HD to anyone who has ever liked RTS style games. The upgrades made to AOE2HD make this game worth the purchase, even if you already own AOE2... Things like full screen and steam integration for multiplayer make life a breeze. If you don't own this, get it!"
"Look, It's Age of Empires II. Enough info."
"NOSTALGIA !! Loved it as a child, loved it as a teen, and still loving it. A few good games don't need to be 'upgraded' with a ♥♥♥♥♥on of DLC's, new engine remakes. Some games are just good old fashioned good.   This being a wonderful example."
"Really amazing game to play by yourself, or with friends. The fact that I can keep coming back to this game and enjoy it is just awesome, not many games can do that. Since I have owned this game since something like 2007, I will say and continue to say that I love it."
"Absolute classic, get it and give me a game!"
"Really awesome classic game, if you ever played Age of Empires in your childhood you love this!"
Quite difficult but enjoyable. AI cheats which makes it very interesting.
"Can't say enough about this game.   One of my very first experiences with PC gaming, AoEII was an awe-inspiring idea and execution.  I would spend hours building my civilization from dirt into a powerhouse that could defend its walls in real time, whilst trampling over enemy troops halfway across the map at the same time.   I'm not sure if there was a bigger rush in gaming than amassing a large army to make a final assault on the enemy's castle to claim victory, putting all of your hard work to the ultimate test.  -----  -The graphics, although aged, are still surprisingly pleasant to look at 14 years later.  -This game's focus on history, (no lie), made me into a history buffat age nine; campaigns like Joan of Arc &amp; William Wallace are memorable &amp; fun. -There are multiple strategies to defeating your enemies; will you take the total war approach and heave massive forces at your opponent until they can't fight back, or cut off their resources and bleed them dry, striking at them with skirmishes?  The addition of the Steam Workshop can add HOURS of content  -----  All in all, this is one of my favorite games ever. I will admit, I was nervous about nostalgia clouding my judgement; but it hasn't. Not in the least bit.   Instant buy."
crazy fun skirmishes and campaign. plus information about ancient civilizations
"This isn't just wololo, this is wololo... IN HIGH DEFINITION !"
"I used to play this game as a kid, I picked it up during the summer sale. I'm so happy to be playing this again. AOE is a classic RTS. Get it."
Brings back good memories and still as awesome as ever. I wish they didn't change all the hotkeys though..
"Previously played this game to death and absolutely loved it.  The HD version doesn't really provide anything more than the original did and is ultimatley a cash in on a great game with some minor graphic improvements.  Having said that, if you dont have a copy of the original i would certainly recommend this game although i would be inclined to buy it in a sale!  As with a lot of older games the AI can be suspect at time and downright stupid at others and, with all these style games, the harder difficulties dont mean the AI is better tactically it simply gathers resources and builds faster than it is possible for a player to do!  All in all this is a classic well worth some time."
great game but bad dlc
"Well, you could just pirate the old version... The only advantage to this version is the actual official servers."
"Pros - Behold the Modern RTS Masterpiece. Go for it. Economy, Warfare, They have EVERYTHING you expect.  Cons - Y U NO AOE I HD?!  9/10, Strongly recommended(if only they give us AOE I HD)"
"a classic and a favourite, hd version and forgotten expansion make it better"
Nostalgia! This game needs no introduction and you need one then ur probably a freshly laid egg that just looked at RTS for the first time.. and if so well done you picked a classic for ur first go The game works fine on Windows 7 i've had no issues with this game and thanks to Steam playing with my friend from different parts of the world is a breeze. They have not changed anything its still the same game. If you want somthing with more social/online feel I would recommend AoE Online which is a free to play vesion of this title with updated graphic and quite alot of multiplayer achivment and goals... but if you just wanna play the classic then this beauty is laying here waiting for you to say yes!
I've only cared for the multiplayer. It's fine. It's fast. It's challenging. It's micromanaging at a good level.
For such an old game is still tremendous fun. Would highly recommend to any old school RTS players or anyone in general who likes the genre.
I loved this game when it was first release 1000 years ago and now it has been remastered (except the opening video) and works once again. So Happy.
"I would recommend this game period to anyone who has never played the original game and likes real time strategy but for those who have played and own the game and was hoping for a rehashed, fixed up verion then your hopes will soon be dashed. This game falls flat in what its supposed to deliver. Not much at all has been changed that is noticable. The whole 3d water effects kinda fade after time and what your are left with is the same unbalanced game(thats to be expected), poor pathfinding, and terrible matchmaking that seems worse than it was before. Seriously they have one lobby for everything and a filter to the right to help find the right game. Why they could not have better organized the multiplayer lobby like they did in MS Zone is beyond me. The game still suffers from the debilitation slow downs that plagued the game years ago. I would like to think that with todays modern gaming machines and higher bandwidth connections the game would have a smoother multiplayer match even with 8 players at a time. Instead you have the same old problems of disconnections, late game slowdowns. waiting for people to respond, and something I never saw on zone which is unsyncing. I have not tried the newest expansion yet but from what I have seen so far, I would not recommend this game for full price."
"Quick and to the point.  It's just like its original in ingame features, one of the best RTS games out there in this style, in my opinion, second to Rise of Nations.  The only problem is performance - despite the HD, there's nothing actually changed with the graphics, only resolution compatibility. Even on my system, it runs worse than I remembered playing on my old computer which is more-or-less out of date by ten years. On my old computer, I'd create maps with thousands of units and place them at war, but now on singleplayer with my new computer, it begins lagging to 2-6 fps within 2-3 hours into a match. It's unplayable when I try to have large scale matches, I can't bare it. Multiplayer can be even worse with frequent crashing.  The only reason I am recommending this game is because the game itself is amazing. If you're going to buy this, be wary of the performance issues - they're sometimes completely rediculous. Hopefully in a few months or so (Since it's been a year in which they haven't fixed it) they'll release a patch that'll eliminate the perfomance issues."
Good game. Not really worth the 'HD' upgrade.
"My father introduced this game to me when I was 12 years old. Since I joined the Service, I've introduced this game to my roommates, now I hold responsiblity for their addiction. I've played this game more than a couple hundred hours, this game is brilliant compared to other RTS games including AOEIII which is total dog crap. I still also have the original CD of Age of Empires I. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fast pace war games."
One of the Best and first (played back in early 2000s) RTS games I have ever played.
"Loved this game back in the day, used to play Michi DM all the time. Still an awesome game that stands the test of time."
The new AI is much better than the old one.
"Classic revamp - worth it when discounted, - otherwise boot up the old version and download forgotten Empires the unofficial pack, has higher resolution support and better AI"
Nothing better than crashing the party with a few hundred Shelby Corvettes! Brings back so many memories!
"Good old times, awesome game!"
"One of my favourite games of my childhood, decided to play it again to pass some time and it's still as addictive now as it was then"
Loved playing it as a kid so when it was re-released in HD I jumped immediately in. Now in the Steam Summer Sale it's totally worth it's price and i have had hours of fun replaying it online.
Still a great game that also educates in history pretty good. This remake also works on modern operating systems (like WIndows 8) without any issues. Definitely worth it while on sale.
Heart.
Good hd version of my old favourite game from years ago...
Still one of the best games ever made!
"The game itself I played initially upon release and loved it just like all of the Age series (AOE3 my least favorite though). I got the HD rerelease here on steam and dove in and loved it just as much if not more due to the improved graphics. Great game and I actually think I like it a little more than AoM sometimes which is my favorite Age game.  I'd love to see another expansion pack or HD remake though, one that covers Rome Greece Egypt and Mesopotamian cultures. Vanilla Age of Empires as a HD edition would be cool."
"Solid remaster. Good for nostalgia, stands the test of time decently, runs well. The biggest flaws are the AI and the pathing. Unit behavior can be very frustrating to control. The computers always cheat."
"12 years, still play weekly."
 The same Age of Empires that you remember from your youth
"Has been one of my favorite games since i was a child, a very solid rts."
10/10 best game since 2010
"Owners should consider making some ''get the game free'' promotions to convince more players to join this community. It would be a good move for us, the players and I bet it would be a good marketing scheme as well."
"I used to play this game when I was a kid. I loved it. And playing it now, I realize I still love this game. Though the graphics aren't high tech or anything, it is an awesome strategy game. It runs great on my computer.  If you arent into strategy or time consumption, this probably isnt for you, since each game runs for around an hour. (Depending on how good you are at the game.)  But if you are, then I suggest you download it right now!!! Great game  Overall: 8.5/10"
"Fun like the original, just updated graphicsy everything you could wish for an AoE game. Sadly the multiplayer is a mess, it's impossible to play online, huge delay, disconnects and random crashes. But if you can get it for a cheap price it's still worth it."
It has a romantic athmosphere for old computes games..
don't you just need to remember all the nostalgic feelings that comes with this game?
"Oldschool classic, take everything you remember and add some slightly better graphics then kick your steam mates ♥♥♥!!"
"Start the game already.. Wololoooo!  The upgrades in the HD version are fun, I was playing this game way too long without them!!"
Monk i need a monk
"The hours shown above do not reflect the true amount of time I have spent playing this game (because I have spent much more playing it as a kid). AoE SPILLS nostalgia from my childhood and brings it all back in HD!! Needless to say this is my all-time favorite RTS. With the new upgraded graphics and additional civilizations, it's just too much fun. If you're into building massive armies or micromanaging individual units to pester your enemies, building great walls to defend/claim your area, or battling at sea (optional), THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!! #multiplayer"
Just have to love it.
For me this game is so fun i have been play it for as long as i can remeber it has always been on my pc. I dont know what it is i have always played this game.
fresh feel to an old classic
"A relaxing, fast-paced RTS. Will you be the Vikings, the Chinese, the Goths, or one of many other ancient societies in order to become the dominant faction?"
Its better than sex.
Good game. Expect from Herofest. Abit ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Oh well....
"Great game, same old Age of Empires II."
Been playing this game since it first released 14 years ago. best RTS game ever made. go buy it now!!!
One of the best games in history!
"Awesome game, brings back childhood memory's :)"
"The best old-war game, and a great way to know more about history."
"Yep, I love this game! There are so many tactics to try and it's the kind of game you need to practice at in order to hone your skills (which I do not have haha).  Only thing I don't like is that the computer can be pretty predictable but.... the online aspect is really fun and challenging! "
"New Graphics, old Game, still worth playing :)"
"This game is awesome, so much of my human existance has been lost into this 'wonder' of a game ;)  DOWNLOAD IT     NOW!!"
A very good classic.
Never play death match vs 6 AI. Ever.
"This game is a major nostelgia trip for anyone over 15 and for major RTS players. This game is 100% grade A stratergy gold. Idea behind the game is simple. Gather resources, research technoglogies, build structures and make a huge army to wipe your rivals from history. A simple concept but so hard to do so sometimes. Games can last mintues or hours but are always entertaining. 9.5/10."
"If i had to sum up my childhood with a title then that Title would be Age of Empires, when i was 9 years old i bought AOE II and couldnt wait to get home and play it. sadly my computer lacked the required components to play it and so my mate played it while i watched. when i finally got a good enough computer to play it i spent countless hours playing it and if steam had been around at the time and if i'd bought it there my total hours would now probably be around 5600 because this game is MEGA AWESOME and the new DLC is friggun amazing. i haven't been this happy since i was that small wonder filled 9 year old boy  /Bobo out :)"
Unbelievable game. Bringing back the classic to a new generation!
looks and plays great
This game is very addicting and well made. It is fun and very stratigic... need I say more? RAIDING PARTY!
great memories now improved by HD
Same old great experience. Really tightly balanced.
"Missed it the first time round, fantastic game hours and hours of playability, nothing better than taking on your mates on a small map with a crazy population allowance. A must have for any RTS gamers."
"I hate this game so much, it's so bad... *wololololol* Best game ever, can't beat it, 10/10, ultimate game of all time! if this game was a woman, i'd marry her. if this game was a guy, i'd marry him."
I love this game and always will. 
Age Of Empires II: The Horse Dung Edition dont buy this seriously its muck!
"Great Game, alone or with friends"
"I played this game, when I was younger. I absolutely loved it. I got it on Steam to relive the moments. I just haven't been able to relieve the moments yet. If you're a person who had the original game. You're probably not going to want/buy this game considering that you've already paid for it, ages ago. The CD keys aren't redeemable on steam, it's going for US$ 20.00 it's a bad Price considering it was made in 1999.   If I enhanced the game, I would of put the price as $10.00, but that's just my opinion though. but believe me it is a great game, it was hailed as one of the best strategy games of it's day. If you're gaming taste is medieval/RTS it's right down your alley way. It also does have a map editor in the game. Which is great it's better than having to close down the game and open a separate program  I would probably have to rate it, 7/10 Garmes"
This game has some good memories...
Absolutly love this game. Have played for over a decade and can never get enough. Its just one of those games that grow on ya and always have a place in your heart.
Great game! Looking forward for the new expansions!
you know what this is and you know it's great
"It's very hard for me to recommend the game. This isn't because it's bad, but because it's nothing new. They like to brag about the updated and modern graphics/textures, but those screenshots were taken zoomed very far out. Even the old version would look good zoomed out. The AI is the same, attack move wasn't updated to be like modern RTS, and everything else is flat out the same. If I were to recommend it, I would only do so because it's 'updated' to work on modern OS's and there is renewed multiplayer. I have to say it is only worth it on sale, and will not be worth full price based on the little 'improvements' it has been given.  EDIT: I'm going to come back and change this recommendation for the sake of giving credit where it is due. I've got almost 40 hours into this bad boy and still no crashes/glitches/problems. I'll also mention that this game comes with an expansion on top of a new campaign already different from the original game. That said, there is even a new expansion coming out (African Kingdoms). This game is gettnig the treatment that I wish Age of Mythology was getting, but I cannot in my mind not recommend a game that's supported so much. It's not even expensive.  P.S. We still have the crappy attack moves. They're useless."
"Anyone who plays this game will love it, period. It can be played thorugh using strategy and cunning as well as brute force, which is why it's so fun. You can use so many different methods and strategies to play it is mind blowing how addictive it becomes."
"You'll play this game properly at first. It's a lot of fun like that, despite the outdated graphics (HD? Pfft), and glitchy gameplay. Then you'll find cheats, and invest four thousand hours into this game. Four thousand might be an exaggeration. Like two thousand. Minimum (ignore my 50+ hours it's actually two thousand). This game is a great classic and my favorite in the series. I seriously recommend you buy it."
This game is a classic and will always be one of my favorites
"Classic, never goes out of style. It's always fun. Pick up a copy a huge discount and play multiplayer with me!"
My favorite multiplayer game
"I love this game, I used to play this while deployed in Kuwait. Got it again via the HumbleBundle 2 deal for only 15 bucks along with a bunch of other games. Highly Recommended if you're into RTS games"
Lots of fun.
Neat
As i was just starting to build my town i scout ahead to see what my enemy was doing only to find out that they were sending an army to attack me  10/10 would lose again
If you like Mid aged weapon pom youll love this game.
"Must have for all who played the original, finally it looks nice on a HD-monitor. The smooth steam integration let's you set up matches easily. It just feels like old times and the addiction takes over again ;)"
"Not only did they improve the graphic quallity and the controlability, they fixed a large amount of bugs which made this game too challenging for me to play, there's one major bug which could (if it hasn't already) become a problem, in which the idle worker hotkey/button doesn't function. (If anyone has a solution, I'd love to hear it.)"
Glory of the old days.
Great classic game that will never get old!
"If you are a fan of the original AoE2. You should definitely get this game! The updated graphics and widescreen support are much welcomed, plus the graphics keep the original nostaligic feel, while at the same time update it to this HD era.  Plus the MP works like a charm!"
This is an amazing game! -amazing water -better graphics -amazing expansion packs -new fire the water looks like it is from age of empires 3! the new expansion packs are awseome too! this game is great I recommend it to any person whos into RTS's 
even the lags and multiplayer issues are like the old good times. 10/10 for the nostalgia
For my calculations i nedd to play until 2070 to finish all the achivements. Boring achivements made for this game
First game i ever played and loved. I do think that its 100% more awesome to have the boxed copy but steam offers better multiplayer.  The workshop has over 1000 FREE DLCs so if you have the game you most take a look there.  Best of all no U-play
An awesome classic :) Must have
You won't need another game.
"A true classic. I've been playing AoE for about 10 years, and just recently got it on Steam. I've got to say, the new HD-ness is extremely awesome. Also, it plays the music from both AoE II and the expansion, and it loops. Which isn't a huge deal, but after about 30 minutes of playing on the disk version, the music just stops. If you like RTS games, buyyyyyy itttttttt."
LOVE this game
"Heaps of fun to play with the lads, we wear out the horses though, seeing as they generate all the power"
This game has been a lifetime favorite of mine. HD made it even better and the forgoten DLC is a fun little edition. Very fun to play with friends and with a little imagination immerssive. Bottom line I love this game. &lt;3
Great game should get exspecially Jakynator!!
The graphics update should have been more extensive. The HD edition is for a small screen and a low resolution monitor. Not a very good effort given the quality of the material they had to work with.
best game ever try to downloade resorece packs the game well be better
9/10 great remake of the original
"This, the Age of Empires II Extended aditon is probably my favorite of the Age of Empires games. It stretches from the time of the Middle ages through to the Spanish Conquistidores, and has some great campangs. I have many great memories of playing the CD version of this game and seeing it here on steam made it a must have."
"one of the best games Ive played on PC been playing this game from time to time over the years. its totaly worth your time if you like building towns and castles and fighting armies. I still remember most of the cheats by mind type these in in your chat bar be warned you will not get acheivements on games you use these on. cheese steak jimmy's (meat) lumberjack (wood) robin hood (gold) Rock on (stone) those are just some of the cheats you can use find the rest online also Simply copy and paste any cheat (using CTRL + C and CTRL + V, respectively) as many times as you desire. best to play the campagne with out cheats to to fully enjoy yourself. also theres an awesome forge mode where you can make your own map. still plenty of people playing online together at the time of writing this. try putting hundreds of solders for fun on a plank map and see what happens. my old compage pc could handle hundreds on screen so you should not have to worry about game freezes with this game."
If you like the age of empires series or just stratigy games. then you will like this game. but i have to say they maybe can do better with the multiplayer lag
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with a HD remake filled to the brim with content. With the Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price."
"Ah, Age of Empires II, I started playing the game in 2004. I've played it on and off Since that time, and I still love this game. A classic RTS Game with an occasionally unfair balance between civilizations and plenty of upgrades and strategies to take advantage of. If you like medieval strategy games you have to own this game, or if you like RTS games in general I bet you'll enjoy it too. The game never gets old for me and I recently intorduced it to my friends, and now most of the time they wanna play some multiplayer. Even if you've never played a strategy game before, I highly recommend this to be your first, It was mine, and it's my favorite. In my opinion it's the best RTS game ever made, except for AOE 3 of course."
"START THE GAME ALREADY!  By far the high water mark of all the 'Age' games, AOE2 is still as good to pick up and play 15 years on as it was all those years ago. Whether you're fighting a human opponent or you just want to waste some time sacking computer kingdoms, every RTS fan needs this in their library."
"My inner child screams every time I play this game because this is one of my very first childhood games.  If you're now an adult and played this as a child, then you absolutely have to buy it and relive those times again. You won't be disappointed.   A game that you still feel like playing 16 years after it was released pretty much says it all."
one of the classics you just have to comeing back to it
"Pure Classic, got this for free with Windows 2000 back in the day. Still holds up today."
I really love the old version of this game but this new update is awesome too! I also got the new Forgotten extension.
"IF YOU DON'T BUY AND PLAY THIS, YOU A SCRUB"
"Great game.  I never played the AoE franchise before I got this redux. I got the game to play with a friend whom I normally play Halo Wars with. I didn't pick this up thinking I would have a similar experience as HW (which is more arcade-y, with the focus on battle and less on resource gathering), but he was a big fan of AoE2 back in the day so I thought I'd give it a go with him.  I can't compare it to the Ensemble original, but I will say this: Even in 2013, the game can easily make you look past its aging graphics and experience a bottomless pit of fun and diverse battles. The civiliations you can play as all have their own unique traits, so you can easily take the same match settings and turn it into something entirely different by just selecting a different Civ.  Believe me, it's a great use of 19.99$ if you're into RTS games."
Classic RTS.
"It's a great classic RTS with updated graphics. I would strongly recommend buying it, but don't expect that many changes from the original. The main changes are graphical ones apart from a few minor fixes."
"Everything you love about the 1999 classic, now even better. With support for hi res monitors and modding through steam workshop, the game feels brand new."
The holy mother of RTS. Is still a standard and unbeaten in game balance!
The game's 15 years old... I still treat it like its a brand new coppy of Black Ops 2.
Love this game for ever! 
"Used to play this game all the time when I was younger and it hasn't lost it's addictive quality, nice to play online with people too. Not gonna lie although I have loads of awesome games on here this will still probably be the one that get's the most hours."
Classic. Must buy game.
I played this game for 10 years. I grew up with it. I'm still playing.  
"fun oldschool RTS that comes a lot closer to making you manually gather your resources than other games would dare go. makes for a fun change of pace, however."
♥♥♥♥ing old game is still the bomb ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥
Scouting with sheep. Baa. :AOESheep:
Best Game ever played!
Wololo that ♥♥♥♥ until you win.  10/10.
It's a classic. And the expansion just makes it even better. Great game!!! Keep up the goodwork.
Great RTS game placed in the middle ages. Though lack of adjustment for video quality may cause complications.
"Don't get me wrong, the game is very good. However the optimalization is very bad and there isn't much people playing. It's better to just find your old copy and play online on voobly with unofficial hd community patch (google it). Tons of players, very competetive with elo system.  Anyway, if you already have the game, don't buy it, it's waste of money."
"a quick review.  notable cons: it's not a game designed for progression which in my case is a letdown as i feel the need to constantly get stronger, richer and so forth. it's very time consuming because every game takes 1 hour minimum while it can taken multiple hours in other cases. pro: can't really say i have something in specific to say, everything about the game is just fantastic and i would deffinitly recommand it. it's old but yet fun to play either solo or with friends.  overall i would say it's well worth the cost, even without a discount, with a discount on steam or buying from a site designed from it you could get countless hours of possibility and gameplay for a minimum cost.  i shouldn't forget to mention there are a few expansions aswell but the game is playable without as it allready provides enough content by itself and in my opinion the expansions are only for thos who truelly love the game and have played it and feel it's time for an 'expansion' haha, you see what i did there? oh nevermind me... have fun!"
A lot of bugs. Didn't work in Windows 7 under Virtualbox. All fonts (texts) in the game were missing. I am not the only one with this issue. Also didn't work under Wine in Linux - multiplayer game didn't start. I requested a refund.
one of the best games i have ever played besides age of empires 3
"This is a great and important warning! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WILL WANT TO START A MULTIPLAYER GAME AND NOT FINISH IT AND THEN SAVE IT!  The devs, apparently did not fix this bug, and if you want to restore a saved game the game or lobby if you will, goes out of sync. Although I don't say things like this, this is the first time, and I hope it's the last, when I say: It's better to not buy it and play it the pirate way. At least that version can load saved games.  DISCLAMER: This is my oppinion, and maybe, just maybe, I will change my oppinion.   That is what Microsoft is doing to games, and like Pappa Franku used to say.... IT'S TIME TO STOP!!!  P.S: If you like strategy like games, this is a jewel, and it DESERVES to be played. It's an old diamond and I am truly sad that it ended up like this. I am not recommending this game to be bought. I am recommending this game to be played? How? Well, you know very well how."
"One of my Favorite Old-School Games I used to play as a Kid.  Graphics are enhanced a lot but still you shouldnt consider this game to have 'real HD' which in my opinion doesn´t matter though.  What´s kinda dissappointing is that, despite high end Hardware, the game is kinda laggy when it comes to scrolling.   Nevertheless an absolutely awesome &amp; great Game which is totally deserves to be played once again :D"
Where do I begin with this game. I have been playing Age of Empires since I was about 5 and have been in love with it since. Every Game you play brings something new and has never felt repetetive. The Campaigns are historically acurate and will keep you entertained for hours as there are many aporoaches you can tak to them overall I give this game a 10/10 it is worth your money.
"Simple, but clever game mechanics and great gameplay - combination resulting in a game that still surpasses most of the games in its genre."
I love this game i played this 5 years ago. But on this version on steam is lags on multiplayer.. BIG BIG BIG LAGS.. You must play with someone who have really good ping but 95% of all players have 100+ ping..
Brings me back to my younger days. Awesome!!!
"if you either love RTS games or want to get in to RTS games, this is the perfect game to get. The only things that really suck are framerate drops and no mod menu to enable or disable mods."
"Do you like conquering your enemies? Do you like to win by setting fire to towns with nothing but pure steel and limitless patience? If you fit the following catagories, Age of Empires is just for you. Relive your childhood with this new HD remastered edition, so that you can rage even harder at the Byzantines for their tech rushes, the goths because of their unending infantry line, and stuggle to kill a teutonic knight with 30 war elephants. BUY THIS GAME!!!!"
I wasted a good portions of my youth on this game and i loved every minute of it i played the first Age of empires this is what got me hooked on stategy building games. I love this game so much. i tryed to play the orignal game on a pc and it ws just to out dated im so happy they upgraded it so you can play it on a modern day pc i have to give this game 10/10 just because it brings back memorys and is such a good game
"One of the top 5 games on my playlist. It is really really fun, I Suggest that you should get it! It requires strategy, As well as some other stuff. Love playing this game and it is really fun with other people."
Excellent RTS game with many options. loved it since the 90's  9/10
Love the game. glad they re did it in HD
if you like the AoE II then your going to love the remastered HD version... Does not disapoint at all.
"Not the best RTS ever made, but it's the one I've sunk the most hours into and just plain fun."
Amazing game. I loved the original and have been playing this since i was like 3 and 11 years later still one of my favourite games ever. 9 out of 10.
"This game is a lot like Civ, except it does not have turns and the treacherous Ghandhi. 10/10 would play again."
"IF YOU BUY A GIFT, YOU CAN NOT GIVE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS REGION RESTRICTED BE CAREFUL! "
Loved it.
VElly goot one
"I love the game, it was part of my childwood and now steam make the game reborn! I realy recomend the game to the ones that like strategy games and massive wars"
this game is still the ♥♥♥♥ bich
I highly recommend this game to others.
"Amazing Game, Learn how to play , and you will have a great time in Singleplayer Or Multiplayer, :) Worth The Price"
"Awesome game! I've been playing this game since I was 4 or 5 years old, and to this day I still love it."
"One of the best RTS ever made with lots of gameplay improvements!  Larger pop cap, bigger maps, better AI and pathfinding and much more. Age of Empires II HD Edition it's totally worth it - doesn't matter if you are an veteran or new player. For the ones who played the original back in 1999, like me, the Forgotten Expansion is a wonderful thing. It adds a lot to the game and will make it fresh again. Also, you can download maps, campaigns and customize visuals and soundtrack with the Steam Workshop, making the game look and feel different.   If you're new to the genre, don't feel intimidated. AoE II HD is a great way to start playing RTS. Beyond the tutorial, there's the campaigns, helpful to teach about units, commands and strategies. You don't need to be aggressive to win - there's diplomatic victory conditions too.  Build your empire in your way and join this epic journey!"
"I SIMPLY LOVE this game. I'we played i for 18years now and never gets boring to me. It's just sad to see that the only thing they have done in this release is to bump op the Ress. Minor fixed edition. it could need a little more. it stil has some major issues. fx. after exploring and poulating most of the map, it gets SUper laggy.  so a save &amp; exit is nessesary. fixes it for some time, then u must do it again.   But it stil is MY fav when it comes to this sort of game."
Age Of Empires II is a classic Strategy game which dont have bugs. You need to have a lot of experience at this to win at online where you may counter old veterans.
This game is the ♥♥♥♥
Love this game!!! Dissapointed though that steam seem's to of taken out the LAN options in multiplayer...... I don't see why i have to be connected to steam to be able to play multiplayer.... I suppose i can just hope for an update......
"Honestly, I love this game with a passion. I could go as far as to say that it increases your IQ and teaches you life lessons, and both would probably be true.  But this game is plagued by a development team that possesses failure in its worst form: 'good intentions'. I am going to try and use the workshop in order to build work arounds for several major problems with the game. Some of the major problems include:  1. The sprites are not actually higher quality. The workshop has some good ones, but this is still unnacceptable on an'HD' port.  2. The multiplayer is atrocious. It should be laid out so that if one player lags out, that player is simply resigned and the game starts anyway. The network code needs to be completely reworked.  3. Out of sync errors need to be fixed.  4. When a player resigns, all of his units just stand idly. This happens constantly when I am in a multiplayer lobby. Other players should be able to get control of the units, or the units should be taken over by a computer player. Many good games have been ruined by this."
still lag but i love this game !^^
this game is a great game that i have been playing since i was little and hasnt lost my interest i love building my own campain using triggers and it isnt an expensive game.  10/10
"Despite the fact it isn't truly HD resmatered, the game is awesome at all. I see lots of potential on its gameplay.  10/10.  CAUTION: ♥♥♥♥in' time consuming."
"If you know me well like actually well and not because I comment on stuff, you would (hopefully) know that I LOVE Age of Empires 2. But why? Why is this one of my favorite games? Hard to explain but I'll try. Aoe2HD is a real-time strategy game. You'll play as GOD HIMSELF or something I don't know. All I know is that you have a bird's perspective of the world. You will start with a few villagers, a town center and Scout cavalry (horse users for combat) to explore. At first the draw-distance maybe remind you of Silent Hill but when you go close to it, it will reveal unexplored terriotory. You might notice some more darken/greyish areas that means you don't have sight of it meaning you have explored it, but you can't see enemy troops or updates on cities. Villager will build things like stables, barracks and castle etc. And they can get resources. YOU NEED THEM! Wood, gold, food and stone are used to build, well buildings and creating soldiers or more villagers. Now you'll need to advance age from the dark age to the other age I don't remember the name. New buildings, troops and upgrades. You'll have to build a army and destroy your foes! Soooo I explained how to play....but not why I love it. First of the story mode is based on real historical events and there is a history book about each playable civilation and other events if intrested. Second of is the custom map creator. OHHH YES! So many options! And then we get to the mods. I don't have to talk about them, self explanatory. I'm sorry I can't tell WHY I love this game, but you have to trust me this is a fantastic game. But be warned some matches can take hours, so play only when you have time or you CAN take breakes. ~PokemonTrainerWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!"
"It's Age of Empires 2, this game was always good... Still better than most current RTS.  Don't expect great visuals or majestic cutscenes, but the game has some of the most solid mechanics of it's genre. Even the HD version looks dated, but at least it fits my widescreen monitor a bit better."
"A Classic, and cornerstone to gameing  For RTS fans this is a must have and no collection is complete with out it"
"The first RTS game I ever played and one of the pioneers of the genre. The gameplay can be a bit slow, very much so if you don't know what you're doing, but it's easy to learn and easy to start having huge battles and sieges.  I give this 9/10 castles + 2 Shelby GTs."
a classic. who doesn't know this game?  go back to your cave dude...  10/10 game 
its pretty fun except when the people you play with only build petards
"Age of Empires is a game that has aged  so  well with time. The game and strategy involved is near perfect. I strongly recommend this game.  As someone who plays this game regularly I am reviewing this in the hopes that devs may see this. Please fix the servers for this game. One person lagging will botch the whole match. This could start from the beginning of the game and cause a rehost. Or, it could start %75 of the way through a 3 hour match and the game isn't even playable. In the past few days, I can say I've disconnected from at least 30-40% of the games I've played. You can imagine my frustration when I may have the upperhand at the time.  To clarify: I STRONGLY recommend this game. I just hope that they can fix the servers for this eventually."
"One of the greatest strategy games ever made.. If you like strategy games, you like Age of Empires II. 9/10"
"I played this a fair amount back when the original game wasn't that old, and have been amazed at its longevity. More recently, I've been watching games with commentary, which led me into playing the game with my spouse.  But this was largely with the old version. However, when there was a sale for the HD version, I couldn't resist getting each of us copies, as well as the expansion pack.  Is it really all that different? No. But that's why this is such a good game; it didn't try to entirely remake the game. It looks good, the AI works better, certain annoyances (like the 200 pop cap) are lessened, etc. It's the same game, but with updates.  Which is exactly what I wanted. If you've played this game before, it's probably exactly what you want, too.  If you haven't, well, there's a reason why so many people play this game despite the age of many of its aspects."
Even after almost two decades it is one of the best Strategy games about. This game was my childhood.
"Its the familiar game we all grew up with, with an increased resolution. I'll always recommend this game simply because it is such a good game. If you're looking for something with a modern gameplay, this game unfortunetely doesn't have it (although that is one of the features I like)."
Played this game since I was a kid. Love some of the changes that have been made like raising the population cap. Thanks guys.
Great startegy game that you have to use you mind to not lose as the ones i go against always do. 7/10 m8 its gr8 sk8 
"Awesome game, my favorite RTS.  Now updated textures/resolutions and plenty of neat things in the workshop!"
Love this game
'How do you turn this on'  9/10
Classic game back again and better than ever. Happy to have better graphics and compatability with Win7.
Buy it. Buy it right now. Why are you still reading this? BUY IT!
"A lot of people complain that the new developers didn't add enough to the game, but who really wants them to?  Age of Empires 2 is only popular today because it was good all on its own 15 years ago when it was made.   The new devs did their job and polished it up just a bit, the graphics look a bit nicer and run on wide screen a lot better, there is an optional 500 pop cap for those of you who want to stress your internet connection as much as possible, and most importantly there are people to play with online. Yes, there was Voobly previously, but that was cumbersome and was only for absolute die hard fans.   This game seems to constantly be on sale, so at the very least you are buying a steam version of the original game for a quarter of the price. So, buy it and stop complaining, you whining twits."
"oh nostalgia... Playing this game growing up my views of this game are hideously bias but you know despite poor balance and bland single player, this game is a lot of fun. Easily worth the £7 or less that it often costs. More than £10, maybe not so much. It's a lot of fun with hours of gameplau though. It's a great game, if a litle flawed. It would be nice to see more content released other than the lacklustre Forgotten Expansion."
"AoE 2 is a must-play for any strategy enthusiasts! You'll have to carefully manage your resources and constantly adapt to your enemy if you hope to achieve victory in this fast-paced game, and every minute feels rewarding. Your decisions will have an impact through the whole game. Definitely worth a try.  Besides, this is probably the most fun way to learn about history."
Still fun to play after all these years
"A game I could spend 15 hours, Really gets addictive Multiplayer or Singleplayer there are so many components to it. Its worth it for the price :D."
Great Classic AOE! It doesnt look a whole lot different in my opinion than the original. May just be my computer.
"Played this game when it first came out, same with Mythology, still has the captivating glow of happiness and excitement that it washed over me when I was young.  Age of Empires II HD  Pros: Almost unlimited enjoyment from tons of map/civ types and incomprehensible number of strategies to defeat your opponents. Simple fun, extremely time consuming and enjoyable. The HD remake looks great, but still keeps the vibe from the original release. 9/10 for it's genre. Probably only beat by Age of Mythology for the fun abilities :)   Cons: Mayans are an OP civ. But seriously there are only a few tiny flaws in this game, one: that it isn't longer. Although you can get thousands of hours of enjoyment from map editor and randomized games. Two: Not everyone has it, you can still easily find multiplayer games but the chances of your friends randomly having it is slim. "
"Very Very Good Game. This game was practically my Childhood. I love it,"
Dis is a good game 10/10
The DLC have Slavs (my ancestors) vodka/10 would recommend
worth it
"Such a sick game, so good to go back in time and jam this. Get it on sale asap!"
"Bought it for the Nostalgia, Highly Recommend..."
AWESOME NOSTALGIA. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S.
"Let's face it: Age of Kings was a terrific game, and this HD update is just as terrific. The missions and AI are a lot harder than I remember, which in my opinion is a great improvement. In my opinion, one of the top 3 RTS computer games of all time."
I feel like I'm playing DLC Quest since I have to pay for DLCs to play default civs.
"Always loved this game. Loads of fun, limitless play."
"last patch/DLC broke the want to play the game. did not purchase African content.  -&gt;CANNOT RESTORE GAMES!!!!!&lt;-  would like to post this on a report so the devs can fix this but forum is unavaible, so will wave off folks that remember the awsome old game it was."
"It's a classic, it's fun, and I enjoy playing with friends."
One of my favorite games of all time.
"Classic game, played as a kid and I've loved it ever since!"
"Love this game, both DLC xpacs have continued the rich tradition the game originally produced at original release all those years ago. The only aspect that make this the absolute best RTS on Steam would be DLC content for the Star Wars Galactic Battle Grounds version of the game!"
"Great fun, easy to pick up."
"In my opinion, best Age of Empires game made. The Third installment, though very graphically pretty, removed a lot of the microtasking I enjoyed about the second one. Nothing changed from the original to HD version except slight graphic improvements, the water looks really good. My only major complaint about this game would be the A.I. and pathing. Fix these two things and the game is near perfect! If Microsoft does decide to continue this franchise, they need to make the game more like the second one and not like the third.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves RTS's."
"While the HD element of the game makes limited difference, the ease of multiplayer games and the availability of Steam Workshop makes this a must-buy for fans of the original games. Classic Age of Empires fun, with the amazing music, even after a decade or more of playing, this game doesn't get old."
"A+ work by Ensemble Studios 15 years ago, and now this brings it back to enjoy the old orirginal game is there with conquerors and the DLC is just as fun as original game keeping true to the aspect. Music, graphics, single player, multiplayer, custom content, community, always people to play with if your like me and love multiplayer. None of this would be without the team of people in Ensemble and i would like to thank all of them for the hard work and dedication into this game. This game has truely proved itself over the test of time and it still is kick ♥♥♥ game to play. &lt;3 Ensemble Studios we miss the games yall would create together"
"Not much to say. This is an eternal classic from the golden age of real time strategy. Great variety and city building. Can be as fast paced as you want it, a very balanced game although there's a lot of civilisations and a lot of them end up being fairly niche. The only issue I have is the variety which is perhaps its greatest strength as a game. It's hard to learn because of this, but once you're used to it you'll love the game play"
"Been a fan since 2005,the new campaigns are awesome!"
"this is good ♥♥♥♥, buy this ♥♥♥♥."
"Forgotten's campaigns are decent, but have no cutscenes or voice acting except a little for the Alaric campaign, so it kind of kills immersion.  Multiplayer is trash, all the LAN/modem/directIP options have been removed and whatever servers you're being forced to use have a 1 second delay on ALL actions minimum. Unacceptable for any RTS game.  The HD aspect is just 1080p widescreen support. No actual updated textures whatsoever.  Honestly the fan made mod called userpatch for The Conquerors did miles more than this. AND IT'S FREE! It offers widescreen support and fixes the netcode without removing features.  They have the gals to charge $20 for this? Base price should be $5 and sale price like $1.  Might be worth buying for $5 or less on a sale, not more than that. Even then not really.  Honestly just buy the original game at your local bargain shop and install the userpatch. It'd be better.  Also.  Is the will of one man enough to forge an empire?"
"A great game. Really fun to play with friends, classic stratagie. Have been playing this game off and on since the eairly 2000's."
This game is awesome yay :3
I have been playing this game since I was a child. It is simply the   best   strategy game out there.
This game creates a feeling as if you were playing monopoly with your friends. It begins with some hate and anger and as the first hour of the game passes nobody is friends anymore. the high impact sexual violence that follows the seccond hour can only be described as 100 horses charging at a wall made of stone and it being set on fire. then the third hour passes and any one who is still in the game is at the brink of suicide but also filled with a jello like substace called determination. fourth hour passes and nobody belives the game is still going. turns out the only victroy option was relics and one of the relics was missing. 11/10 worth killing a friendship over.
Can't stop playing
"Don't get me wrong, the game is very good. However the optimalization is very bad and there isn't much people playing. It's better to just find your old copy and play online on voobly with unofficial hd community patch (google it). Tons of players, very competetive with elo system.  Anyway, if you already have the game, don't buy it, it's waste of money."
best game ever try to downloade resorece packs the game well be better
age of empires 2 hd reduxed review.  pros:  this age old game heh get it? has finally been updated for modern systems.  i believe the graphics were upgraded slightly but its not really a hd version imo.  now supports widescreen.  decent gameplay.  working multiplayer.  cons:  does not include all expansions.  i havnt played it much recently so i couldnt tell you anything else.  would i reccomend this game? only if you dont have the orginal age of empires 2 even then only when its on sale.
I grew up playing this game...and...and I'm still growing and playing this game!!
Best strategy I have ever played and was my first PC game. I would highly recommend this game and the HD makeover is really nice 
"Classic strategy game, build up your forces and steamroll everyone else. Can be quite repetetive, but this is the perfect game for killing time."
I can play this game for days no battle is the same and the cheats which make the game 10 times better.
"One of the greatest games ever made. New HD version seems to work great, had a few issues but they seem to be on top of fixing them. would reccomend this game forever"
Good time classic!
"i downloaded age of empires today, the game goes in but freezes after a few seconds in single aswell as campighn help?"
great game and play well.
"sick game,totally worth it. the thing i like the most is that you get a complete other way of playing it as when you were a child and only cheated usually :D now if you play it you really get to see what sick ideas and tactics are behind the game"
If you buy that game for multiplayer.. think it again.. Personally i can find only 2 servers to play.. Some times not even 1..
"if you play this game you will get the folowing 11,30,14"
this is gud
Love this game
"very good, brings back good memories from the Zone"
You have Steam Account and don't have this game ?..  SHAME ON YOU !..
"amazing game, probably one of (if not the) best rts game i have ever played."
A game that has prevailed in time.all love this game because it has something special!
Who doesn't love this game? Seriously.
Brings back so many memories.
"who doesn't like some old school age of empires, really."
This game reminds me of my childhood. I think everyone should try this game :)
"   All new High Definition Graphics edition is a very huge plus point for this game.    Runs flawlessly on new generation systems.    All original campaigns are intact and with a beautiful HD graphics.    Forgotten Sands DLC adds new campaigns and adds lots of gameplay.    Lots of content on Steam Workshop to enjoy it for a long long time.    Online game-play is piece of cake, easy to setup and join to existing hosters.    Updates come in fast to add or correct the features.    Also cheats work with this edition ;)   A must buy for real time strategy fans. I am really happy that Microsoft made a good decision to revive this game. Hope it will also revive Train Simulator series, existing simulator now are all flawed in some way or other.  This was the very first game i had on my windows 98 PC, from that time i played this a lot. So its a classical super-hit for me. Also i was able to get my hands on original copy of AOE2 on cd and was happy. But as time progressed expansion packs released. I was desperate to have those also. But never had my luck. One of my relative lived in London and i asked him to get me this game. And to my surprise he got me AOE Collectors Edition. And it had a bonus soundtrack of the game. I was like wow. I play this game once in every month.  But to find this on steam with HD edition was outstanding, to my luck the day i registered it was on daily deal sale of 75% off and within no time i purchased it. So dont think just buy and play with your friends."
"A game every strategy lover should own. This enhanced game takes nothign away from the original I grew up on years ago. Hands down the best in the series, including all the off-shoots: Age of Mythology and Galactic Battlegrounds. It is both challenging yet relaxing at the same time, a nice break between all the fast paced shooters and action games being released now and in the future. A great game no matter how you look at it."
Gotta love oldschool coming back support and play online with me god damn it!!
Really good RTS game. 4/5
Classics are the best especially age of empires 2. In my top 5 games. :)
Yololo
"Classic RTS, Nostalgia at it's finest... It's HD!. 10/10!"
The game you loved when you were a kid ... now in HD !!!!
"Still one if not THE best RTS ever made. All available on Steam with even more stuff than the original.  If you have played and loved this before, no doubt you'll love it again!  If you have never played AoE-II before and you like this genre, it's a must try! (Don't even compare this to AoE-III...please)"
"This is one of favourite games ever, it's disapointing that the serves aren't very good."
Rushed enemys with cavalry and won  10/10 would fap again
"First, gather a bunch of friends to play with. Then wait to see who back stabs who first."
"I don't really like RTS games, but Age of Empires II is one of the few exceptions. The thing that immediately drew me to this game was that it takes place in the past. I can wrap my head around what an archer does, but I have no idea what a  Brood Lord  or a  Warp Prism  does. The gameplay is also suprisingly simple and quick to pick up. However, there is a lot to learn and the skill ceiling is set pretty high. Good gameplay and simple mechanics keep me coming back to the game, even if I get destroyed by almost everyone I play against."
"Amazing game, great for friends to play together."
Top 3 games ever made. Fact.
"Old but still GOLD, Best Real Time Strategy and based real history game ever!"
This game bring back so many memories. It still is awesome and as fun to play as it was when it was released.
.
"The game is awesome, but it is so fu*king laggy... And it is not my hardware de problem... I play skyrim at ultra with mod, but i cant play age of empire 2 without lagging like ♥♥♥♥. A fix is needed."
Timeless classic. Recommended for any strategy-lover.
The game Fkin Suks and i kant even kill anyone i only always die forever
loving the game so far not going to love it when my friends completely destroy me on a multiplayer match  10/10??
I can't count just how many hours of my life I've lost to this game. Probably even more than Skyrim!(Yeah I said it!)  
Its a great game to play with friends.:)
Why isn't the first Age of Empires not obtainable in the steam store?!?! That would make playing the franchise even more enjoyable just having all the games with thier expansions!
"Old-school real time strategy updated with some modern flare, it doesn't get any better than this."
"Still as good if not better years later. AoE:II is amazing, finally now in HD and the additional campaigns are awesome. One of the best civilization managing games ever (fun to horde all the sheep in a pen and mock your enemies!)"
"Really Fun to play, great when playing with friends"
"Played so many hours of this as a kid, nostalgia hard everytime I play. Great game to play with friends. A.I. is just as OP/broken as the original, Normal difficulty hits Castle Age in 16 minutes max, great challenge  10/10"
good and HD
Brilliant for nostalgia and for playing it against friends.
"It's a great game, I resmaturization was really well done. However, they should have left the play on LAN option because when we try to play all in one place it becames to lag and forces us to come back to the older one"
One of the best RTS ever.
"Nice to see this brought up to date a little, never been to blown away by the HD remastered games this is no exception still looks better than original. The fact it gets new content is awesome probably one of best Strategy Games of all time. Buy if you loved original AOE franchise wont dissapoint."
"10/10 would relive my childhood again.  Seriously, though, if you haven't played this, you should. This game and it's predecessor re-defined RTS gameplay."
I love this game it's just like it use to be a old classic to play.
great game I've played this for some 5 years and never gotten bored of it  one of those must-have timeless classics I think
IT IS GOOD
Must buy.
Bought this for my dad and he loves it.  (Maybe because he can kill civilian in this game)
Love it.
"The sad truth is that, after nearly 3 years, the current developers of the HD Edition seem incapable of fixing the game's neverending conveyor belt of bugs, glitches and crippling performance issues. The extremely well-received 4.3 patch seemed to finally rectify a lot of these concerns, but now after the release of the latest expansion The African Kingdoms, more or less every problem with the game has made a return in some form, the very worst of all being the downright unacceptable performance issues. Small freezes and hangups occur every few seconds, making the game effectively unplayable.   That said, the original game is an absolute classic, and still the greatest RTS of all time in my opinion. The eclectic mix of exploration, city building and combat is incredibly enjoyable and addictive. It is a great shame that Microsoft has handed over the rights of such a genre-defining masterpiece to a team of developers who are clearly in over their heads.  Avoid the current version at all costs until these problems are corrected, which, if the developers' track record is anything to go by, could take a very long time."
One of The Greatest RTS Ever remasterd to perfect the allready perfect masterpiece
"After being forced onto Steam to learn how to play games by my game-crazy boyfriend, I found that this is the only game I can so far sit and play several hours playing without getting immensly frustrated and turning it off.  Thoroughly enjoyable."
awesome game a great classic
I'm in love with this game. The flowing hills bring me joy as I continue to produce aids cells with my pikman3. That game is great btw.
I learned more about history and civilizations fom this game than every history class I've taken combined
Grew up playin this game with my best friend big daddy is love big daddy is life.
"This is like the best strategy game ever going HD! Not to mention the other improvements like the population limits, etc. Also, seems like they have removed the Easy difficulty so that makes it really difficult."
AoE2 promises a lot of fun to casual players and those who seek a challenge. The community is friendly and there are many opportunitys to start a pvp game on a noob level 9/10
"This is an old game but a goody, fairly cheap to buy and has had loads of changes for the better. I get very addicted to building a village and destroying others for some reason. Its a game that you can stop and save to carry on another day or if your like me, clear out a whole day on your diary to finish whichever campaign you may be on. There are first time p[aying campaigns that teach you along the way how to play. The harder a level is the faster that level goes. Its a game I recommend. Happy Gaming."
I started to play aeo2 since when I was a child. Me and my father was playing this legend for so many hours. It's a truely remarkable game.
"Classic RTS game revamped. Having them add new civilizations, population count and campaigns makes it a lot of fun to play again."
I changed the religion of a house. 10/10 would convert again.
"If you've played this before, buy it right away. They took a nearly perfect strategy game and redid it with Steam support and improved graphics. If that wasn't enough, they're still updating and patching it, and they're even making a new expansion which will feature even better multiplayer support. They are really working to make this a great multiplay experience again, and not just trying to cash in on the success of a great game by updating the graphics and calling it a day."
I remember when I played this game with friends back in 2008 and 2009. This is a fantastic game and I have good memories. Easy 10/10
"For new player this game may be very unintuitive and therefore frustrating. You must actually spend many hours just to learn how play it.. really! Its in fact not even 'game' but 100% interactive movie, even combat is made from animations of fight. Am actually don't believe this sword touch anything in surrounding, you just click different objects to play different animations and that is all 'game' If you are not fan of movie, character and story they you may possibly bounce off from it like ball from wall. Don't expect anything whatsoever like Elder Scrolls, Gothic, Risen etc. it should have own category its that different."
"This game is supprizingly awesome for such an old game. This is a case of : graphics don't matter .. even though it is the HD version it still looks kinda bad but heck with that, the gameplay is awesome.. great fun when having a LAN-party :)  10/10"
"If you like RTS, this game is the SH!T. Castles, towers, boats, fuggin sheep yea"
When will the mod where all workers(villangers) are black??
"since 1997 the first age of empires through out all of age of empires games, age of empires 2 stands out as an awesome game game play, graphics everything perfect. 10/10"
Best of the Age of Empires series.  Never get sick of it
I loved this game growing up and am so happy it was part of this year's summer sale!
If you like Strategy games  This one is a classic  Totally recommended
"What can I say, I've been playing this game for 15 years and it's still awesome. If you like old school RTS games, AoEIIHD is a must."
Amazing! The game is as beautiful as ever. Can run on any computer. Very fun.
Classic game - just a lot better. Five Stars easy.
One of the good old games.
"The game is pretty nice. I hear many voices saying that the price is to high for a game this age, but I think a game like this, with a good online support system, and some new campaigns, makes it all worth it.   I shouldn't buy it when you only play single player though."
"I converted a catapult to my religion. Then I hit a castle with swords, and it caught on fire. My priest picked up a holy relic that was 8 times the size of him, and put it inside a church, and it started to spontaneously produce money.   Awesome military strategy game 9/10 would have been 10/10 but I couldn't get the 'wololo' to work."
"I love the game overall, escpecially since I'm a fan of good RTS games, but you may want to grab a few buddies for this game. AoE II's AI isn't exactly all for the 'Epic Grand Battle' stuff, if you pick Moderate+ difficulty, get ready to be spammed by waves and waves of Petards, which can get very annoying. But their's good ways to counteract the Petard Spam; Mobile Ranged Units. But after the Petards the AI will spam you with Catapults and Archers. Even though I've only played about 17 hours of this game currently, I can easily counteract them, but my friend who is less skilled than me, not so much. He entitles himself a 'Master of RTS'' even though he can't beat me in a game of chess.   Now that the personal stuff is over, let's give you what you came to read. AoE II is a fantastic game, but you can't automatically become a master at it, it requires practice and (A LOT OF) patience. Beware this game will test your wits of RTS to the finest if set on the right difficulty. This game is also better than AoE III IMO. It's because AoE II has nations that technologies can turn the tides of battle even though you may be outnumbered 10-1 (unless the dude your facing Petard spams, remember kids, don't be that dude) but AoE III is basically 'Whoever has more riflemen and siege equipment win' but it's not a bad game. The Campaign of AoE II keeps you occupied too, but beware, if you do the Joan of Arc Campaign, the English have what they were good at in the actual Hundred Years War, Archers/Crossbowmen.  Evaluation  Pros: Entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat hoping you won't be destroyed, active Community, strategic decision making and planning, overall good AI, Okay Campaigns, not so steep learning curve, and accurate locations (sort of)   Cons: AI tends to spam Petards and Etc. if difficulty is Moderate+, Graphics are semi-old (I put this here for those people who complain about graphics), Some idiots in the community (But there's always has to be in every gaming community), Some people head straight for online instead of learning so beware of noobs, Buddies for this game are almost a must, beware of copycats of the AI stated above in PvP matches, and a final one is I suggest do not jump immediately into the game, do the tutorial campaign first."
"Dem childhood memories tho! I played this all the time when I was 6 or 7 and I was terrible at the game (which I still am today). But even though I'm a bad player, I still find the game relaxing and fun to play. 10/10"
Good old Age of Empires II
This is my favorite game of all time. It's even better in HD.
"Absolute classic! Brilliant game, great multiplayer set up with steam."
just how i remember it. fantastic game
"Just one of those classic games you can never truly put down. You always come back to it here and there. What really got me interested in the steam version is being able to install user mods. On the downside, can't change screen resolution in-game options like the old version. Hopefully devls will patch soon."
Good old classic!
"A classic that is loved among RTS fans. If you don't have this game and love RTS's, then get this. It will instantly become a favorite."
5/10 It was all right. Fun flashback in time.
"Great strategy game, can get a little repetitive but still a great way to spend hours on."
"Clearly a great game, I honistly cant think of any down-floors. The game is completely under your control and brilliant multiplayer for you and your friends with many playlists.  Also has a small campaign and single player, would recomend any of my mates who hasnt allready got it to get it. :D"
"Age of empires 2 HD is for me the best RTS I have played, ever. Some might preffer Starcraft over this, but I don't...I have played red alert 1, AOE2 orginale, Warcraft 2 (or was it 1?), Warcraft 3, SC1 - All good games, but this is the best. Played the game for 2 years now regulary since I picked it up again :)  While Warcraft 3 is technically better, its not as fun RTS as this one. Warcraft 3 was alot about other things than pure RTS.  I love it, its on sale often, and I miss people to play online? Get it!"
Brilliant game new AI makes the game insane I mean literally insane with massive armies that literally destroy you. What more can I say.  
"If you liked the original you will love this... if i have an hour or so to kill, this is my go to!"
It's just as much fun as I remember it to be from the old days! Highly recommended!
This game sucks. The AI is just (WOLOLOOOO) the best AI that there ever was. It's incredible. Game is 10/10
"Just as good as I remember! Plus the cheats still work, and everyone loves the monkey head!"
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY GAME IT'S GOOD.
"This was easily one of the greatest games I played. It was entertaining, challenging, and funny all at the same time. It's a must for people to play."
the good classic game i remeber playing before
"My old school and best Strategy game ever made! As everyone knows AoE2 and knows that there's no other game can compete this game, still love this game and wanna play it more, but actually there's a problem... The problem is year 2014, all other games have much better quality witch makes you can't enjoy this game like you was back then! without relizing you will get bored only because of the old quality, but....  Remake! AoE remake with the current generation will be great! Since the game release i haven't play better Strategy game than AoE. Afterall it's nice to add new content to this game and make it live again, still so recommended."
Definitely brings back the late night fun of playing with friends again without the hassel of figuring out IP addresses and port forwarding!
I remember playing this on my dads computer when I was little. I'm still very terrible. 10/10
"Classic is back, and with some new content and a lot of fixes/tweaks it's better then ever!"
It's as fun as I remember it 10+ years ago. Great RTS game.  10/10
"AoE HD is a wonderful throwback to the good old days of RTS gaming. The recreation maintains everything that made the original great, as well as adding in new features and factions to really help keep it fresh. I don't honestly notice the updated graphics as much as I notice the new factions and Windows 7 Compatibility, but it is still a great buy. Being an owner of the original, I struggled with the concept of dropping 20 dollars for a game I already possessed, but it was more than worth the 5 dollars I paid to secure it on sale. All in all, I'd recommend it, saying that it was a well-done revision of an old classic."
"Was a beast of a game years ago, and glad that it was on the steam sale so that I could get it cheap to play again"
I wish I was good at this game...
Classic remasterd
"Great game, full of nostalgic moments. The new civilizations, however, could be thought out better."
"Great makeover of an already amazing classic. If you like RTS games, I highly reccomend this game. Wondering if it's as great as the original? I fully vouch for it's authenticity. Never played an age of empires game? I urge you to try it. Great game all around."
10/10
This was a game I used to play day in and day out with my friends. I couldnt wait to get started! Back in the sattle again playing AOE2. While I do enjoy playing the game it self. I can say with 100% that the community for this game is terrible. I have played 4 total multiplayer matches and realized that the people that play this game are some of the worst gamers out there. I have not played this game in about 12 years.....I am rusty....I am sorry I have a full time job and cant play 24/7. I think it's silly to bash a player that is clearly new. I never do it in games that I do play often because I want the game to grow and for new players to feel welcome. This community reminds me of the WOW community and that's a terribly sad fact. I regret my purchase. I bought this game for the multiplayer but I will probably uninstall due to the way this community treats new players.   The game itself is actually quite nice. I have fun with the single player but it's not really enough for me to keep going. I am impressed with that they were able to do but if you want to play multiplayer and you are going to need more than 20 sec. to learn the way the game is played in multiplayer matches then you better move along. I suggest 'Wargame: Red Dragon' that is a good game with a pretty decent community.
"I attacked a village of Chinese farmers with 100 Armoured Elephants.  10/10, WILL stampede again."
Great Game!
Just as good as I remember.
Esentially a graphical update to the original AoE II. This was a great game back in it's day and it still is today. A must have for fans of RTS.
Age of Empires 2 HD is awesome. I played AoE2 many years ago and it's still fun. If you have played this game before so buy it now!
"age old classic + way better graphics = you cant loose, HIGHLY recommended!"
Still a great game. Reminds me of my childhood
One of my favorite games of all time!!!
This is a great game remake. Still fun and I still loss myself with in it. If you have played it before it is worth the buy.
"Worker shuffled around aimlessy making odd noises and being useless, would play again, 100/10"
Good times. Love this.
This is an absolutely fantastic game! It's fun to play with friends and even by yourself!
This is a great remake of the original game.
"Ah, a great childhood memory. Your lucky (like me) if this game was part of your childhood (along with Star Wars Battlefront II). my memory of this game is great, but i dont remember how good the graphic were, that makes me IFy saying the the HD part of this doesnt seem to make a huge difference. Also the multiplayer makes the game a bit slower and have lag spikes at times, but that is exspected. If you played this as a kid, and you want to play it again, definatly get it."
"Was a great game then, still is now. Graphics aren't great by today's standards even though they've been up-res'd, and the multiplayer is a bit laggy, but it's still an awesome game."
"Same great game from when I was a kid but with cleaner graphics, smoother gameplay, and new features. Definitely a good buy"
Fun game although it takes alot to remember everything in it.
Great game. I grew up loving it but always had one major issue. I run dual monitors and the original game would not run in window mode. They have fixed that issue with this version! Now I can play the game and watch movies at the same time.
"This. Is. The. Best. Strategy. Game. Of. Its. Time.  This HD edition of the old school AoE II game is beyond worth it. Replay the greatest strategy game of it's type with boosted graphics and steam connectability! Beyond that, the new civilisations added in the DLC make this game almost brand new for those who used to play it.  A must have for all strategy players!"
Haven't played for long but It is very fun and I can't wait to play more!!!
Great game heaps of new stuff and added campaign but please FIX THE DAMN LAG ITS TERRIBLE!!
Great game
By far the best of Age of Empires for me. I love having full control over the entire world down to the point of individual villagers. I already know that many hours of my life will be sacrificed for this game.
"An old classic. This brings back memories from several years ago, playing with my friends and cousin. It's about as pure an RTS as the genre goes. Plays well and looks good (for its age). Newcomers may be put off by the lack of eye candy but if you are in to RTS games at all I definitly recommend it."
"New Update with the new AI runs terribly. I have a great computer, but playing with more then 3 of the new AI computers at once lags like crazy. Going any higher than that is unthinkable, especailly on larger maps. Otherwise, the game is fine. Just optimization problems for large matches and matches involving the new ai."
"classics never get old, this is the best example. funny, tactical, brutal multiplayer with friends. highly reccomended :)"
Buy this for the realistic fire.
Basically the original game but higher res and an updated multiplayer functionality.
Imagine StarCraft meets Civilization. And you don't have to bother ripping the story apart.
"Oh the nostalgia. Bit of lag at times during big battles but overall a great remake, new AI is good!"
"I remember playing this as a child and loving it, and when I realized that it was available on steam, I jumped at the opportunity to play it again. Compared to newer strategy games, it doesn't have the best graphics and can be a little laggy at some points (might just be on my end), but overall, it doesn't take away from the gameplay as a whole. Especially with the expansion, there are a multitude of different civilizations to choose from with there different strengths and perks. A very enjoyable game and a bit of a nostalgia factor for me, but I would definitely give it a try if your into these types of games. It will deliver!"
"seriously just lost hours of my life. game is so addictive. was true 10 years ago, even more so now."
I'm pretty sure they stole this game from Ensemble Studios. i'm not even joking it's the same game
Brings back memories  I may have cvhanged of the years but the classics haven't Defintly a must have game 
"Well, let's get this straight. The game is totally awesome... But intense multitasking skillz are required, which i don't have :C That's all i can say"
best way to spend 4 hours...
"This game is the biggest waste of time, but also the funnest game i have played in a whil ♥♥♥♥ YEAH HORSES"
"Pretty awesome, water looks heaps better but not much else, still an awesome classic."
France can finally win. ♥♥♥♥ yeah 10/10
Awesome update for a classic game! The new map size is freaking   HUGE!  
"One of my favorite's growing up, and definitely still a favorite now."
"If you are a fan of strategy games, this is worth looking into. Old school gameplay with improved graphics. Campaigns are frustrating and challenging at the same time. The downsides are the game mechanics. It is a bit clunky especially during massives battles and the HD version is still not as good as it should be."
"I never thought it would be possible to play this even more now than I did when I was younger, but holy crap is this game still awesome. Got it for 5 bucks during 2013's winter sale, and got my money's worth and more; even better, the extra campaigns, maps, and especially civilizations included with The Forgotten expansion make it even better than I remember. Time has aged well for you, Age of Empires 2. Wish I could say the same for your brothers 1 and 3."
"From the first PC game i ever played (When i was like 5 years old) to a HD re-release on steam, this game never gets old and you learn to look past the 2.5D graphics to enjoy the gameplay."
"Nice game, have playing AOE since 2006 never gets old :)"
Just as amazing as it was when i played it when I was younger. With steam backing the mutliplayer totally worth it.
Haven't played a good new RTS in years. Good thing they are updating old ones.
"Same old game that I love when growing up nothing really was fixed with the game issue. They just made it HD. I would recommend getting this game when its on sale, $19.00 is a bit overpriced for something that is old and problems are not fixed with it.  Something else to point out is that there is cheating within this game if you play custom games some people remake the map and add features in there to help them win.    If you play just normal games there is not much cheating there unless the host (when in the lobby) has rules that some people don't agree with later in the game.  I've played this game for many years and its always one of my fall back games when I get bord with other games. I play with a great clan also for more then 10 years now  www.csaclan.org  being in this clan helps keep this game fun and we are really active on  voobly.com "
"I can't do justice to this classic. All I can say is that its worth any price. This is one of my top games of all times. The shere addictive replay value of this game just can't be overstated. I've been playing this game for over a decade and am not even close to tiring of it.  The campaign is a wonderful diversion but AoE:II's true charm is in its multiplayer. I have so many childhood memories of playing this game over LAN with my father and uncle. We'd Co-Op vs Intermediate AI in random maps, though usually we'd venture into the Black Forest.  I was mortified when AoE:II became lost in time due to incompatibility with modern PCs, so now I'm so excited that those childhood memories can come back to life. Thank you Steam! (and Microsoft)"
Age of Empires II is one of the best games i have played.
I love the max population of 500!
It's a classic for a reason.
Played the original when i was 4.  Saw this...and i had a nostalga-gasim
Brings so much memories from my childhood !  This is one of the best strategy games ever made. Defenetly worth buying :)
"It's AoE. Does anything else need to be said? It's a classic! If you don't have it, buy it xD"
Nothing better than hitting a trapped enemy king with a trebuchet. 
Ive had quite a fun time with this game. I dont like getting attacked and my stone getting mooched on but yeah love this game
"I would recommend this HD remake of the classic made by  Ensemble Studios : to any player who is interested into strategy games where you get to have a bird's-eye view of the landscape you discovered that was previously obstructed by fog of war. These types of games must fall into a sort of specific genre of game; that category must have a name - a name that is unknown to me. The amount of civilisations, or in this case, I dub them as 'Ways to Play'; allow a variety of plans to come up with that may lead to your victory. These 'Ways to Play' sometimes counter eachother - resulting in a huge 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' - which, I like. In the beginning of the match, there is always some suspense to find your enemies and pounce upon them before they can counter you with defences and offensive tactics. This suspense makes you flutter for your ressources and build all your barracks, archery ranges, stables, docks, etc. In the meantime, your enemies are doing the same. As a result, you will have great wars between eachother with only one sole victor. These wars are actually hilarious if you have my perspective upon it; the hilarity actually improved between old and new games as the new game has an increased possible maximum population of 500, instead of 200   - a well awaited buff for the Huns  . The overall improvement between the 1999's release, and 2013's, is the graphics and quality of the game. Looking back at the old disc, I noticed more &lt;&lt;Yucky&gt;&gt; detailing and far less attention to the pixel art. This was to suit the computer monitors' resolutions at the time; it was actually astound at the time. The old release also had worse quality music and sounds that made the overall theme. My final mark (though may be slightly bias due to my nostalgia for this game) is:   9.9/10 "
"Good ol' Age of Empires II is back! Or sort of; perhaps not so much the 'good' part, but certainly the 'old' part. Why is that, thou may ask. Well, my friend, thou art exposing the major flaw of this game: it's still almost the same. ALMOST.  Making a port of an old game is not easy; you have to contemplate many aspects: keeping the same gameplay dynamics, but updating them with the features this generation has to offer. For example, this port adds Steamplay for easier matchmaking, rooms, achievements, and - the one that excites me the most - Steam Workshop support, for mods, maps, textures and sounds. Yay, now we can customize our game with a single click! Well, sort of.  Maybe it was a badly stablished development cycle; maybe it was that they rushed the final release before accuratelly testing every detail; or maybe it was they just wanted to fish for money with the pre-sale. Whatever the reason for this, what we have here is an incomplete product. And one can see it when doing what Age of Empires was made for: playing with somebody else, online. It's choppy, laggish, even playing in LAN; sometimes it makes the game rather unplayable. If you ever were into RTS games, you know that you need to have a steady connection to properly react to the events in the game. However, since giving an order will be around 3-5 seconds behind the unit actually carrying out that order, due to the delay, your plans will be destroyed just for losing those seconds. Imagine you get attacked by the enemy or wild animals, and you react quickly enough but your units don't obey right away; you'll end up losing units, resources and time.  There also seems to be some bugs with the Workshop system; unsuscribing doesn't remove the mods. Not even unload them. It's like after you installed them you'll have them forever. And game rooms, even if set to private, will be public to anyone, so if you just want to play with friends you'll have to kick everybody.  Finally, achievements don't work properly. Two weeks since release and they're still bugged. Yesterday I won a bunch of achievements without even meeting the requirements; and trust me, I didn't meet them, I was just playing around with the map editor, and didn't even test the map, and I won the 'destroyed 100 buildings in a single fight' achievement; I mean, come on.  I sincerely hope this will get updated, patched and finished in time. Don't get me wrong-- it's a fun game and I love it just as I loved it before. But come on, you can do a better product to meet the expectations. I know you can fix it. Make me proud.  EDIT: The new expansion sucks, stay away from it. No voice dialogs, the edited races are okay I guess but the campaigns are not good enough, and the problems still persist.  EDIT 2: As of today I change my review to recommended because they fixed the multiplayer lag."
"This is a fun game I used to play a long time ago, and it still is a blast to play. Good times playing this game and works great on Windows 8.1. I give this game a 10/10 many years ago and still a 10/10 today!"
great gameplay you get to ♥♥♥♥ some castles up
"fun and worth the money, I say yes because I had alot of fun and I still do it is just one of those game that never really bore you easily. I took me months to be some what bored but I never stoped and here I am today playing it"
This seems harder than back when I was 8 years old... Still all time classic and sooo worth getting. Multiplayer is also fun as hell
"Good game, love the old graphics. brings back memories"
it's the greatest game of all time
ahh memories.....
Some classic RTS fun. Would buy again.
"Best game NA, 2 thumbs up, 11/10 IGN"
Awesome. Like Civilization meets Command &amp; Conquer. 8.9/10
Classic!
This game is like nostalgia in a bottle. Age of Empires II HD has the exact gameplay mechanics as its original but is looking a lot sharper! This game is perfect for the original players and also for the new as they want HD more then anything nowadays....
One of the best RTS games of all timme for sure.
Love this game! new civs look awesome!
One of the best RTS games ever made.
this game sucks 0/10  WOLOLO  This game is a example of how life should operate.  100000000000/10
Easily one of the best real time strategy games out there. Holds up very well despite being over 10 years old.
Love it!
I loved playing this in College... though I feel with this version and using it on stream finding people to play with just got a WHOLE lot easier. Can't wait to play through some more and see how it compares!
this is a good stradegy game
"Game hasn't really been improved at all. The only real difference is that the multiplayer actually works. The lag hasn't been fixed, you would have thought that was the first thing to on their list. Hot keys are a bit of a mess too.  The game is as good as the old version only with a more stable multiplayer."
Every game is like a trip back to 1999
"Age 2 HD does a great job retaining the feel of the original while adding some new and interesting features. I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and will continue to do so for many, many yeaers"
This game is an absolute classic. It may be a little hard for new players to get into - but ask your friends if they've played it before. If you can grab a friend - buy it for sure!
"Nostalgic game. Love playing AoE II HD. Despite loving playing the game, the keyboard shortcuts mechanics are outdated. I know it's hard to update that know. Still a very good game to play."
One of the greatest PC games ever made.
 A Definite Classic
The best out of the three.
The closest outlet one can have as wish-fulfillment should anybody wish that Chinese people never existed at any point in time.
"What can I say about this gem of a game, have beening playing it forever. Just one of those games that your stuck by even after years and never gets boring!"
"Hands down my favourite game of all-time, in HD edition, AI has improved a lot, making games against computer even hard to win, big recommendation"
"Not quite as I remembered it when I first played it YEARS ago, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing. To say the least, it has held up well enough to be fun to play with friends. Honestly, its up to you if you want to buy it, but I still say it is worth the small price to re-live some old memories."
You can't assign your hotkeys.... Wtf? why not? Is Steam just ♥♥♥♥♥♥? good game but how to play if you dont have your hotkeys omg.
Awesome game much pleased thanks all.
This is without a doubt my favorite age of empires. I have spent countless hours of my life in this game. In fact I grew up playing this game but was lost to me for a great number of years untill I found steam. The only thing I wish is they would put the original age of empires up for It was a close second and a challenging one on top of it. I have found that since I started playing agian I am alot better at this game just from the intellect I have gained growing up. Now after beeting this one I would like to beat the original
"I heard the best review from this game talking in relation to todays economics and religion, but have to say childhood and forever favourite game. If you have read this review, most likely you have played it if you are born 95- so yes its for everyone and educational :)"
A big improvement to an already great game
pretty good rts  sound files are fire
i bought this for my compaq computer. the compaq computer recently stopped working(its being real slow) therefore useless. and now i have a mc computer and it won't let me play it on here. it says the platform isn't right or something. so i need help on that..?
10/10 would wololo again
Been playing AoE I and AoE II since I was little with my brother. I still remember the dreams I had when I was sleeping in kindergarten. Great times and with this HD remake its even better.
A timeless classic I'm still playing 10-15 years later.
Great game i luv it its really well revamped recommended
Absolute Classic highly reccomend if you like Aoe
"Still by far one of the best RTS Games out there, this is really the 'BEES KNEES'. Along with the nastalgic feeling I feel as if everything about this game cries out. 'I AM THE BEST AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST.' In its own area, Age of Empires has really made its stamp on gaming history. As much as I dislike all the new phone apps. This game will always have a place in my library."
I have been a fan of this game since day one. I played it on the PC with the disc I bought since 2000! The updated version is excellent! Adding the 'unlocks' for the different civilizations is one thing I always thought was missing. I my mind it is THE greatest game of all time. I've loved every second that I've spent on it. Thanks for keeping this game alive and to continue to add new civilizations to it. As they say in the game 'Fight On!'
"Great multiplayer, Haven't really touched the singleplayer that much, Love the progression + KILL ALL THE GOATS 8/10 Strategy"
A classic RTS staple that just can't be beat 8.5/10
"Great Game, alone or with friends"
"Problem with the graphic sometimes, it's a good game nonetheless."
nice rework of the old version but the price is a little bit to high only for better graphics
"I played this game, when I was younger. I absolutely loved it. I got it on Steam to relive the moments. I just haven't been able to relieve the moments yet. If you're a person who had the original game. You're probably not going to want/buy this game considering that you've already paid for it, ages ago. The CD keys aren't redeemable on steam, it's going for US$ 20.00 it's a bad Price considering it was made in 1999.   If I enhanced the game, I would of put the price as $10.00, but that's just my opinion though. but believe me it is a great game, it was hailed as one of the best strategy games of it's day. If you're gaming taste is medieval/RTS it's right down your alley way. It also does have a map editor in the game. Which is great it's better than having to close down the game and open a separate program  I would probably have to rate it, 7/10 Garmes"
This game has some good memories...
Absolutly love this game. Have played for over a decade and can never get enough. Its just one of those games that grow on ya and always have a place in your heart.
Great game! Looking forward for the new expansions!
you know what this is and you know it's great
Great for reliving childhood glories... IT IS GOOD TO BE THE KING OF THE LOSERS
"Having recently reinstalled AOE HD including the latest patch I find it impossible to play even on easy difficulty, what used to be a very enjoyable and relaxing experience has now become a waste of time. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times over the past two days and no matter which game mode I play I am defeated every time, I am no stranger to AOE and have played on and off for many years, I will now seek to find my enjoyment elsewhere and AOE will be filed away never to be played again."
Great version of an old classic. I really wish the community was larger. I would play this so much more if there were more people online!
i remeber growing up and playing this game and i loved it now i can relive my childlife lol and still kick some butt lol
Still holds up as one of the best RTS released. I strongly recommend it.
"It's an old game, nice and spruced up in HD. Nothing changed in terms of gameplay, but that's a good thing. "
An old classic and one of the games I used to play a lot. The multiplayer mode is still fun. The graphics are obviously dated but the gameplay is still great.
"Coming from someone who greatly loved the Age of Empires series as a kid, I adore this HD remaster!"
A classic game redone in HD with some awesome changes like max units increased and HD graphics. Great buy!
"I remember taking a Journalism class in high school just to have access to the computer lab for 2 class periods, solely to play this game. It is the cornerstone of historical strategy games since it was released. The gameplay is easy enough for anyone to pick up quickly, but deep enough for established gamers to enjoy and get involved."
"I was thrilled when Steam brought back this old and well loved classic. Workshop support and newer graphics give this game a fresh new face, and the new expansion brought new life back into this classic. I was skeptical at first, since I still have the original game disks buried somewhere, but the additional content and steam support makes this game well worth the purchase."
Just as awesome as the old version. No need for fixing that lame grapics bug because in HD its back up to date.  Some improved game mechanics. And much more troops! If you liked the old one. Get it. Play it. Love it!
Feels just like the original. Textures are updated slightly but not much has changed. There are some textures in the workshop that help a little.
"The English are terrorising all of Scotland, and it's time for you to fight back... again!"
"Well worth the purchase, have spent many good fun hours with my mates at LANS. Brings back the good old days of playing on windows 95 computers."
Classic. Runs on anything. I always lose. 10/10.
simply a classic rts
♥♥♥♥in' great game ♥♥♥♥ buy it
I grew up with this game and it is by far my favourite strategy game. Definitely worth the money. I would gladly pay $80 for this amazing game. A bit hard to master but its worth it. Great game 8/8.
Probably on of my all time favorites. I remember playing this when i was in school with all my friends nearly 10 years ago. Still one of the best RTS games and the HD remake is fantastic.
"Just played a five hour session with one of my friends, it was rediculous"
"Still a good game. It's however not really HD. I think it runs at 720p and widescreen, which is a step up from the original. I also have a problem with the sound that every time I tab out of the game and then enters it again it resets the volume in windows to half of the system max volume. Which is a problem since the game is rather loud."
"It's really upsetting that there is no lan support, which was avaiable in the original game."
"Wonderful game, very good memories stem from it. For those uninitiated with the franchise, it is a fast paced RTS with a focus on advancing 'ages,' in order to perfect technologies and ultimately conquer the map. The AI have been updated in the HD edition, so it really is a consistent challenge. I've lost so many games on here, its laughable. What keeps it interesting to me is the huge variety of strategies available to win. There are also many different enviornments. Deserts, Islands, Forrests, etc. The community is also still active, with many active site forums discussing strategies and fun game moments. I'm addicted, and i'm not even very good. I'd recomend this to almost anyone."
Age of Empires is a great game. That requires skill and strategy&gt;
"This game has the dubious honour of beating out many terribly ported games to be one of the worst ports I've ever played. However, it also possesses the far less dubious honour of being one of the finest RTS games ever designed, whose original version sadly no longer works on modern versions of windows. It's on sale semi-regularly, so i'd advocate picking it up then."
"Really funny to play with friends totally recommend 11/10 Golden fedoras, fun for the whole family both for ladies and dongers!"
"good game, aint played it since i was a kid... fuun times"
"If you liked the original AoE II and basically want to replace that game with a slightly better copy (because your CD is gone or wont work), then this is for you.  If you want something different from AoE II, then don't get this because its basically the same.   I used my AOE II CD to play this game on and off on various computers for the last 15 years or so, starting as a kid. When I tried to use it on Windows 8.2, it was no longer compatible so I bought this. I'm happy with it because I would have been happy just to play from the old CD I got in the '90s, but my only curiousity is that this 'AoE II HD' appears to be exactly the same as the origial AOE II. Unless my memory is failing me, everything looks exactly the same. They did add some options and clarify some writing in the random map set up, and now I can easily play multiplayer. And I can add free new graphics through community-made add ons. They said they improved the AI. But yeah, other than those things, not much changed, which is fine with me but some people might be expecting something new.  As far as the game itself goes, I've enjoyed this game for a long time. Theres a lot of creative strategies you can make with it (although the army and war based strategies are more robust and varied than more peaceful ones) and a long list of maps types and civilizations that add a lot of spice to your tactics. These sort of 2D graphics arent terrible but theyre not going to really impress compared to the modern 3D endless camera angles style of many games, but this game isnt really about graphics (although some of the community-made stuff is pretty beautiful). It's about strategy, building economy, reliving historial battles, and maybe going head to head with your friends in online multiplayer (or working together as allies to bring down random strangers from across the world lol). Its fun, and replayable. There's a reason I keep coming back to this game for the last decade and a half. :)"
"what can I say that hasn't been said?, I love this game since I was a kid. I really recommend it."
If you need to read a review to decide on buying this game then maybe you shouldn't buy it. It's Age of freakin' Empires!
"Lets be honest its the same good old AoE II with same AI issues as it had years back. Worth buying if you want to check Forgotten Empire extension which adds new things.  Cant say much about multi yet. But its another reason to buy it if you have people to play with, despite some awfull server stability. This game is legend."
I recommend this game.
classic game in an awesome series of games now if only we could finally get an aoe4
its real good ay
I have always loved this game and bringing back multiplayer was a great move
World best game ever .... I am playing from last 15 Years ... Awesome as HELL
Best strategy game all of the time
"I love AOE Series I always have always will. Thanks for another addition to the series peeps. Players please take note in this version of AOE 2 cetain parts of the game play have changed, something added and some things have been lost."
"Has the RTS genre died? Today, most of the games seem to be sandboxes, RPG's, FPS's...but not many companies make good RTS's anymore.  This is after all those years still one of the best RTS's ever made. I'm not judging the price (it's an old game after all), but if you are in love with the RTS genre, you will definitely love this one.  There seems to be some lagg at multiplayer mode, though. Hope it gets fixed soon."
I like this game.
"A fantastic real time strategy game that I have been playing nearly all my life! Diverse maps, civilizations and campaigns. Multiplayer is almost flawless and this game is well worth the money."
"great reminder to the good old days, worth buying by anyone"
"Age of Empires 2 is my favorite game of all time.... Some people may think that the HD edition is a waste of money, but I say if it's in sale GET IT! You will have a lot of fun and I would recommend buying the Forgotten dlc too, it adds a lot of new campaigns! Also I didn't know this game had music, must have bee a glitch on my CD-Rom."
"Had a 10 hours and 45 minutes straight match against my best friend, really epic game 10/10."
War Elephant Simulator 2014.... 10/10
"This game. This game is hours of fun, you'll go through a 2 or 3 hour game and it'll only feel like 30 minutes. Absolute classic, must have."
"This was the first strategy game I ever bought. I got it when it first came out, ordered it through the Scholastics magazines they give every month in elementary school. I played for hours and hours, creating maps and campaigns. I find it a masterpiece of story and gameplay. Funny, I was thinking I wanted to play it when voila, 75% off."
"The graphics updates were minimal. It is nice to have a widescreen format. There are new campaigns that are fun to play. Overall, I wish they would have improved load times, and improved the graphics more than just making them HD for the sale price $20."
"This is my childhood. Even better now the game is re-launched in glorious HD, Plus it also has steam workshop support that has tons of mods to add (not that the game needs them). The game is worth the price 100%."
"Serious lag issues in single-player against the computer. Computer's specs are not an issue, multiple forums and threads visited with regards to this problem and no solution/workaround, let alone a patch. Other than that, it's a gorgeous rendition of a great game. The AI is VASTLY improved from before and actually a challenge on higher difficulty levels, and the new civilizations in the Forgotten expansion are lots of fun and creatively integrated into the game. If they fixed the lag issue, I'd give 10/10. As is, 4.5/10 for playability."
"One of the main things I like about age of empires 2, is that thier is no limit on building towers since there is in fact a limit in age of empires 3 even though you dont need a supply depot when collecting wood, gold and food while in age of empires 2, you do for every supply source."
11/10 'Would slice up stone castles with iron swords again!'
"My favorite game during my adolesence, played so much of this at least 500 hours. Great game, worth it on sale for sure."
I recommend this game. I have played this since I was 10 years old!
"Awesome game as always and pretty good improvement over the original. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is still quite buggy."
"One of the best RTS games out there along with Dawn of War, Warcraft 3 Reign of chaos, some of the C&amp;C games.   I also recommend Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds which uses same engine as AoE2, even if you don't care for star wars."
Amazing Game!!! My favorite game from my childhood and still is my favorite game....and a must have!!
"This game will never die, would buy again. 10/10"
EVERYBODY SHOULD BUY THIS ITS THE ♥♥♥♥
"I recommend AOE 2 but I don't recommend the recent addon.  I'm giving this review a 'Yes' just because of the original game. The expansion that came out about some Eastern European medieval states is historically inaccurate and it makes me regret my purchase of it.   I found it good that this area of Europe is finally addressed in an AOE game but at the same time it is sad that the developers left out (seemingly purposely) the proto romanian states: Wallachia, Moldavia and Transilvania, which ended up forming the culture, language and people of todays' Romania. The campaign about Dracula is just a cheap effort of getting people who've heard of him into buying this expansion. It has nothing to do with history or who Vlad the Impaler really was.   I just find it sad that historically relevant proto romanian leaders and their wars are completely ommited (ex. Stefan the Great, Mihai the Brave, Mircea the Old, Gelu, Menumorut, etc.). They too had a large impact within that part of Europe and have helped in shaping its history. It is also important to note that the Magyars and the Slavs were not the only cultural identities in Eastern Europe. Although modern day romanian has clearly been influenced by slavic, german, magyar, turkish cultures, its base is still of latin origin and the identity of those proto romanian states could have easily been used to create an ingame playable people."
Wololo
"Awesome, though it would be nice if they backed down and fixed some of the mechanics"
best game of the 20th century
This game is the perfect for people who love real time strategy and history.
This is almost better than my pirated version of the game.
I grew up playing this game! It is one of the best RTS games out there!
An instant classic. I remember growing up to the monks and there 'Wololo' chants. I could never convert anyone at school though.... A must get! The quality is great but still that old school feel that made everything about this game fantastic
"The greatest ancient civilization strategy game of all time, worth the purchase!"
"Awesome strategy game that was my first ever childhood game, the Edit Map gamemode allows you to make your own scenarios and campaign which you can also play other people's creations and the singleplayer gamemode that allows you to play real historical figures in the Medieval times."
Would not recommand this game for online multiplayer. Online multiplayer is extremely laggy to a point where it is unplayable. There hasn't been a fix for months.   Would be happy to change my recommandation if there is a fix.  
Amazing Game who Like to RULE THE DAM WORLD
Legendary that its still so good this many years after it was originally released
I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel like I'm playing DLC Quest since I have to pay for DLCs to play default civs.
"Always loved this game. Loads of fun, limitless play."
"last patch/DLC broke the want to play the game. did not purchase African content.  -&gt;CANNOT RESTORE GAMES!!!!!&lt;-  would like to post this on a report so the devs can fix this but forum is unavaible, so will wave off folks that remember the awsome old game it was."
Was a awesome game back in the day. Now the expansions have caused errors mainly with the FPS and it annoying to play. Please fix this and othr errors instead of bringing out more DLC packs.
Has to be one of the best god damn games i have ever played :3 1. Easy to learn. 2. fun to play. 3. and you acculy get to lear stuff about the civilizations you can play as. :D
AWESOME NEED FRIENDS TO PLAY IT THOUGH
"after downloading, it worked beautifully for three days. now I can't launch the game. It tells me every time that there is already an instance of the game running. I've tried multiple tips and tricks to no avail. I am still unable to play. Starting to really ♥♥♥♥ me off. I haven't found any help on the matter."
WOLOLO  10/10 would convert again
"Had a problem with framerate while I was moving the mouse. It was fixed by updating my video cards drivers. Game runs fine now. Gotta change my negative review to a positive one. So, if you are prepared to once again waste literal DAYS of your life building an empire and micromanage your peons then get on it! New to the game? Prepare for old as frack graphics, and learn to micromanage an empire against second rate AI. Oldie but a goodie."
Still one of the greatest RTS games ever created.
"Hello Steam Crew, I have been playing AoE II for a while and one big problem is that there is no unpause button nore a pause limit. The enemy team was losing last night and they have paused the game. Now it has been like 20 h and we are still waiting. We dont quit either because I want my rank! I wont give up to such a dirty trick! Please help.  Best Regards "
"I used to really like this game, and it is a good game. I give it a thumbs down, though, because this version doesn't add any tangible value. In the new campaign they had really bad taste, and put dirty language in. Also, they have a 'Dracula' campaign - how dissapointing. When people run out of creativity they resort to useless and dirty things."
"Here go the pack of teutons knight's.... And our Templar code is Veni, Vidi, Vici!"
Now i remember when i was kid and i played this game 24/7.  11/10 #olddays
Took me straight back to my early days!
"0/5, the game is unplayable because of lag every 5-10 seconds. Tried to play the game with friend and game freezes after 10 mins playing. Hope the lag issue will be solved soon...  (120 mb/s down, 50 mb/s up..)  Aspidov"
"Pros: -ah that classic nostalgia -great brand new features and countries dlc -the old cheatcodes still work -wololololooo Cons: -not all that historically/culturally accurate -too expensive unless bought on sale (I got it and all dlc for 12, that's a fair price) with some exceptions country units and buildings are all the same. Aztecs and Koreans can get mostly the same basic units, that makes no sense.  -voice acting is terrible, albeit better than reading their tiny character scripts  -AI isn't varied in strategy (example they only produce the same 3 units over and over) -if you're country is from Africa, why are you white? 'Oh my god Karen you can't just ask someone why they're white.'"
worked for a wile now game wont open 
its age of empires with higher pop cap what more do you want 
"Great game, while not too dissimilar from other RTS in terms of gameplay. The variety of civilizations, game modes, maps and playstyles that this game provides makes it an instant classic. Whilst the graphics are not up to pay by even today's lower tier computers, no other civilization RTS has comes close. 8/10."
"This game is the game i base all rts games on. It is exactly like the old one, but with more gameplay, better graphics, and a community to back it. I definitely recommend!"
One of the most beloved RTS games of my generation. Defiantly pick this up
Great Game So many good Memorys love the new hd textures
"What can I say? It's a classic. Although I still have my old installation CDs from 1999, I did purchase the Steam version and expansion, and I don't regret it. The new campaigns are fun, and the steam connectivity makes group games easy. I still have massive multiplayer battles with my younger brother, despite living four hours away, just like we did all through school."
"This game brings back all those old school gaming days, but with updated graphics"
Just like the original one. but better.
"Though this game is pretty old but I started playing when i was like 14 years old, this game is highly strategical for which I used to spend 10-12 hours playing this game all day when my exams used to get over. After that i came to know that we can play multiplayer also that turned into an endless fun especially CBA and all that. I'm very much thankful to the devs for reviving my childhood game. It's a must have for all the 90's kids."
"Amazing , rly good fun would 10/10 recomend. "
This some dank game man! Dem good Graphics! :))
Nice remake of the original if u liked th eold u will love the hd edition
The game of my childhood in HD resolution. Awesome!
Really good classic strategy game. Looks better than original version of the game. Not that hard to get on multiplayer match which is something I like. The game is old but if don't mind playing old games then you would like the game.
Always forgetting that catapults destroy my own units    10/10
Nothing can beat AoE1 but still alot of fun :D
"I loved this game when I was a kid. Actually I hated it, because I was addicted to it.  Still good for wasting time, all these years later."
What the hell are you waiting for? Buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game you piece of ♥♥♥♥.
"One of the best strategy games even now ! i enjoy it a lot, it is worth every penny !  "
really really good &lt;3
"Good game, fun to play."
omfg finally *-*
This series is one of my favorite and playing in HD is even better. I'd highly recommend buying it espically for this $4 sale!
"I'm changing this review and retracting every good thing I've said about this game. Microsoft has shown with the newest expansion that it doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore and simple wants to milk the money out of wallets for a buggy, unfinished and clearly made cash cow DLC expansion. Avoid this game like the plague, buy the original version instead of this pathetic garbage."
"Perfect game, so much Nostalgie"
"This game is great. Here's my reasons.  Gameplay: The basics are very easy to master, from collecting resources at the start, to end-game massive wars that take place somewhere on the map. Once you get the hang of it, advanced techniques that you will pick up later on will help you gain more resources and create a larger more efficient army. Real world war-time strategies do work in this game to a certain extent. The game has a multitude of different nations each with their own specialities and weaknesses. This gives the player a huge amount of space to play, you could be a early-game rusher, or be a late-game fortress.  Graphics: The buildings and troops are easily distinguishable and the game is as great as it is, however if your eyes still burn from the 'horrible' graphics as you say. The steam workshop provides its huge array of textures and in some cases, sound. The textures you can find there will absolutely give your game a facelift, however your computer might suffer from fps drops depending on the mods added."
Good game. 8/10 would play again. Recommended for those who have played the original AoE and for those who like this kind of strategy games as this is one of the best in its genre.
Fantastic update on a classic!
"Actually, ı was try to open this game. But ı cant open this game on Steam Library since one week. I am trying too many way to open it but also ı cant open this game. is this a diffrent problem or other some person have this problem? How can ı find an answer for this problem? thanks."
"Oh the nostalgia is real, i cant believe this game was brought back from my childhood, love it!"
The greatest game of all time
"One the best RTS games of all time gets an HD overhaul. A better game engine that provides higher resolutions, more units on screen without lag, higher population limits, Steam multiplayer support, and more.  A must own for any fans of the classic Age of Empires series."
"The best RTS game ever, with the most replay value. Unmatched."
"Age of Empires remade to work on all modern machines, with few new features. Nothing extraordinary, but you simply can't go wrong with this one."
your friends will always be better than you  A+++++
"I just have to say, I love this game.  Its old. Its rusty. Sometimes it spits out smoke when I turn it on. And I love it.  If you're a strategy-game fanatic, ever enjoyed Supreme Commander or Rise of Nations, or if you just like games, this is for you."
N O S T A L G I A
It's an great game i bought it played if for about 2 hour's and loved the each minute of it.
"Age of Empires II recaptures its status as a classic with an HD remake filled to the brim with content.   With eight campaigns, a robust multiplayer, Steam Workshop integration for modders and a map editor, strategy fans will find that Age of Empires II HD is definitely worth the price of admission.  The only downside is when played on a lower spec machine, in a multiplayer game there can be some quite visible slowdown, but what more can we ask of a 14 year old engine."
bad ♥♥♥ old school ♥♥♥♥
"Since the game is now patched, I honestly think the game has surpassed expectations. As challenging and fun as ever, AoE II is still one of my favorite strategy games of all time, and for good reason.   4.9/5 stars given that there are actually achievements for winning 1000 (yes...one thousand) battles with each civilization. I could put hundreds of hours into this game and be lucky if I came out with one of those. I plan to put plenty of hours, but hundreds with EACH CIV? No."
Good Old Times
The best RTS ever. Played it since the non HD edition. Still RTS Nirvana.
"What a wonderful place to be in, its great the first time you jump on that horse. Happuy gamings Ya'LL"
"Why would you not buy this?   The best age of empires remade with more maps and more civilizations, the forgotten even gives you more campaigns, excellent stuff!"
"It hasn't really updated as much as I would have hoped, but it's still a nice reboot of one of my favorite games of all time. If you were a big fan of the original, I would say give this a shot."
"This game is certainly a classic. It is deserving of this designation because it continues to fascinate, entertain and excite players of all ages.   Using civilizations, technolgies and units based on real world history, it creates a special sesne of reality, a connection to the real world. There are even historical writings and info sheets in the game for the more interested player.  A game of strategy, patience and perserverence, Age of Empires II is a great alternative to the violent 'instant gratification' releases too common in the market. This is a game for thinkers.  With an excellent campaign mode, an outstanding multiplayer mode, and a satisfying map creation tool, there is plenty to do. The variety of options, modes and maps in multiplayer is part of the reason why the re-play value of the game is so high; there is rarely a repeat scenario and every game is truly unique.  Admittedly, the game mechanics/game play is redundant, but are any RTS games any different? Every new game is an opportunity to master a skill, experiment with a new tactic or strategy or improve speed.  There is a reason this game was revisited and re-released. There is a reason it is even available on steam. There is a reason you should play it, so listen to a voice of reason and play Age of Empires II."
"I love this game... but sometimes the computer does the stupidest things, making your units go the LONG way around when in the old version you would take the short way. I still like this game, though and highly recommend it for those who love the franchise, to all others... I can neither recommend nor discourage you from buying this game."
"Epic game back in the day and the hype has lived on, a must buy and dont be fooled by AoE3 fine graphics and good reviews the follow up has nothing on this. NOTHING!"
"Classic Throwback all the way. Greatest game ive played in a while, now if only they would remake half the old school games like this"
"Meh. Unless you are an original fan of the game and are after the old svhool times, this game is quite outdated. The 'HD' part is barely any different to what I remember from the original, and its features are all the same. Lets face it, this was made in an era when the best stratagy in these games was to have the bigger army. It was good, for a little bit."
"This game has always been one of the worlds best strategi games, it never gets old. I truly recommend this game to anyone that dosen't care about graphics, but belive me the graphics is still really nice. I like that they put in HD in old games it makes you wanna learn them all over again!  5/5 This game cant go wrong!"
"Ofcourse I have to recommend my favorite childhood game, but why u no Linux or mac support windows! greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :p"
been playing this since i was a kid Modern RTS games can still learn from this game
Great game I can't stop playing
Gives you the feeling of saying GG to someone before attacking their Base or multiple Bases it also give you the feeling to say GG and quit once they are 8 researchs ahead of you
Most Epic game of the century !
"Loved playing this game as a kid, still love it today! Great now that I can play with friends online."
Great game
"Grew up playing this game and have loved every second of it. One of my all time favourite games, love the gameplay, the art is amazing, I love everything about this game. For how old this game is its absolutly amazing. 10/10"
Nostalgia with a touch of HD resolution and new dlcs
One of the pillars of Real Time Strategy. The pinnacle of the AoE series and a true chess game of 200 Hundres Pieces to each player. Use your brain and your skills in this immortal classic. Guaranteed to love for hardcore gamers.
"Do NOT purchase this game if you are trying to play lan or multiplayer games with friends. They removed lan entirely and the lag in online multiplayer is unfixable and virtually unplayable. The single player and campaign is fine but the multiplayer is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up. Not worth purchasing.  Fixed the above, games great now."
Childhood of much nightmare of anothers AoE II it was my favorite game (actually too :´v) but what is it? its a real-time strategy game where you need to settle down and conquer or be conquered BTW graphics they made a good work on it but it was more noticeable the water and the fire   10/10 me godlike player simulator :v 
"The game of all games. The mother of all games. The game of thrones. The Game wars, the new hope. The Grand Theft Game. THE AGE OF GAMES.  10/10 horse archers hit and run strategies"
An oldie but still awesome!!!
"best with multiplayer, one of my favortites to play"
Very nice game
Love this game and the updates the have completed. Reminds me of the good times when I was a kid!
"I myself am a massive fan of the 'medieval era', and any sort of game revolving around it, whether that be an RPG, a strategy, or something completely different, I also strongly enjoy strategy games. Obviously, you don't want to be hearing my likes and dislikes, just the game review...  Where do I begin with this game; This game is overall an exceptional game! Although it being an old game just with slightly improved graphics, it is great, and the minor things that were at fault in the original are fixed in this version. I played the original for many hours and thus far haven't had the time to sink into this version, nevertheless I still fully appreciate what this game has to offer.  It's a pretty generic strategy game, but don't use that as a reason to not check this game out, the campaign is brilliant! There are multiple campaigns following the stories of different characters stretching back a couple thousand years, so there is a lot of variety, some of these characters being: Joan Of Arc, Genghis Khan or even William Wallace! And for each of the campaigns you use a selection of factions/countries such as: Britons, Celts, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolion, Goths and many, many more, all of which have unique special units and different tech trees for the extra advantage, but none of which are over-powered, they are all perfectly balanced, applying different buffs and debuffs.  In the few hours that I've played the 'HD Edition' I mostly played the Multiplayer, which allows you to play with any of the afformentioned factions with of course more, you can play large games with lots of people, being friends on Steam or random players across the world, or even AI! There is a large plethora of maps, ranging in sizes depending on how many players you have, you can even play maps based on real countries and that countries landscape!  As you have probably been wondering, if you are not sure, in this game (discluding the campaign and certain maps/game modes), you start with a small Town Centre in the Dark Age, along with some villagers, you can send these villagers off to build houses, barracks', mills, farms, or send them to chop wood, mine gold/stone, forage for berries, find sheep/turkeys to harvest for meat, then you can upgrade through the ages, each new age will require varying amounts of gold/food and once you have progressed you will be supplied with brand new upgrades, those of which you'll have to find out for yourself. You can then build an army with Archers, Swordsman, Cavalry, all of which have different types and upgrades, then you can destroy your enemys! There are however, other ways to win, but these you'll also have to find for yourself!  Overall, you can tell that I am a fan of this game, so I'd strongly recommend you buy it, and as of this review it is on the Christmas deal being only £2.99 (GDP), which is a bargain! This game is brilliant, great campaign, fun multiplayer, awesome AI, amazing skirmishes!"
I love Age of Empires I and II but I have requested a refund for the first time and wrote my first review simply to say that Age of Empires II HD is virtually unplayable. I played AoE since I was a kid on computers that were before Windows 95 OS that played these games perfectly. My card runs Skyrim on Ultra and I lag so bad in AoE single player that doing something as simple as building a structre or attacking has become almost impossible. The game is simply broken.
"This game has been a favorite of mine since October of 1995, when I got it for my 6th birthday. I haven't put it down yet. and the HD version is excellent"
"Thanks SO much for making an HD re-release! This game brings back SO many memories from the classic AoEII. It keeps all of the original aspects, and makes them better. My original disc doesn't work anymore, due to it being old, so this keeps me with AoE!"
Better than Star Craft &lt;3
"I remember playing Age of Empires II: Age of Kings when I was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller. I loved the game (and still do) and played it for hours. The addition of the Conquerors' expansion made it all the more joyful to play. I'm a casual gamer. I don't go out of my way to get better, I play to have fun. And I'm happy to say that even a decade and a half since I first played Age of Empires II, I still love the game. It's a nostalgic experience coupled with one of the best RTS systems ever, IMHO. If you're a player who knows this game, buy it and take a trip down memory lane. If you're new, buy this game and learn that an RTS from the turn of the century is capable of. Note: the AI is a carptonne better and may or may not cheat."
Great Game!
"it works gud now.  OLD REVIEW : laggy piece of crap, nothing is improved too. but works.  worth it if you want to play multiplayer. (with 1 second delay each action ofcourse)  10-20fps during huge battle. probs i need dual gtx 980 and overclocked i7 for this."
Cool game. I dare you to 1v1 me ;)
"One of the great classics of real time strategy that remains alive in the hearts of many of us, even though we may have moved on to more complex and sophisticated games from the Total War series and the Paradox Interactive games like Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings.   The fact that the game has been expanded and made better by fans just makes the game even better and more enjoyable if you remember anything since the last time you played, probably ages ago. One can try to relive the entertaining campaigns adding the new features made by fans of this HD Edition or face real players in Multiplayer mode, be it standalones or in teams.  More factions and units to play with, and some new techologies and skins for the new civilizations give more diveristy for people who remember the standard northern European buildings on one side and the Arabic ones on the other. It has been years since I last played this game, yet I already have over 100 hours reliving the 'old-school epicness' that Aoe 2 had given me over ten years ago."
"feels kinda like civilization,total war and its own little genre.9.5 out of 10.its worth 20 bucks.but if you can get it on sale like i did,go for it"
"Great game, played it on its original release and still pleased that it has held up the test of time."
"This HD remake is very, very good, i totally recommend it. Just bought it from the Midweek discount. It have the same campaigns, everything just in HD, better shadows, 3D water, characters and building a lot more detailed. It is the same Age of Kings and The Conquerors. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty awesome, i'm loving it, although it is the same old game (storyline and gameplay speaking), it feels like a new game with all the graphics renovations. This is the perfect remake for those who love the original AoE and wanna remember good old times, with a little more of flavor, as i am one of those, i give it 10/10"
its age of empirs in the HD!
this is the woast site ever
"AOEII HD is a really fun game. They did a great job updating it so that it can be played on modern computers. AOEII would not play on my Windows 8.1 desktop. This HD version from steam works great and looks great. Be careful when playing this game, it can be addictive."
"This game is all of my nostalgia. Text books be damned, this is where I learned everything I know about history.  This is one of my top 10 games of all time, for sure, but I'm so rusty at it that Salad Fingers likes to play with my nipples. Deffinately worth getting (again) thanks to updated graphics, new soundtrack additions, and Steam workshop compadability!"
What else is there to say about this game? Its a CLASSIC. Can't get enough of this one
Some games should remain happy memories. 15 years ago I loved it to bits but now it's a frustratingly dated experience. RTS has moved on as genre and no amount of 'definition' can bring AoE II up to snuff in 2014.
Soo many Memories. played since 1999.
"This game is awesome, i got it when it was 5 bucks so ya"
A legendary game which looks cool but is a bit too laggy when building armies over 50units strong.. other than that a great and solid game which it was back in the day
wololol simulator great game after all these years
One of my favorite childhood games. :D A good game to play to pass time.
this game is awesome
It was great back in 2000 and its still a great RTS to play with your friends.
"I had the disk to the original and I remember playing this game a lot. It is probably (I have too many games it is hard to decide :)) my favorite game, Ever! It has all I am looking for in a game Strategy, Adventure, Action and Lots of Things to do over all!    96\100"
"This is the first RTS I ever played when I was a little kid, and I LOVE the remake!"
Ruined my life. 10/10
Age of Empires was a seminal game of my childhood and the HD edition brings this back and allows multiplayer through Steam. There's not much more you could ask for in a strategy game. Buy it.
Love this game! Join us at  www.fraganimals.org 
HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON
"HD? If this was a HD remake, i guess this would make 'Last Airbender' look good. Horrible, most horrible cause for a remake. Online is laggy as crap. The 'A' attack button is horrible as when you use it it forces your units re-enter a line just to be slaughtered down to hell. Might as well not implement it at all. Gameplay also gets laggy as you progress further into the game. What kind of BullS__t is this? I don't recommend this game at all unless you can't 'withstand' nostalgic reasons or its over 75% off."
i enjoy these type of games
"Remembered this game. I don't mind the crappy DLC. I bought this game to destroy empires, flank and outflank my enemies, and for the RTS action, not for cinematics and crap."
Just re-living the good ole days.
"Age 2 with greater resolution, no compactibility problems and a pretty decent multiplayer, why not? =p"
If you haven't brought this game yet then......   Wolololoooooo!!   See now you're all better
"Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is alive and kicking? I mean a proper alive, not the 'oh we just updated the graphics for nostalgia's sake' so that some game artists can make a decent living. My previous review was written around the time the HD edition was released and I was banking on only nostalgia to validate my purchase -- but now there's been a new expansion and the competitive scene seems to have massively grown to the point where this is a viable RTS, online games and all. Video tutorials going in depth for each civilization, new strategies and tactics being developed today (this review being written on the 30th of December, 2015), and not quite 24/7 Twitch streams but still enough content during prime times to gain a following. Who'd have thought?  I've included my older review below, but it was mostly a self-indulgent tale of how I came to start playing this game and my appreciation for its revitalization -- but I never imagined that it would get to this point.  -----  I'll be honest, nostalgia was the biggest factor in my purchase of this game.  Age of Empires happens to hold a rather special place in my personal gaming history as it's one of the first purchases I immediately regretted. This was because I had accidentally purchased the expansion pack instead of the main game, thus was unable to play.   Now, there used to be a time where internet speeds were nowhere near fast enough to download nor even update games in a timely fashion (this was before youtube could even dream of being a thing). Game developers had to save any extra content they wanted to add onto a game and release it in a seperate box. Usually, these packs would contain a lot of content in order to create more value that could offset the cost of a physical release. The Sims franchise is about the only series that continues this tradition.  So, some innumerable years ago (only because I refuse to count) I was embarrassed because I had spent my allowance on the wrong game. This isn't really the focal point of my nostalgia, but to fully understand it I need to probe the depths of what memories I can find before I had a computer.  Backtracking further into the past, there was a point where I observed someone playing the original Age of Empires -- I think it was at a friend of the family's house. This happened at an age before I could be reasonably trusted to handle a computer, but like the supposed effect of playing Mozart and other classical musicians to a baby the image of this game burned itself into my subconscious somewhere. That or I simply couldn't stop talking about it. Maybe I substituted the normal games of pretend and imagination with my toys for more structured games and called it 'Age of Empires,' but trying to remember any of this is a rather futile effort. I'm not sure why or how but this game simply stuck with me.  I remember passing by a display of computer games some years later and immediately recognizing the title. There was a rush of excitement as I took hold of the box and confirmed what my memories were telling me. Yes, this was the sequel to that game you remember from so long ago. Yes, you do have the system requirements to play the game. Yes, this could happen today.  Turns out I was blinded by excitement, as previously mentioned. Eventually I did grab a compilation pack that included AoE II, AoE II: The Conquerors expansion, a gold edition of the original AoE, and a sound track. Holy ♥♥♥♥ did I play those games.   Playing now, I realized how terrible I used to be at the game. I'm not sure how I got through the campaign, except by sheer determination and just playing it over and over again. That and cheatcc. It's an old-school no-holds-barred RTS. The proper game was far too difficult for my past self, but at that age I could enjoy myself for days with the little laser riflement and the RPG-weilding cars as I simply cheated my way through the campaign and single-player content. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on the 12 year olds shooting untold numbers of faceless soldiers in games like Call of Duty, I was commiting time-travel genocide at that age. Over and over and over again.  But now that the story's done, there's an interesting competitive scene (still?) revolving around the game that surprised me. Found a ton of videos on youtube of people playing rather masterfully and it encouraged me to revise tactics and actually start beating some of those levels I found impossible (even on Easy). That being said, I'm still getting wrecked by the computer every now and then. The more things change, the more they stay the same.  It's a good game, but it's old. Little pathfinding errors are probably going to annoy you. This is for the fans of the old game who have lost their disc(s). Or those who still have their discs and just need an excuse to play again...  http://i.imgur.com/yCd8Epi.jpg "
Wololo Spam.  10/10
childhood
The king of RTS's.
10/10 would hun flush again
It's a really fun game to play with others
"This game was epic fun when It first came out, and its still Epic fun."
"One of the best strategic games there is! I enjoy that you can have a large LAN or a quick round with a buddy and it is always challenging yet fun, other than the lagginess of the game it is a five out of five! (Oh and I quite like that you can browse for servers to play on and have a challenge on whatever skill level you are at!)"
"A good old classic with a hard Ai , really challenging and worth buying if your a strategy gamer."
Possibly one of the greatest games of all time.
excellent game wouldnt play anyother game from 10 years ago but this one :)
the is really fun. it has changed from the first one. i think the game is over priced because you could get 1 and 2 with all the expansions on disc for $10
"One word: Nostalgia... A game from my childhood, a game I used to play and spend thousands of hours on... until the online servers for it got shut down...  I didn't know it was on steam too, so as soon as I saw it on steam, I didn't hesitate to buy it XD"
"A nostalgic journey to the past with little help from HD graphics. Don't expect mind to be blown, the game is the same. And that's a good thing, I just wish the 'improved' graphics were given less hype."
Old classic with better graphics awesome game :)
"I just played a quick game on 'Easiest'. The computer beat me to the castle age, a first for me, then sent troops in early on and walked all over me. Now grant it I could probably have done some things differently but this was most definitely NOT 'Eastiest'! I am a casual player, I hate PVP and PVP style tactics. When I play 'Easiest' I expect 'Easiest'. The game looks nice graphically, though I don't see much difference from the original to be honest. I will probably stick with playing the original where 'Easiest' is just that. I like to relax and play a slow game, not rush through it because the computer is trying to wipe me out as fast as possible, if I wanted that, I would have chosen a harder mode. I'm glad I got this on special at a low cost, it isn't worth much. I am not seeing anything more than I can get with the original and I don't have to connect online to play the original! There is a simple batch file you can run to play the original which solves the palette problems... it simply disables Explorer, runs the game, then re-enables it. Works with WIndows 7 for me.  taskkill /F /IM Explorer.exe age2_x1.exe Start explorer.exe"
"Retaining the mechanics, art style and setting ensure this game stays the timeless RTS gem it always was, but the new HD modifications introduce frustrating technical difficulties.  Details: The game is unplayable at population 200 for me, lags uncontrollably on a laptop that can otherwise handle Skyrim, Bioshock Infinite, Dota 2, etc. Much needed improvements to make the interface more useful have not been made. New campaigns and AI are worth very little when the community has already been producing and making available this content on the internet for free."
"This is a classic RTS right here. If you like building up a country, planningbattles, attacking, upgrading units to make them more powerful in the medieval times, this game is for you.  AOE II really came out in 1999 and it's expansion came out in 2000, but Age of Empires II HD made the game run great on today's computers running smooth and looking good, plus the old expansion from 2000 is already added into HD, the HD also added an online.  This game also has a very good easy to work map editor.  I very much suggest this game, it was the first RTS I ever played back in the early 2000s."
"My oldest game, and will ever be the best game and the best Age Of Empires of all times, copyright 1999"
Awesome game like the good old version! Love it!
"It's a really fun game, would like to see them improve upon the CPU's ability to controll higher populations, but over all - good time with friends"
How many ships does the AI want to build? Jesus Christ.
It´s Age of Empires!
"Recommended all day.  Been playing the series since i'm 7... 18 years later, i'm still on it.  If you never played Age of Empire, it's one of the best RTS ever made. And you will learn a bit of history along the way.  Fun, educating and you will definitely become a tyran in multiplayer. "
After 15 years is still one of the most playable RTS available! and being in HD now you can enjoy it pn your fancy big screen :) The Forgotten empires is a great expansion too :)
cool
"A classic is always a classic. It's a shame the resolution isn't changeble in the settings... (The old one, although with only 3 possible resolutions, they could be configured. Not in this one, especially bad for people with 2.5k or 4K monitors)"
I quess its something to do when im alone. as always
Perfection.
Decent game not what i thought it was tbh
a great remake of AOE II if you want a beutiful remade version of this game its definitly for you 8 and a half outta 10
Amazing game with great progression and multiplayer experiences 10/10.
"So like, been ages since I got Age of Empires again. I have a cracked version but its boring without the expansion and multiplayer after a point. So the sale is on and its for 3 dollars?? DAMN. Call my friends up, ask em to buy, they buy. Next morning, woke up, played a match with a freind of mine for 2 hours and like, i was being owned the entire match. I literally made my last unit run around in circles to avoid the 100 troops he had.... should have not made the map an island.  So yeah, damn good game, good memories, music isn't great though."
problem with multiplayer
"One of my favorite games reborn, the DLCs added to it don't seem to be bad and the mods for it has increased the gameplay."
Blast from the past.
"An old classic from my childhood that now has a new expansion(available as DLC) with new campaigns, maps, units, buildings, and civilizations. This all opens up a bit of new gameplay and strategies. I highly recommend this classic RTS game to anyone who are into RTS's in general but keep in mind this game is still old so it may not live up to your expectations if you compare to the other RTS' that are out there. Nostalgia nostalgia nostalgia...  Edit: I forgot to mention the multiplayer is highly unstable and can even cause high end PC's to lagg/freeze due to the instability; especially on the new bigger 'ludikris' map size, If you are looking for competetive multiplayer i do recommend this game at all; you will not have fun.  Edit 2: UPDATES BOYS, with the announcment that this game is getting more stability support and ANOTHER expansion with new units, civs maps and modes as announced in their 'Age of Empires II – The path forward' news article/thread i was so excited that this game will not be so broken and forgotten to time. in the near future i hope to read more about what is coming. Take my money now! Stay safe and keep Wolololoing!"
This is good game.
This is a great game but for some reason (which is unknown) i cant play multiplayer games. It just says that each time i try and ready up that the host isnt running the same version as everyone else. If anyone knows how to fix this plz tell me how!!!!!!
"A decent update of a great game of the past. It's just like it was. Forgotten expansion incoporates nice changes to the flow of the game.   I think it's mostly for single player though as multiplayer is plagued by insane lag issues.  The AI is more optimized than before but it still bugs out and units get stuck in chokes, causing an almost slide-show like lag in games. Developers need to take a 2nd look into the games engine and make the multiplayer experience lag free with high quality servers. I know it is a very old game with old coding but if there was a way to make the game utilize the full power of multicore cpu, as currently it only seems to use only one core exclusively.  So please steam/microsoft. 1) full hardware utilization cpu+gpu 2) higher quality servers, not p2p connections/region based multiplayer matching/servers  I'd still recommend this game for single player experience though. It's quite fun, can be challenging and rewarding. "
played this game from 99-2002 came back 6 months ago not as popular but still freaking awsome we all miss you ZONE
"Awesome in every way. Only complaint is that it seems like when I play a random game, it seems like it usully picks me as the last team I was, not 100% random: like if I was the Brittish last time its more than likley I will be the brittish again"
It's Age of Empires. Need I say more?
One of the best strategy games there are.
Never trust the Chinese.
one of the best strategy games i ever played ANd i have played it for 10 years on and off and got over a 1000Hours on it possibly more but thats off steam so far allmost a 100Hours and still rising i love the game and i do recomend it if you are a true strategy lover this game is unkillable in my oppinion
This game is one of the greatest strategy games in existence. Easy to learn and fun to play for all ages.
"What you see is what you get. A nice little resource management war RTS. It's a bit dated, but if you loved it before the Steam version does bring enough of an improvement to make it worth the $15."
"This game was all my childhood, and it's back. Great game, really fun, brought me hours of pleasure and my childhood back. Buy it now, seriously, you won't regret it. ALL HAIL KING OF THE LOSERS"
"Classic RTS, every gamer should posses and be able to play."
"Very fun game, with lots to do. Plenty of campaigns, multi-player mode that is exceptionally fun, scenario creator, and plenty more.  I initially played this game when I was a little kid, and it has certainly aged well in my opinion. The price is a little steep, so I would recommend waiting until it goes on sale. The DLC is also not bad, adding a few extra campaigns for a few more dollars."
"Age of Empires II was always a fantastic game. My family and I have played since it first released, and still whip it out today on occasion. It's never gotten old. By all means, I am glad someone worked to bring this game forward to modern systems, allowing it to be enjoyed for many years more.  However, there are a few issues we had with this new version. Several changes are a minor issue. The new AI is ridiculous, acting more like a highly coordinated swarm. Buildings and units are scattered, all moving independently, and good heavens if one spots your army all units converge on your location immediately. This style of AI makes it extremely difficult when you they AI makes ranged units, or even bloody monks. With regard to their cities, the new AI fixes some building placement flaws (not as many castles built in back), but many times I now see the AI scattering mines randomly outside their city, and on multiple occasions had to smash my way through a 4-deep wall of bombard towers. It's cute, and actually kind of fun... sometimes. The old AI, while admittedly flawed in ways, at least acted human in ways, moving troops in groups. While I could once defeat the old AI in 1v1 on Hard difficulty no problem, I now struggle with Standard, often dying very early in the game, and I'm no RTS noob. This all said, there is an option to choose between the new AI or the old - last I played, at least. Both have their flaws and perks, so really it's a matter of preference.  Also, I don't really care that it's HD. I just want to play the game, and got along just fine without HD for over a decade. This wouldn't be a problem for me if there were an option to adjust the resolution and some graphics settings. This HD edition makes modern systems very laggy that, while low-power by todays standards, could demolish any game put out when AoEII was introduced. Kind of ridiculous, I think. Especially when not much has actually improved visually, in my opinion.  But really, who cares. This is a classic. I'm simply overjoyed that somebody brought it back, and understand that renewing old games with old engines isn't easy. The game runs, I no longer have to wait ages (har har) and spend hours troubleshooting server connections to play a single multiplayer game with my brother in the other room. Steam makes this all incredibly easy and relatively smooth. The developers even added a version of the modern A-move (though here it's a tab-move, and not totally reliable).  RTS is easily my favorite genre of game, and I'm a huge fan of StarCraft II. But in a time where RTS games are few and far between, and often require fast reaction times that make it difficult for casual players, it's great to have a familiar LAN-party favorite back. Cheers to the developers that made this possible, and here's to many years more of great RTS."
"After being forced onto Steam to learn how to play games by my game-crazy boyfriend, I found that this is the only game I can so far sit and play several hours playing without getting immensly frustrated and turning it off.  Thoroughly enjoyable."
A huge improvment over the original age of empires 2. The fact that it is in HD makes the experience all the more enjoyable. I also love the 2 new expansion sets that they released. One of the best parts is that you are able to mod the game to make the experience more enjoyable!
Old classic RTS fun! I highly recommend it.
i have no memory of this game
"This game is pretty dope. Played it quite a bit many years ago, glad to be able to play it again. The graphics hurt my brain and the combat lasts forever, but overall it's pretty fun."
"Bought this because i looked for a HD remake. Im not dissapointed! Very nostalgic for me, its never getting old. I hope there will be a HD remake of the first AoE on Steam soon!"
"Had non-steam version, one of the most enjoyable game I've played. More factions, larger population cap, better graphics. "
"Just a must have classic, if you are a fan of oldschool strategic games."
Probably the greatest Game made. well worth all the days you'll spend playing.
"As a long time player of AOE II ( played over 10 years ago when it was on  Zone.com)  I am super dissapointed with the new African Kingdoms expansion / patch. First time having a game update with a huge patch that i had to download just to find out it cost an additional 10$. I'll always think AOE is a great RTS game but having to pay extra 10$, for pretty much what other games would update for free to keep their fanbase playing, is bull."
Wololo my friends. Wololo.
"Still the gold standard for real-time strategy games more than 15 years after its release, Age of Empires 2 didn't age  that  well. 'HD' in this case quite literally means that the game supports higher resolutions and has crisper details: don't expect a complete overhaul. Sure, the AI was improved, and there are a few new civilizations to choose from (if you buy the DLC), but ultimately, the game plays and feels like it's 1999.  That doesn't mean that it's bad: quite the opposite, in fact. I really like playing this game with friends. But once you take off the nostalgia goggles, you realize that the game's shortcomings means there are substantially better and more modern RTS games out there.  The pathfinding is atrocious, the base management and economic development are unnecessarily cumbersome, the civilizations are not diverse enough, the single-player campaign is uninspired, and the dated combat system favours sending large swarms of junk units and early rushes over careful planning and execution.  In many, many ways,  Age of Empires 3 , which was released in 2005, is more modern and fun than Age of Empires 2, and isn't in need of an 'HD' remake. Hardcore RTS fans might've snubbed AoE 3 back in the days because they felt like the gameplay was 'dumbed down' compared to that of AoE 2, but the fact is that sometimes, less is more. Especially when it's done right.  But since all your friends are nostalgic 90's kids, you might as well grab this one when it's on sale. Otherwise, I know this is an unpopular opinion, but you should really stick to Age of Empires 3."
The first video game that I fell in love with.  Our love is forever.
"Age of Empires.... only downloaded it cause i was running a LAN party with mates and needed a cheap game everyones PC could run and download quick, turns out Age of Empires is better than expected.  I would definitly reccomend to anyone, fun with friends and easy to learn!!!"
LOVE this Game!!!!!!!!!
"Seriously, who can go wrong with an Age of Empires game... NO ONE! that's who. From the first to the last version, this game never gets boring. Build it, challenge it...destroy it! Enough said."
"Very good game. I remember playing it when I was a kid and I have spent many very happy hours enjoying the strategic superb storyline; very easy and I completely recommend anyone to play it, truly one of the easiest games out there. One massive thumbs up!"
Classic RTS
A classic that still holds true to the RTS genre. If you've ever played the AoE series or other RTS i recommend this wholeheartedly. Plus you get to make sure the Aztecs beat those damn Spanish.
"Love this game, wish they would fix the zoom, though."
"Managed to get finally into a ranked match , got to castle age and lost , never played ranked again. 10/10"
Just like the good old days but easier to use multiplayer
Great Game :)
"Age of Empires 2 is a fun and informative RTS game first relesed 1999 but has since then had multiple new expansions. The campaigns is my favorite aspect of the game and I can always return and replay the campaigns. The game itself is good and you can spend several hours playing online or against the AI, but after a time it gets a bit repetitive.  Game gets a score of 7,75/10 from me. It deserves a + for having multiplayer  Story 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Replayability 6/10 Production Quality 9/10"
Wow! I Used To Play This As A Really Young Child And Probably The First Or One Of The First PC Games I Played!! Endless Hours Of Fun And Will Always Be A Favorite!
"My favorite game of all time. Not much too say that hasn't already been said of this game. I have been playing it since about the time of its original release. Never get bored playing. I recommend this game not just to fans of RTS games, but anyone.  I give it a 20/10"
11/10 would wolo again.
Alot of old school RTS bliss.
"Best of the oldies Online game sucks, though..."
So nice stragedy game     10/10 
"A very old school classic game, still fun even now to play. I am yet to try out the new Dlc, but i find it amazing how even after all these years they have managed to release new Dlc's for. This is a game that will never die old, even if they re did the entire game in a new engine it would feel the same. I recommend this game if your into strategy and combat!"
classic game 10/10
Worst anime ever
Super fun classic RTS game! I reccomend for everyone!  But these are cons for me -Matches can be time consuming; the more players the more time and bigger the map the more time it takes  pretty much the only con; but war elephants are unstoppable in a big group 
its been ages since i played this game. still love it. really fun just to kill time with
"  Been playing this masterpiece of a game since i was 7 (Now turning 24 this year). My Step-dad got me into this game and i fell in love with it ever since. The moment i heard that a HD re-release of the gamre was coming out, It had to be a day one purchase for me. This game teaches you so much and its so much fun. it teaches how to manage your resources, multitask, communcating with others (Teamwork) and it teaches you about the history behind each of the civilizations as well. I highly recommed this for anyone who is trying to get into RTS (Real-Time Strategy for those who don't know), because its a great starting point."
Wololo ! Quit touching me ! Start the game already !
"What is there left to say? It's a HD remake of a classic RTS which will entertain gamers forever. Great new workshop contents await you. Tons of new textures, maps, looks that enhance original AoE experiance. I'm not a nerd that compete online but me and my girlfriend can't stand a week without a couple of skirmishes for some time now."
"This is game is good, but the developer support makes it so I cannot recommend this game. When you try to restore a game it automatically goes out of sync, making you unable to do so. If you plan on playing with friends, don't get this game."
It was k?
Lan not working at all.
"I grew up on Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, which uses the same game engine as AoEII. I have put countless hours into SW:GB, and I aim to do the same with this awesome game as well.  If you've played Battlegrounds prior to this, you'll have little difficulty jumping in. The only major difference is the lack of units that base their existence on aerial/anti-aerial combat, but this isn't a problem for me at all. It plays almost exactly the same; collect resources with villagers, build and fortify your base, research tech, and knock out your opponent's bases with maxed-out armies. For more excitement, play the campaigns.  10/10, do not regret this purchase one bit. Although I do wish I had waited to buy the DLC on sale, rather than full-price."
Priests shall convert all your elephants your walls mean nothing your rams mean nothing your towers mean nothing all that matters is the alpacas are with us and furious the monkey boy rules all the end of my stupidity
This is my top favorite game of all time. I can't say about it what hasn't already been said. It is simply fantastic.
"A strategy game classic, made better with an improved AI system and cool HD graphics. If you love good strategy games, this is as good as they can come. 10/10"
No words to describe such a wonderful game. I am fan of age of empire series ( especially this one ) since my childhood.
"This is a classic game, and the new scenarios are really interesting as far as story goes, and also have fun maps and units to use."
Real classic!!!! You can not get wrong with that game.
RTS as a genre decided to euthanise itself a few years after the original release of this game.  Can't top it!  
"It's an old game. Reworking the graphics in HD doesn't change the fact that it's an old game. It is sadly missing some of the major RTS improvements that came out immediately after its release (mostly in Starcraft), like Attack-Move, but on the other hand, it has some mechanics that were not only missing in Starcraft but in the entire generation of RTS which followed Starcraft, appearing only in Starcraft II and its ilk many years later, like different unit-types dealing increased or decreased damage to other unit-types (polearms do extra damage to cavalry, but are weak against infantry). On the other hand, this was one of the most fun, and most uniquely fun, RTS ever made. The real jem of this game is the ability to build fortifications and attack/defend them, which makes great use of the aforementioned mechanic of varying damage for unit-types. Units not designed to attack buildings (like infantry, or archers) deal such miniscule damage to walls and castles that it is virtually useless to attack such structures with them. Likewise, catapults, canons, and trebuchets are useless against units but devastating against structures, requiring the player to vary their forces in order to be successful. The AI (while inferior to that of Starcraft which closely followed it) is quite good, with multiple 'personalities' and strategies to battle against. I love picking maps with defensible terrain and playing against multiple, overwhelmingly numerous AI opponents, building detailed in-depth fortifications and spending hours defending them with networks of castles and towers, using rapid-response teams to sortie out and destroy attacking siege weapons while building my own invasion forces to decimate the enemy's fortifications and cities piece by piece."
"This is easily one of the best games out there, and the fact that its still as fun as ever is a testimony to the brilliance of game making.   My only real critisim is that they dared to put 'HD' in the title. What's HD? The buttons? The mouse? Nope. Looks just like it did when it first came out (trust me, i know, i played the original a whole bunch before getting this).  In fact the only thing better as far as i can tell is the matchmaking system. FINALLY you can find a game without having to download external 3rd party software. Urgh that was a pain.  8.5/10 - Not enough new features to warrant getting this if you already have the original (unless you want to pay $20 for the matchmaking), but a must have if you dont. trust me."
Gotta get those achievements.  10/10 Never gets old. But I do; too good to be true.
"Cult classic from 1999. Still fun, refreshing, active community and modding, great at LAN parties. Tried other RTS games, they failed as they were thrown to the ground. Wololo!"
Best RTS until today!
"There is a little bit of lag during onliine play... Scratch that, there's A LOT of lag during online play. Other than that I have no qualms with this game, sp is pretty fun too, just not difficult enough.  UPDATE: Most of my qualms have subsided since the last few updates including the increased difficulty (greatly increased if you so dare) and also better server latency and all around more fun :)"
"Age of Empires 2: HD is truly a great restoration. If you have ever played the Age of Empires games and are looking for some nostalgia, then this is a must buy. I won't review the actual game mechanics as the game has been out for some time, but other than what the original was like, there are some balancing changes to civilization bonuses. The only downside to this version of the game is the amount of bugs on startup and trying to run the game.  Other than that; Age of Empires is one of the best strategy games of all time 10/10"

"Really good, upgraded AI, resolution support and easy online play. Awesome."
"Standard maps work brilliantly, either as single player or online. Scenario maps, however, keep losing synchronisity."
"Absolute ♥♥♥♥ game, buggy as all Hell, and the devs dont even fix the bugs because all they care about is $$$$$ do NOT waste your money on this 'High-Def' game. and the problem im having where it wont launch anymore even though, i've checked everything, this problem is being had by other people as well"
Best game of my childhood! Brings back great memories!
"Multiplayer is buggy, Google it. You can't restore a save game as you always get a Steam server error (busy or out of sync). Tried all the fixes like verifying game file integrity but no go. This means my friends and I have to run one-time long games. I'd avoid buying until they fix this."
"Instead of reviewing let me tell you a story like one review already did.  Me and my friend allied as the Spanish and went against a british AI on the Map Water Wars ((Custom Map on the workshop)) and we were making our resources stable and researched all needed technology and aged all the way to the Imperial Age under two hours....Then it all came down...The British attacked my friend out of no where and his navy couldn't fight it, The Brits luckily backed out and left but attacked my trade ships and destroyed them so I was losing gold, luckily I was able to build my navy to about 80 Galleons and the British came shortly after and I took out half their fleet but the rest of my fleet got wiped out in the process and then they began to take down my village....Almost all my buildings were wiped out when suddenly my friend came in with a huge ♥♥♥♥ing fleet of Galleons and wiped the rest of the British out.  Later we created a huge strike force in Transport ships and launched an attack on the British island....He didn't stand a chance and half his village burnt down and we destroyed his soldiers and he surrended right at 4 hours of playtime.  10/10 please buy this game if you have friends."
Theres a reason this game is still played so many years later. Its a classic.
"This is going to be quite a long review. The TL;DR will be at the bottom.  When I was about 7 or 8 years old, I found this game (the origonal disc copy, no expansions) in my parents old PC games collection. My father helped me install it on the family PC, and let me played it. I quickly loved this game for it's strategy and medievel theme. (I still sucked at it though, I was only 7-8.)  Now here I am today playing this re-release. I can still say I love this game. This HD remake captures the feel of the origonal. It also stuffs in so much more! You get the Conquors expansion included with the game, and the option to buy very well done expansion made currently.  Everything you need to know that the game includes is in the steam video. Anything I say praising this game is redudent. (except gamemodes and map types, there are so many of those. It's spectacular!)  Buy this game if you are an AoE fan. Buy this game if you are a RTS fan. Buy this game because it is awesome.  TL;DR: It stands the test of time and it is still great. More mechanics included. Buy it now."
"Roses are Red, Your army is big, Wololo  My army"
Just Get It!  You Won't Be Disappointed!
"One of the greatest strategy games of our time; it will continue to provide challenging scenarios and hours of entertainment, many years after it's original release."
"I loved this game when I first played it all those years ago. Still love it now. Addictive Gameplay, and an RTS Style that you simply cannot find in anything anymore. It even beats out most Civilization games in my opinion. If you have never played this game, and you love RTS genre games, this NEEDS to be in your library. The dev team also did a FANTASTIC job coming out with new expansions for this old game that blends seemlessly together. Call it bias, call it nostalgia, this is one of the best games that has ever existed."
Best RTS without a doubt! Played for hundred of hours back in the good ol' days :) Now finaly here!
"When I thought back on Age of Empires II, I always blamed nostalgia for making it seem so awesome. Now I know just how an amazing game it actually is. Although the Easiest mode really is easy, the AI won't even attack you. This game is definitely worth your buck, and an absolute steal on a sale."
The best game of the series Age of Empires.
Suddenly cannot play. Starting a standard game it is stuck on 'waiting for players' and then never loads the game.
I have played this game since about 2001 and it is my favorite game ever. I really love the game because even 15 years later i am still learning new things about the game It is a lot of fun to play. it is a big game of rock paper scissors and there are probably 100 plus different counters that need to be thought about.  this game is not for everyone but i highly reccommend it
"So glad to see this game on Steam. It's one of the first games I remember playing as a young teen that really got me hooked on gaming. (not to mention all the valuable history. I was probably the only 12 year old that knew what a trebeuchet was).   The game and the graphics may seem dull to those used to playing next gen games, but the simple and addicting gameplay is what keeps me coming back. Easy to learn, and fun to perfect, this is one of the gold standards of RTS games."
"Great game great redone edition. New fans and old will really enjoy this. Workshop minimods can be a nice addition to the game that don't take it far from the core of the game. You get pretty much everything you would want out of an HD release here.  However the state of this game during its steam launch was beyond shameful and poor and not something I will forget. Insane lag and game crashing affected many and ruined the expeirence for some of my friends first time to the aoe2 and had them not wanting to give it another try.  This comes full circle again at the time of writing this with the random crashes the African Kingdoms Expansion has brought about. Two bad launches in a row is very shameful. The DLC however has good content but until the kinks get worn out you can't fully enjoy the content.  I also want to say charging for the forgoten dlc is unethical but that's a whole other topic.   Good game, bad launch history on steam."
Has to be one of the best god damn games i have ever played :3 1. Easy to learn. 2. fun to play. 3. and you acculy get to lear stuff about the civilizations you can play as. :D
"Just as I rememeber it! Classic and prob the best RTS i've ever played. Addictive, fun and easy to play but also a challenge it has the perfect mix and makes you come back for more. Must have played for 1000s of hours when i was younger!"
Spam '30' on lobby Spam '11' when enemy failed to raid
Its a great game to play with friends.:)
Why isn't the first Age of Empires not obtainable in the steam store?!?! That would make playing the franchise even more enjoyable just having all the games with thier expansions!
It's a great game. Always fun. I wish they made it compatible for mac too.
You can´t play a multiplayer game with this lag
"Best RTS of the decade. Nothing more to say, it's very recomended."
Play it and love it. Age of empires is life. WOLOLO
"Amazing. Nothing makes me happier than rehashing 1998 with a computer and internet that is 100x faster (and everyone else, too).  Seriously, though. Bring back the isometric 2D RTS games!"
"AoE II was one of my favorite strategy games to play as a kid. Sure I didn't really understant what exactly was happing at the time, it was awesome to relive those memories now that I now came across it again on steam. It's challenging, fun, and I dont believe it will ever get old. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is new to strategy games or even those who are more experienced. Double thumbs up"
"Best, Forever the Best. Love it so much. :) you should buy even if it's a old game. it has big community"
The classic RTS game and units k.o. the moment they are converted 4/5. The DLC content still needs some working though
Best strategy game ever but now on HD !
"since this game have bugs in many month and still not fixed, I suggest buy this game when listed on sale or midweek madness.  single player not affected at all (except on map overscrolling by mouse or d-pad), but probably affected at multiplayer mode (desync). just grab the essential ones with no DLC if you only want some recreations with the storyline.  7.5/10 would recommend this."
"This game is a classic. I have been playing this since i had the free demo at 9 years old. im old as ♥♥♥♥ now and still have friends who play this game. the 'HD' this game offers is a lie, it looks no different to me, but steam offers an affordable, flexible foundation to for starting games. My only gripe is that my last game crashed, as I was playing against my lifetime rival. As i was finally destroying him, the game crashed and the restore point never synced. As long as your 3+hour game doseent crash, this is the most fun you will ever have."
"This piece of art reminds me of the good old days playing the original Age of Empires 2 on my old computer. They added new campaigns, new civilizations and fixed most bugs, even though there are still a few left (especially performance issues from time to time) - but it doesn't affect you in any way. 10/10 would buy again."
"AOE was one of my all time favorite games when I was young. Its fantastic to see it on steam! Game works great, no problems on my end! =D"
I played this game when it first came out however my disk broke and I haven't been able to play it since. When I saw this I was delighted and when I played it i realised the only changes that had been made were very good ones. This is an incredible game.
awesome way better than the first and the second i love the main character stories you chose from. i would give this a 4 out of 5. game can get rediculously hard tho.
It is good.
ever since my first computer i got at the age of 3 i played this when it was introduced to me. Now that i am able to play it again brings a lot of memories back. El Cid!
good old classic :)
"Absolutely one of the iconic RTS that defined a genre that spawned everyone's favorite real-time strategy today.   A brilliantly updated and much optimized gameplay, with a population limit now up to 500 if you so choose. No more small group grabs of only 25 units at a time, updated to include MUCH larger armies (probably more like 100 now). Proper lobby system that works. Matchmaking tracked and ranked play included from minute 0, so if you enjoy that, you can hop right in.   The real world maps are included, and the AI seems very improved, but it still has its issues, and human competition is still my favorite. Great to pick up and play with a group of friends that used to play together or for some nostalgic Hun v Goth steppe battles.   I haven't even had a chance to properly sink my teeth into the base HD content, but it is quite worth a pickup at 60+ hours into the game. I have spent countless hours over the years playing my old Ensemble Studios version of the original Age 2, and this is a near flawless version of that. Graphically it isn't obviously up to modern day standards, but for what it is, I would rate this a 9.7/10 on the GunF0x scale of games.  I look forward to finishing at very least all the campaigns included on every difficulty before I pick up 'The Forgotten' DLC but that again, looks like a wonderful addition to a classic game. Ensemble Studios lives on forever in our hearts...but is never forgotten! :)"
"I orginally played this game when I was 7/8 and I haven't played it for years since. Then I saw it on steam and nearly cried, childhood feeling came back. Fricken love and it is still amazing. Totally buy it guys and gals!"
"Age of Empires 2 was the first game i ever played. And despite a lack of real improvement in the Hd edition, the game still holds up very well.  The game is a without a doubt up there with the best PC games ever made.  10//10"
"If game scores were based off logic, this would have a score of zero  Nonetheless, they aren't so this scores 10/10"
"This game has a lot of nostalgia for me, so I might be a little biased when it comes to this game, but I still think it is WELL worth the time!"
"A classic. The game lacks some features that would be expected of a modern game (such as camera zoom and rotation), but that is no surprise. The HD release does add some stuff (spectator mode, a lobby), but the most important thing is it brings back some official support, so we can keep expecting improvements now.  Note: the multiplayer has always been and remains broken, with unexpected and irrecoverable player drops..."
8/8 M8 Can zerg rush with suicide bombers.
this game will lasts forever and ever.
great game :^)
unplayable to laggy when maps are fully revealed and when there are alot of AIs and thing happening i wish i could return it but its to late now. i love this game always been a favorite but i can play it with the lag whatsoever. ill just go back to playing the non-HD version with the expansions.
I have come to know age of empires most of my life. This HD version revived the game for me. The steam support is exactly what makes it fun
"Multiplayer doesn't seem to work. Freezes after a half hour or hour. Then a window comes up pretending to let players continue, and resigns players making game unplayable. VERY UPSET that I just spent money to play this game with my buddy and it doesn't work."
Looks exactly like the original. 10/10
If you've play Age of Empires before you know how good it is (this game was my childhood man) and this game is no exception. Fully reccomend.
Fun as heck! Enjoy amassing an army with friends and going into battle and slaughtering your enemeys! SHOW NO MERCY!
STILL WATING ON A RESPONSE FROM STEAM ON HOW TO FIX THIS GREAT GAME!!!! EVER SINCE UPDATE 4.2 THE GAME WILL NOT OPEN BEING STUCK ON A 'VALIDATING SUBSCRIPTION' SCREEN   F-U STEAM!!!!!!
you can convert a catapualt to christianity and set a building on fire by slashing swords at it.  leems segit
300 Hours and I still haven't done the campaign.
"Classic revitalized into high definition. If you enjoy medievil era 'real time strategy' games and haven't played any of the Age of Empires series, then this here title is for you."
Old but gold. One of the best RTS ever. They don't make games like that anymore.
"It brings you back to the good ol' days ...almost. They were lazy with this remake, they basically just made it pretty but did little to actually make the game any better. If its cheap and you loved the old game then grab this one."
"Easily one of my favorite games of all time. If you like RTS games, this is the grandfather of them all. I love this game"
I think I had an erection the full time I played this... Seeking medical aid 
A re-mastered classic.
"Friends: 'Hey, wanna play Ages of Empires II?!' Me: 'Ah, don't you mean you want to play Chop Wood Simulator?'"
It's simple. It's fun as hell. Looks a lot better than the old disc version. SO GOOD BUY IT!
Enemy team:  About 57 Sword men 71 Archers  War elefants everywhere (About 11) Ships surrounding my island.  My Team: 6 Settlers 3 Archers 1 Transport ship  I made it to another Island and started again  11/10 would start again. 
Developers are purely amazing. They continue to develop great new content!  But what makes this game the best is the community. All the custom map makers are always churning out new maps that are incredible to play. You have to Buy this game!
"I find this game makes me think more until i am like a little genius, this is an excellent game worth playing and alot of fun and the great thing it does not need a great graphics card"
After all this time? -Always.
It's like being 10 again but actually knowing what you're doing this time around. Definate purchase.
"Absolute classic enhanced enough to be playable 16 years after it's first release, totally amazed that we have Steam workshop mods for it as well."
I had the disc version from years back. Great game. Thought I'll play again for oldtimes sake.
It's okay. You can draw the groundwork Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon so yeah.
"Online gameplay is terrible. Takes forever to join a match, and it's super laggy, even on a T-1 line connection."
best classic game ever
"if you have age of empires 3 or like real time strategy (RTS) games, you should get this! Fun game! 8.5/10"
What a ♥♥♥♥ing classic. Highly recommended.
"Still the best RTS game out there. The HD rework breathes new life into this classic, and the new expansions bring even more civilizations to the table along with new single player campaigns, maps, and game modes. Hours and hours of content in single player, and a competetive multi-player scene with a ranking system for those like myself who want to improve their gameplay/ strategy.  Single player Content- 9 Multi-player Gameplay- 8 (can be laggy) Nostalgia- 10"
Nice Game ! A little bit too expensive though...
"I haven't found anything to hate about AoE II, aside from some connectivity issues and the high price. It plays as good, and even better, than many modern RTS games. If you liked before, you will still like it."
a classic that will never die.
This is the best game
One of the best RTS that ever came out. The original died due to crappy server interface and you had to use 3rd party software servers to play making it a hassle and the default resolutions quickly became dated. With the new servers and graphic updates the game is growing bigger then ever.  Top 5 rts games on my list for sure.
This game if in one word amazing not always historically accurate but never the less is an amazing RTS and Strategy game its worth the money and could convince those that aren't too fond of this game type to think differently.
Highly recommend this game!
"Great update on the old version, though there are a few issues that could be my pc and type of play."
10/10
"The Grandfather of RTS. lLaying this years later, I still love this game.   Though I disagree with the price, it being so old a game."
Favorite game when I was a kid. Dont have many hours on steam but its a great game that I've logged at least a thousand hours before steam was even an idea. Great game for kids or for people just starting to game.
Faster paced when compared to other games of its type such as Civilization. I recall being very addicted to this during its original release.
"Very nice game, just like the classic game, but even better!"
"Hands down, without a doubt, one of the best games ever made for a computer. I spent at least half of my childhood playing this game on a old rust-bucket, and the other half going to school and sleeping. This is probably, in my opinion the best AoE that was ever made. This HD remake of this old classic made me so happy when it first came out.   Definitly buy it if you are thinking about it. It's so great..."
"Bought this game right when it came out as I loved the previous version even including the Forgotten mod. With updates, balance patches, quality of life fixes and DLC now and incoming DLC. Still my Favorite game all time."
"10/10 I've always really enjoyed the Age of Empires series, Age of Mythology, and Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds. I just like that type of game. (No one reccomend Star Craft to me, I've already played it) This is basically an Age of Empires game with better graphics, more content and Multiplayer that actually works. I would buy again and would reccomend for anyone who likes any of the games listed above."
Very fun game. Lots of stuff to do.
"Almost 20 years old, still play.  The remake could be better, though..."
10/10 would win only with monks and have large amounts of lag again   pls fix the lag
"Playing older computer games on newer systems can be a challenge. But Age of Empires II HD does it perfectly. The game runs smoothly, the textures are crisp, and it runs in full widescreen. Thanks to the developers for bringing my first computer game into the modern era!"
"I'm a big fan of Age of Empires and have been faithful for several years. Such a shame that the original company Ensemble Studios folded in 2009. This is probably the best of the series. Age of Empires 1 was a little too slow for my liking and there no learning curve for the game. You were expected to know everything before you played. And Age of Empires 3 just lacked the spark that this game had. And now we have a HD remake, things just get better and better. New DLC that we haven't seen before and all the bad things that were in the original are now gone. PLUS multiplayer!! One thing I will say against it though is this game is very unforgiving for new players. It's MUCH more difficult than the original so personally I would reccomend Age of Empires 3 to start if you want to stay in the franchise. I really couldn't reccomend any other game to you because this and Starcraft are the kings or RTS. If you're looking for a fast paced action packed fun game that does have some learning needed then this is the game for you. 9.5/10 - Whilst this is a much beter version than the original it has lost a little of the magic of the original. That being said this fixes all the stuff wrong with the original but changes a few things. Like the UI is different from the original and just a few things here and there. With that being said, it's a wonderful RTS that is perfect for anyone looking for something to replace Starcraft 2 for a while."
Brings back lots of memories from the past.   Very glad I bought this game :))  
this game so cash
Very fun to play with your mates.
The HD version has changed little to the game however it is definatly worth playing if you used to enjoy the game. They have made it much much easer to play multiplayer and the game lobbys actually work.
One of the best RTS games I have ever played. So much fun.  - 10/10.
"+ remake of very good RTS + appreciable addons (which should be done long time ago in classic AoE II)  - its HD in time of 4k - laggy - very laggy - lags are annoying - wait - oh.. Laggy! - over 10 years old game, just remade to HD and on present PCs it is LAGGING!!! - Lags - last con - I dont know if click recommend or not.. But I will click 'NO'.. this price, such old game, laggy!"
"This is an old game. The price is that of a new game. Wait for a sale, then it is worth it."
awesome game. mods are epic and this is a classic RTS IMO
"Destroying friendships since 1999, but now in HD.  Wololo!/10"
Wololo
Still the best strategy game.
I have been brought up on this game. I've based my life on it.
Brings back good memories.
Great classic that brings back memories of being younger!
"I have kinda mixed up feelings with this release. Don't get me wrong, if you intend to only play single player then buy this but otherwise you should think twice about it.  The original HD release was a buggy mess, barely playable online and it took the devs over a year to fix the worst out of sync and lag problems. The game was playable, actually I'd say even decent, compared to other alternative online platforms such as Voobly but on the day of darkeness 17.6.2015 the developers managed to break the online feutures once more with a patch, 4.0. They've tried to fix it but noooo, it still sucks big time.  tl;dr: Age of Empires 2 HD is the biggest fars of HD re-releases. SP is great, MP is just awful."
I love this Game And I basically grow up in when I was younger kid and when I knew I went crazy 10/10
one of my favorite RTS games. Visual upgrades aren't amazing or anything but this is still a good pickup. Price point might be a bit high so maybe wait for a sale.
if you like statagy this is for you 
MAN this game is fun.. all the 'Civs you can be and the maps are so fun... the only thing that sucks is that if one person lags... everyone else lags... the game is even better with 'The Forgotten Expansion Pack
a fun game with loads of new features and a thrive community loads to explore and play in this map idk how its survived fopr abou 15 years god ! 
Berries. That is all you need to know
"Awesome game, enough said!!!"
Wololo
"this game is my childhood, i know i was born on the year that the dlc came out :3 but still when i was 3 me and my brother got the frist computer (he was 6) and i watched him play gta san andress lol wtf with that generation, that when i played, i always liked to play rts games like warcraft 3, age of empire 2 or even age of mythology, (i had them on my computer i dont know how). By the way i am not american so yeah i didnt know that much english :3 the funny thing i learnd english from video games. but my fav thing to do on age of empire go to the map editor and create my own army and my rival army, and that still fun thing to do, but now i know how to read that things and how use the terrian and things like that and it more fun when its hd so yeah buy it, i think i got it on bundle but i am not sure i dont remmber -_- stupid me"
"A faithful remastering of the classic game, Age of Empires II gives the player a deeply complex but easy to learn strategy game that guarantees hours of fun. I would recommend this game to any fan of the AoE franchise or a fan of strategy games in general."
IT'S BACK! This game along with Warcraft II and Starcraft DEFINED my childhood.
A classic RTS that any RTS fan will love.
I've played it short and do not regret a minute.
"Have you ever felt like going up to your boss and CRUSHING HIS SCULL UNDER FOOT but without ending up in jail? Feer no more! For with Age of Emires HD EDITION you can not only crush his scull, but you can crush his morral/self confidence/life/ect. Have fun! "
10/10   This game is my childhood
"Best AoE and one of best strategick games... +HD,steamworkshop,Steam connection"
Played when i was young. Thanks for keeping this game going strong.
"This game aged real good, still as great as it used to be"
"So like, been ages since I got Age of Empires again. I have a cracked version but its boring without the expansion and multiplayer after a point. So the sale is on and its for 3 dollars?? DAMN. Call my friends up, ask em to buy, they buy. Next morning, woke up, played a match with a freind of mine for 2 hours and like, i was being owned the entire match. I literally made my last unit run around in circles to avoid the 100 troops he had.... should have not made the map an island.  So yeah, damn good game, good memories, music isn't great though."
problem with multiplayer
Good game with funny memes.
"I actually prefer the original; the graphics don't seem that much better, and the UI is much smaller. Worst of all, the options menu doesn't have any of the good options added in later games (default combat stance, specifically). It's okay, but if you have the old version and have no friends to play it with anyway, don't get it. Otherwise you could buy it on sale. It's really not worth the full price."
the only game i keep going back to 
"First strategy game I ever played was actually AOE 1, not 2. I can't seem to find AOE 1, unfortunately. AOE 2 is also good, I bought it for 2.99 about two months ago because it was on 85% sale. Worth every single penny."
"This is an RTS classic, and the fact that it’s been integrated into Steam makes it even better. If you’re a fan of the Age of Empire’s series then why don't you own this already? If Age of Empires is new to you thwn picking up this game is like picking up a realic, it may not generate gold for you, but you do get to see one of the foundational RTS games."
Probably the best PC game ever made
11/10
Fantastic game! Played it on and off since i was a little kid. 
"Great classic. It's the same game that I played sixteen years ago, except now it's natively compatible with HD screens. The AI is DEFINTELY better than before, and the game is still being updated and optimized. Haven't tried multiplayer yet. Worth every penny!"
Love it
"Started playing this game when I was six and i still love playing it, i think that's shows how enjoyable it is. I don't have many hours because i used to play the disc version which wasn't HD, sadly."
beat the vikings with Mayans in Texas. Flawless Logic.
Finally can play onlline again. This game was already amazing and this just makes it even better 9/10  Full review -  https://gamerfergy.wordpress.com/2015/08/12/my-accidental-favourite-unexpected-treasure/ 
"I still own the original CDs for AOE2 and the expansion, Conquerors. Bought it back in 2000 when I was a freshman in HS. Great game and now with HD version, I can relive those great times with friends now. One of the best RTS games out there. Buy it and play it."
"Honestly I love it. Great game, ver since a little kid I loved rts games and this really set the standard for alot of them. I plan on paying this games as much as I did when I was little. It may be the nostalgia but I love it!"
"Grew up playing this game and somehow lost my disk about 10 years ago. Thankfully some smart person Thought 'Hey, let's bring back AOE2 and Remaster it'  To whoever had the idea to remake it: 'THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK MY CHILDHOOD. Also..... WOOLLOOLOOO'  10/10"
10/10
Vary fun game to play
My favorite RTS of all time. So glad to have it on steam and being updated. They have done a lot to improve it. So if you have't played in a long time and you loved it back in the day. It is even better now.
Feels just like glorious childhood and more :')
"This game is awesome, i palyed it from my childood and everything is perfect about it"
HD could have been done better but its still good.
"Fun,more fun and even more. Great hd remake 10/10. This game will live for the years to come a great stratedy game for all &lt;EVEN YOU&gt;"
.
This game is fun. Thats all.
"Amazing game, absolutely timeless,"
Best RTS ever created.
This game is the modernisation of AOE 2 from my childhood. Its every bit as good except it doesn't enjoy the same large following it once had.
Pros: -The classic Age of Empires II + its expansion -Improved graphics and AI -New game modes -Retains the vibe of the original game  Cons(EDITED 30/11/2014): -Nothing currently.
This Is A Great Game!
"Not a game I would play by myself too much, but playing with friends is a lot of fun. I've definitely spent a good number of hours on this game trying to build the best agriculturally place and loading up some allies with the means for attack! Though invading myself now and then is always fun :)  The art is okay, some more modern games probably do better now but this seems to be a game that you could abandon for a year or two and then want to replay over and over."
A classic restored to life.
King scouts better than the scout  10/10 realism - IGN
As fun rediscovering the game now as playing is when I was a kid. Definetly worth the money!  9/10
Must I stress the brilliance that is Age of Empires?
One of the best PC games that will ever exist with a great historical accuracy (how do you turn this on)
LOVE this game... XD one of the classic games of the 90s! beautiful and challenging to this day and still plenty of players on to test your might against..... :/ if u got the BALLS! would recommend to entire steam community.
Had the originals when they came out. Nice to have it again. Fun with friends and family online. The campaigns are classic.
"I loved this game, it's simplistic so anyone can join in the fun after learning a bit of what beats what. It's not like Empire Earth which is more strategy oriented, this game goes on a faster pace than most. I recommend this game, gotta love the clasics."
"Just like I remember from its first release. Now that it's remasterd AOE II looks better on 64-bit computers. I will add that the multiplayer is easier to connect and join games.   The fact that you can play other players maps and take on their challenges is a plus. Along with a new Expansion pack this game is giving a breath of fresh air.   All in all rather your a life long fan or looking for a new RTS game, AOE II HD is worth buying."
Greatest game of all time! and it got even greater by being on steam.
"What's not to like it? Remember when you were a Kid staying up late playing this game? Yeah, back to it, love the classic! :D"
"The game of my childhood. It may not have aged that well, but in my view this will always be a classic strategy game."
"If you want to play this for the singleplayer and have a overlay. Then buy it cheap ( well since you've already got it on CD somewhere ) . But i woud'nt buy this for the multiplayer , its laggy and THERE IS NO LAN . Seriously put in LAN back in"
"This game is a classic RTS. It's simple, but to play well, you need to really think about where, when, what to build. The campaigns arer huge fun and teach you nicely about different parts of history. The Forgotten civilizations are fun, but the campaigns on that part are somhow lacking. Possibly the lack of a voiceover? In any case, still worth getting."
My Favorite Game Is Back in HD 20\10  I just spent an hour shooting horses with my friends
Great revival of an old time classic!
"As I have played the original, I definitely recommend the HD remake if you are willing to pay for the game again. I was hesitant of paying for a game I already owned and would have liked to just register a CD key and get the game on Steam but it went on a decent sale and I bought it. I was enjoying the great game play of a great game I experienced long ago and with better and new features at that. The features that I like the most is a working multiplayer and steamworkshop integration. The workshop and multiplayer really brings the community together and enjoy a classic RTS."
One of the best RTS games ever made.  Play the challenging and accurate historical campaigns or go for competitive play Online against others. The game has everything a good RTS needs.  A game that teaches history..  9/10
"nostalgica. Its still a great game but the full price is stupid. I really love the game, and that will never change. the graffics are far from hd, they have just made them compatibal for newer grafficscards."
One of the best experiences I've had in a RTS game in a while
There is a lot of stuff and things in this game. It is very fun. Rick Grimes from hit television series 'The Walking Dead' approves because of said stuff and things. 10/10 survivors would play. 10/10 predators would not.
"My very first RTS as a child, is the best RTS game ever made. Age of Empires II: Age of Kings and the Conqueror's expansion pack leave other games such as Starcraft in the dust. What a magnificent game.   10/10 I'll make sure my kids waste 100's of hours on this like I did when I was little."
"Well, Age of Empires II was one of the big classics of RTS. After the first part which played in the Antique and tought the player much about european history if he was willing to read all those history-parts in the scenario descriptions, AoE2 chose a different approach. The game now played in medieval times and the history was told by a narrator on the beginning and on the end of every scenario in the main campaigns, so that even the lazy ones got their education.  Now, what to expect on the HD-Edition? Well, of course some better graphics. If you have the original game (and 'the Conquerors'-AddOn) and don't think higher resolutions are worth the money, you might still want to buy the game to get the 'The Forgotten' DLC. It's a new set of campaigns about some historical persons who are well less known then those in the original game. For example Vladimir Tepesh, also known as Dracula (who was not a real vampire but a very bloodthirsty military leader who fought the osman Empire). And you will get some new nations to play.  So is everything well with the game? Not entirely. The developpers revised the random maps and some bugs still don't seem to be fixed. For example some AIs seem to have problems with a nomadic start which results in doing nothing at all. And the scenario intros on the 'forgotten' campaigns are not narrated as players of the original campaigns are accustomed.  Still it's AoE2 and hey - if you missed this game you can't understand the history of the RTS genre."
Great HD remake - Steam workshop for more maps plus beautiful new terrains/tile sets. Everything works. If you played it tons when it first came out you'll play it even more now.
"Awesome game that brings back a lot of good memories. Excellent upgrade, but there are big lag issues in multiplayer."
Great game if you like strategy games. Its a blast to have a big game with your firends to see everyones differnt play style's
"I. Love. This. Game. I love the updated version of this game (I have it on a disk) and if you can't tell my addiction to this game, then I don't know what to tell you."
"Anyone who is anyone claiming to be a gamer has heard of, if not spent a multitude of hours as a Mongol, or Aztec warrior defending their keep from hordes of enemies! Revisit your childhood / early adulthood with this remastered classic! 10/10 +1 Nostalgia rating!"
It's back and (with The Forgotten Expansion) even better!
It brought back a lot of memories. I personally like this HD makeover. The lack of updated textures means nothing to me as all I wanted to do was play AoE2.  
"Very good game, love it. All time classic."
"It's the classic RTS reskinned for higher resolutions. No longer do you have to reconfigure your Windows Vista/7/8 system to specifically play this gem. No longer do you have to search the internet void for multiplayer games of AoE 2. It's back with a whole new multiplayer system available. If you feel nostalgic for those good-old-bad-old days of old-school RTSs, then grab your sword, raise your shield, and charge into AoE 2 HD.  Be warned: If you're used to the old hotkeys from the original AoE2 game, you'll have to reset them all or adapt to the new hotkey system (which is functional, although it just feels weird to not hit 'b' then 'e' to build a house...)."
"An older game but still so good. There are a lot of simularities to playing Terran on StarCraftII, but with almost a higher level of complexity. The campaign is still challenging and fun to run through."
"Awesome remake, definitely worth the nostalgia"
Very fun to micro 500 units into destroying a whole civilization :3
Old RTS game that still fun. Does not need as much microing as modern RTS games and really nostalgic.
"it's not hd as it says, but good for multiplay, and retro."
Lots of fun
Kinda the same. but still playable
Game has aged gracefully. Managing resource production is enjoyable and nothing beats building a ♥♥♥♥ all huge army and obliterating your enemy
"Great Game, Great Times, Great Remake Expansions are good, Steam compatibility with Mods and workshop stuff is great.. So everything is made the way it should be. 10/10 would buy again"
My most favorite game series for a all time strat game. Don't make the map ludicrous. Giant is big enough with little to no issues. I have like two copy's of the non HD one on CD. But I been playing this game for about 5 years now.
How can I get my money back?
"It is and will always be, the best strategy game of all time!"
even the lags and multiplayer issues are like the old good times. 10/10 for the nostalgia
For my calculations i nedd to play until 2070 to finish all the achivements. Boring achivements made for this game
"For original AoE2 players, the HD version will not disappoint. Just as fun as the original, but with less eye-shredding pixelation.  For people who have not played AoE2 before, I fully recommend it. It's a classic for a reason, and the price is reasonable."
Had a very fortified city untill one villager cut a path through the woods to have a massive gap in my wall  10/10 would create this massive gap again
we need to play on a lan network so we dont lag
Play strategy games?  Buy this game.
Classic strategy game that will provide hours of fun.
Very good and very fun
Age of Empiers 2. What there is to say? Still love to play it.
"An amazing RTS With so much to learn and master, Not just good for nostalgia but this can stand on its own as well, If you are a fan of real time stratagy you will not be dissapointed"
"Awesome RTS - sure the graphics are lackluster, the AI is either really dumb or an RTS master, and sure there are some things you can't do in newer RTS games (like changing the way your army is facing with a right-click drag) - but it has everything a great RTS needs to make it a great RTS.  Tons of civs, and tons of different strategies. If you want an awesome RTS that surprisingly holds up incredibly well for its age, get AoE 2. If you want a watered/dumbed down RTS made for kids, try AoE 3 instead..."
Great game !! It's awesome to have this good classic back in the new gen of HD. The graphics are are great improvment while still respecting the AoE II visuals!  A must for LAN parties!
"Age of Empires II finally comes back to us.  After the travesty that was Age of Empires III, I am glad we got a remastered version of Age of Empires II. It still has the nostalgic look and feel, so I would recommend it for people who played it back when it first came out. However, newcomers will probably better appreciate other games with better graphics and AI."
"This game never grows old. I even prefer it to AoE III. The achievements are plenty, and though some are challenging, none are so difficult as to be unobtainable."
"Absolutely fantastic game. Nostalgia plays a role, sure, as I grew up with this, but the game is still great.  The graphics are fine, but it really isn't the reason why anyone would play Age of Empires. If you're reading this and haven't heard of or played it before, I can only tell you this: it's easy to learn, the pace is set by the players (you can go slooooow or lightning fast when developing your empire), the strategy element is wonderful (there is ALWAYS a way to beat that obnoxious friend with the 'perfect strategy') and there are tons of ways to set up your empire in a way that suits you best.  When I play AoE with my friends, you can immediately identify each of ur empires by its looks. Not just the skins of the different factions, but rather the layout of our empires.  Amazing game, well worth it. I'd pay 60 bucks for this, easy. If you like strategy games, playing with friends (or just messing around on your own) and exploding suicide monkeys, buy Age of Empires II."
"Amazing game, been playing Age of Empires since i was 2 years old and still love all the games. AoE 2 is great and much better since they re-skined it and updated it."
"All the nostalgia, loads of workshop content, depressingly quick AI and more elite longbowmen than my TIME computer could ever handle back in '02"
Its a great fun game to waste time and make ur friends hate eacher other by trolling them!
"5/5 When a 15 year old game get's it's own HD remake there's a reason for it, some times you think i'd love to play that game again I played as a child, only to find you don't enjoy it like you did back then. Not the case with AOE2, puts many modern strat games to shame. Others have tried but I don't think any have managed to make such a simple strategic game quite as well as AOE did. Still very popular online too."
After all those years!
Spent hours as a kid conquering the world and now will be fighting more civizilitons for the rest of my life. Only wish they were still makimg games like this.
Wololo
  An Age Old Game brought to Steam
"The nostalgia is heavy with this one. First RTS I ever played as a kid and still enjoy playing. A timeless classic that I hope lives on forever. Also, machine gun cobras."
Very fun if you have friends to play with.
"One of my favouite games of all time. It has aged so so well. It was fun and addicting at age 10 and still is now aged 20. Plenty of Mods, information, single player battles and fun to play with friends. Just and amazing game overall."
Love this series to bad big ugly Mircosoft blow up the dev team. Would have loved to have seen AoE 4 and 5...
super fun! I just wish it was cross platform.
"Classic RTS game from my childhood. The single player campaign is extensive, taking me all of about 90+ hours to complete. Lots of different empires to play as, all with their respective unique units and bonuses, all while being incredibly balanced to play as. The multiplayer is also lots of fun if you got some friends to play with.  My only complaints is that sometimes the AI can get a little stupid. I had one instance where and allied CPU built about 80 mining camps all over the place for no reason. Also, the multiplayer can be a pain in the butt to run smooth sometimes and it took a lot of searching to get clear answers on how to fix it.   This game aged wonderfully and while it misses a lot of bells and whistles and fancy stuff that modern RTS games have nowadays, it's still an amazing game to play."
"All the greatness i remember as a kid, while still being worth while running on a screen that isnt thicker than it is wide"
"This game holds it's own, a medieval Command and Conquer, sure there are better graphics available these days, but I still enjoy playing this today."
"It's finally fixed and thanks to SteamWorks, you can mod this puppy to look a lot more pretty."
"I loved AOE II in my youth and was looking forward to playing it again with some better res.  Don't bother buying this version, all they did is port the thing to some new OS and basicly added some resolutions, the rest is still just as the old version. Might as well play that one."
This game came out a year after I was born and already has done more than I'll ever do.  10/10 Meme Simulator 1999
Cool beans
A classic slice of strategy and fun! It's old but still so much fun to play.  7/10
awesome and classic.If you are looking for the perfect classic strategy game then play this game.
"AWesome game i love it, great classic game."
"Never had any issues with bugs in this game, so I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. Don't forget to check out the soundtrack mods because they totally change the overall feeling of battle. Having Kill la Kill's, 'Don't Lose Your Way' blasting while charging into the enemy's army is crazy fun. Not to mention playing with friends only makes the entire experience better. Even if RTS games aren't your specialty, buy this game. You'll get better with time and it only gets more fun."
"Setting fire to stone buildings and castles with swords and pikes since 1999! Now in proper resolution. One of the greatest strategy games from the days of old and a good nostalgia trip to most of us. Probably won't appeal to the younger audience but if you like RTS games in general give it a go, you might just like it."
It's aight.
"Should be the standard for all RTS's, one of the greats."
Wrecking fools
Its a classic!  Graphics are not up to date but damn the strategy is deep.
It's great if you want to play the orginal AOEII without hassle. The DLC is underwhelming and a bit of a waste of money. Aways use Original AI for random maps if you want the AI to create an acual army to fight as the new AI seems to not want to do that.
Played it for years... too bad there is no lan option.
"Third campaign of the Genghis Khan. The Mongols come to conquer China, and the Chinese are like..'We can beat the Mongols by erecting a Wonder.' And the Mongols are like..'Oh no! we are screwed."
"Whenever I see the words 'Age of Empires' plastered on a product, I usually get this sudden pain in my chest and it wont go away unless I purchase said product. This game in particular was an exception... I had nearly died of a heart attack after the photons of light that consisted of this product had hit my retina. I proceeded to fart and puke simultaneously out of sheer excitement whilst attempting to purchase this game. Once I clicked that little green button to confirm my purchase I thought that would fix my current dilemma but I was wrong. Once clicked, Steam had redirected me to my game library and there I had laid my eyes on the words 'Age of Empires 2: HD.' My brain could not comprehend the letters HD and the words Age of Empires 2 put into a single sentence so I proceeded to have a stroke and was stuck back in the vortex of my uncontrollable flatulence/vomit combination. That truly was the best day of my life."
"If you have some Fin to play with, it rocks boys .. You can get one on  www.fintze♥♥♥♥♥es.com "
It's Age of Empires II.  One of the greatest RTS games of all time. Probably don't need to say any more about it than that.
"Still one of the leading RTS games, a completely timeless game and will always have endless gameplay fun. "
"AoE 2 has always been one of my favorite RTS games. I love how now I can play it online again and with my friends through steam. I totally recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS games, especially with a group of friends."
"I am a old PC gamer and I love this game,, //weep"
"Age of Empires II is the best RTS strategy game I have ever played. The gameplay is fun and challenging, the controls are spot on, and this game has provided me with laughs I could get form almost no other game. Most of the units in the game have a strong weakness, so it is really fun to experiement with different army composition. Almost all of the civs are great fun, and the maps are generally good all around. The only major weakness is that the navy isn't that good, but with practice even galleons can be awesome. Another thing is that the multiplayer isn't that great, but that is ok. And the best part about it is, it's 15 years old! Overall I would give Age of Empires II a 9 and a half out of 10."
"An all-time classic that puts damn near every modern game to shame. Incredibly fun and pretty balanced, AOE2 is the definitive classic RTS."
teu bosen ane maen iu game... buy and enjoy the game :3
Charged 368 Aztec warriors into a Japanese town and they got slaughtered by 150 samurai and mortars. 10/10 would charge again.
First PC game i ever play now its been around 10 years and still looking forward to play some more AOE 10/10
"This game. When i was a young lad this was one of the first games i ever played. It is just as much fun now as it was back then, and now we have the workshop and what not to get new content. This is one of my favorite games of all time it just doesnt get boring its a classic, whether its the well done campaigns, or screwing around on the scenario editor there is always fun to be had."
"Age of Empires 2 is an amazing game for strategy fans. It goes like this: gather suplies to support your army,then crush your enemies with your allies or assist them when they need help.With a bunch of gamemodes to play with, its a supreme gameplay experience as you make decisions and choose between units or resources.Also, it supports not only singleplayer but multyplayer! That is big,why you ask? Well, back in the day age of empires didnt have a proper multyplayer mode.But now,it is a true masterpiece.New buildings,new units,new civilizations,new added triggers and a lot more! Another sweet feature is the map creator system with which you can create maps to even stories that you imagine,of course it will take you some time to learn the triggers and all,but thats not important for the game.Last two things are: 1)the trainong system,which teaches new players a lot of usefull information,and trust me,it does a realy good job at giving the basics, but it still cant fully give everything. 2)the steam workshop.Now i know what you are thinking:what?why is that important? Well you better read here friend becouse its huge.back to the old versions that didnt exist making age of empires a little bit boring after finishing it.But now you can play maps other people make,and some people are really talented!!try it out!  So that was a review than a recomended text but for strategy fans its amazing, while for first person shooter fans not so much.all in all,its a good game for just strategy fans,which is ok but that unfortunatly cant change as Age of Empires is meant for that. as a score i would give it a '' 9.2 / 10'' ,a great game but only for just some people.But your money is worth ok?thats for sure.anyway,if i helped to making your decision then i am happy and if have any different opinion then comment it.thats all.   "
Got torn to pieces by my friends catapults. Will use Calvary next time.
"Even after a decade this game is a master piece. I recommend it to anyone who loves RTS games. As for the hd version, it's not much of a difference except the fact that structures has been redesigned to look better. Anyway if you ask me the game is worth it and I think you should buy it."
"This game and Age of Mythology were basically my entire childhood, they were what I would be playing at most times of the day so now to be able replay a remastered edition with added elements and a workshop to be able to add to this already fantastic game, its like reliving my childhood all over again"
Favorite game of all time. Still have the original disks and I must have put a 1000 hours into AOEII as a kid. Having it on Steam with NEW content is a dream come true.
Recommended.
Yes. Do it.
"A good game, would definely recommend. looks a bit better than the original. experiencing multiplayer lag issues."
maddest game when it was around and it still is
"This HD remake, unlike HoMM3, has everything you could want. Coupled with it own expansion it is truely one for the fans and new players alike.  Would recommend"
"The graphics aren't really much better than the original but the workshop allows for better textures, rules, and custom scenarios which make it a massive improvement."
"Charging money for a 20 year old game, blatantly plagiarizing the first fan-made DLC, relying on Ozhara and other modders to supply HD textures rather than building up the game itself. This game wasn't a remake, it was a port of the old game to Steam. They should've initially priced it as such, and if they truly cared about providing a quality product they would've done so.  The game is RAMPANT with lag and desyncs. The ELO is so inaccurate because every time you DC you lose ELO. I would've been happy with getting ripped off if the ♥♥♥♥ing product worked like it's supposed to. Instead, I have to deal with problems that should've been dealt with by any competant dev team.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Play on Voobly, it's way better. Yes, I have a lot of hours in this game. No, I cannot recommend it because this is exploitation of the game I know and love. I'd be content with Microsoft milking the cow, but instead of milking it with respect and taking care of the cow they're drying up the cow's udders and feeding it garbage.   Honestly, it's sick how greedy people can be. All I ♥♥♥♥ing wanted was to play the game in peace. BUT NOOOOOOO, almost every game has to crash/desync/lag like crazy. It's not an internet issue either, I don't have this problem with other old game remakes. If you respect your time and your sanity, do not buy this game."
Reminds me of the old dayzzzz
"I like this game, very much but on multiplayer sucks. The reason is this server lag 3-4 seconds and you can't play normal."
"played it when it originally came out, loved it. got it when it came out on here, love it &lt;3"
The Arnold Schwarzenegger mod really bring this HD remake to life.. Hit somone with a ''So you want to be a Farmer... well heres a couple of acres *whip sound*'' 30minutes into a game!
I've loved this game since I was about 5 years old. I love how they didn't change the game. Everything is perfect in this game and online is fun. Nothing will change the way I feel about this game.
"Just like old time, all the great memories this game game bring"
Love it. Nice upgrade of a game that i had a lot of fun playing. Will have to give the multi-monitor a try.
excellent game... recently playing as France =D
For a HD remake you would think it would be HD looks like im still playing on the PS2
"I played this game a lot when I was a child. old memories come to mind &lt;3 I recommend to play this, because it is the best stradegia game, if you are a big fan of creating infinity stuff, this game is a good choice because you can create a realy crazy armies and destroy the enemy city."
nice you try this
"Very nice game, only the multiplayer is not that good. There are enough lobbies, but it takes ages before the game can actually start. Everyone needs to ready up and sometimes it crashes and everyone needs to ready up again. In the multiplayer games, it always laggs. So everything you do, it takes 1 or 2 seconds to load, which is very annoying in combat. But the singleplayer is very good with nice graphics."
This is a must have for base building strategy games it litteraly wrote the book and defined the word strategy.
The oldest and till date best strategy game ever !
"I was so happy when I opened this up and started playing it! It was just like I remembered only...better. The look was great, the engine works, and game play is fun and challenging. This is one of the best RTS ever and the HD Steam version just makes it better. Totally worth the money."
One of the best games i have played in a long time. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
one of the best old school stratergy games out there !
About bloody time! One of the grandaddys of RTS PC gaming . 10/10
Simply a beautiful classic!
"I have played this game since I was super young, watched it disappear, and felt my jimmies rustling constantly. But now I'm 20 and the game lives on thru Steam! ^catfish slap^"
Still amazing after all these years =)  To this day I can start up a random map and find myself still stitting here 3 hours later =)
"one of the most entertaining stratagy games ever made. Each campaign is unique, the scenarios are fun, and hard mode is actually hard. 10/10 would Wololo again."
"just get AoE 3. Graphics are better, ai is better, living multiplayer. I'm not saying it's a bad game or anything, but it's just not as good as it could be"
"The game has a huge potential, but it has a lot of bugs. These bugs usually subside in certain gamemodes and if you play with people with a good connection."
"AoE2, what more can you say? One of the best RTS's from last 20 years, need more to have HD remakes now."
"An amazing game, one of the very classics of its genre.  The game itself deserves a 10/10, but I'm just shortly going to rate the steam HD version of it.  +Steam multiplayer! +New civilizations!  -'High definition' doesn't work or support with older monitors (4:3) -Very poor options menu, some of the older options are removed. Would expect more from a HD version.   6/10. Wouldn't recommend buying it for its full price."
I want to play this game right meow!
great game. brigns me back to the old days when i had my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc and was barely able to play the game
Age of Empires II HD combines the excellent RTS gameplay of the original game with improved graphics and access to modding. Basically a match made in heaven!
"AoE 1, 2 and EE where a big part of my childhood, I've probably spent close to a thousand hours playing it, and I still suck like the worst noob, but I had fun playing it on LAN and online with friends and family for hours. After the remake on HD + a new expansion the game is still as fresh as the first they back when it came out.  If you like RTS games this one's a must have."
Years of play in every pixel
Here is my childhood along with super mario RPG.
I CAN NOT GET IT TO PLAY!!!!!!!!!
"One of my all time favourites, grew up playing this game and wow did i enjoy every moment :D"
can't change game resolution in game or outside of game in the advanced options
how do you turn this on
RTS Just doesn't get any better than this.   I've been playing this game since I was given my first PC (Gateway 2000) in 4th grade. It's STILL fun to this day. What are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW!   BRING BACK RISE OF ROME IN HD PLEASE!
"the expansion blows tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, dracula campaign is sooo buggy i cant even enjoy this crappy old school game anymore"
"One of my favorite games of all time. Simple, yet it has the emergent property of being a very good strategy game!"
One of my favorite games ever played in my childhood :)
"Countless hours spent on AoE2 nonHD.  Unit pathing is bit clumsier as it was in noHD version making it hard to control large armies sometimes, but yet this is classic. must have it.  9/10"
Got killed 10/10 would fap again
"Originally released In 1999, Age of Empires II still has a massive following and playerbase. For good reason! This is one of the most enjoyable RTS games I have ever played, and with the customizability offered by the map editor this game truly has a lot to offer. The HD Version kept the gameplay almost exactly the same, but with upgraded graphics (like 3D water) that make it look even better. The few minor changes made (e.g Population limit increased from 200 to 500) are improvements as well. If you have never played Age of Empires II, you won't regret trying it!"
simply brilliant
"For all those who have played Age of Empires II or anyone who is a fan of the series this is a must buy, an amazing game with HD graphics. You will definitely get your moneys worth out of this."
this game is as complicated and fun as i remember it growing up. i wish you all had the same history that i have had with this game
This is one of the best games ever made. I played this when I was younger and never really stopped. This is the ultimate version because you can play it on newer pc's unlike the original. I recommend this game for anyone who even remotely likes real time strategy.
A must have classic.
Good old strategy game that is a must to have :P
Awesome game that I wish I would've known of 15 years ago!!
You don't know a good real-time strategy game if you haven't played (and fell in love with) this.
"Good game, would recommend!"
I played that game when i was child ~10-12 years ago. One of my first strategy game after Starcraft &amp; Expension: Blood War. This games remember me my childhood. Im not the PRO at this game but still i like it and i enjoy it. Maybe one day ill try the AOE III
One of the best RTS games out! Played it a ton on the non-steam version.
MONK! I NEED A MONK!
"Fan of the old Age of Empires II? Love RTS? Or a Noobie beginner just looking for a starting point. I highly recommend this game for three reasons, one, it is the most fun you will have on a 2D surface, two, it is one of the most historically accurate games you will ever play, and three, this is one of the few games you will play that involves actual strategy.  Hours of fun, loads of friends to make, and tons of stuff to learn."
"Horrible FPS even on top end systems. My comp is about mid range right now and im seeing 5-10 FPS. Went to look online for solutions and it looks like webmasters are taking down any posts about user fixes for the issue. High end systems are mostly reporting 20-30 fps and drops to 1-5 fps during battles. Until a later time when its fixed, I wouldnt recommend this game."
"Age of Empires 2 HD Edition........  Why are you evening looking at the reviews, buy the god damn game!"
"Awesome RTS game, lost many hours...days...of life playing this game over the years."
"Gr8 game, I think i can lead australia better than abbeeetttt now~"
"I used to play this as a kid... when I was litterally 5 years old. I still remember this game for what it is, I would no life this all day everyday. I really recommend this game."
"Great nostalgia hit, remastered and ready to go!"
"Best game in the series! By far! Strategy, epic battles and an amazing online community!"
"A true classic, this game is honestly the reason why my grades slipped as a kid. A solid remake of a well loved game."
"Oddly enough, this game is still fun to play to this day. However, as the RTS genre keeps growing and behemoths like Starcraft 2 exists soley for the purpose of destroying the competition of other RTSes out there, I don't know if I should acutally recommend this game. The only reason I am is because it's still a good game, but there are a few misleading features we need to talk about first.  Firstly this game is technically HD, but only because it supports 1080p resolution, the sprites, animations and environments haven't been updated at all and even the best workshop mods don't help out much, the variety of civilizations you can choose to play as gives the game a while lot of different play styles, but if you don't know exactly what each diffeence between the different civs means it will lead any newcomers to failure, also the game still stutters at times, even on my monster rig regardless of whether I play online or not... it's not very good.  The reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because it came out in 1999 and, despite the amount of work that could have gone into the game to make changes for the better and make it one of the hottest RPGs of today, all they did was update the resolution and compatability, a huge let down.  It's a good game for LAN parties for people who remember playing the game when they were twelve or so, not so much as of today.  You know what, I've changed my mind, I can't recommend this to anyone, except the nostalgic blind. There are much better RTSes out now and this one was more of a cash grab than it was the celebration of one of the best RTSes of all time by bringing it up to speed with what we've come to expect from an RTS of today."
"I grew up on AOE II way back in the days of yore, and I love playing it again in HD. Easy 10/10. Longbows for life."
"We got the original of this game in 1999, and the whole family has loved it ever since.  I'm actually really sad about this version, no matter how much I play with my screen resolution, everything comes out tiny and I can't read things, or see icons properly, or tell my little people apart. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix that? Because apart from that, it's an awesome game, and now much prettier than it was 16 years ago!"
Such a fun game! Brings back all the good memories!
This game is very good and i recomend this if someone want to play a fast game for war.
"Just like i remember it from my childhood, plus new campaign missions and new civilizations. Love it!!"
"One of the best game that I ever played. As all game, it gets only better when playing with friends. My freinds and I always use Google Hangout to chat while playing this game. We tried using steam voice chat, but didn't work to well.   I wish there was a lot more players playing this game, it is playable but not many options to choose problem. There is lag problems at times but can easily fixable if you as a admin pick who can play or not.   Totally recommend it, I really like the varities of the civiliation that you can choose from. It was difficult to pick up due but its definitely worth it. It can deter people away because of the graphics but, you can get used to it because its just fun.."
"perfect to waste some time and make a over powerd army that will desindergrade everything on its path,, afther figthing off the enemy at you'r city/town all the way from the start of the game  gather resorses and rellics explore the maps one afther de other,,, i had this game way before it came out on steam and its still nice to play on a slow weekend"
Nostolgic.. but that's all it's got for me...
Absolutely loved The Forgotten edition of the AoE.
Very fun and addictive. Reliving memories from the original release!
"Brings back so many memories of Saturdays around my mates. Still a great game, still so involving!"
"Nice game, it reminds me old times :')"
They finally thought of a way of making the greatest RTS game even better.
Classic game of the RTS genre and well worth a purchase when it is on sale. The expansions add a lot to the game to help you feel that you will never tire of playing it. I have played since it came out and I still don't think I've played out everything you can do on it.  10/10
It's a wonderfull title to anyone who loves strategy games :)
"I've been playing this game on and off for about 10 years at least, it's one of the best game series' to have ever been made, I couldn't recommend this game more!"
"I was very excited to play this game again. Got it on Steam, played with my friend...then the awful 'African Nations' expansion came out and BROKE THE GAME. We can no longer save multi-player games. We're not the only ones with this problem. The clowns in charge of this game say it's a high-priority bug, but it's been MONTHS now. How hard can this be? It used to work fine, and now it doesn't. Morons. DON'T BUY THIS BUGGY GAME!"
Excellent game. Really fun classic with more units and storyline in the DLCs. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
"Before anyone says anything, yes I know I could have spent more time playing. But too be fair, this was my main thing as a kid so I like to take that into account.   While I'm not the best at AOE2 (and I'll be the first to admit it), AOE2HD brought me back to the times where I would ignore all around me and build bombard towers right outside the enemy. While I can't really do that becuase the enemy will simply come up and wipe everyone out, I still love this game. I think this should be the first RTS someone plays if they're new to the series. It's simple and easy to pick up, but hard to master. The factions function largely similarly for avarage players, but in the hands of an expert or a specialist, a faction becomes a force of to not be messed with. The accessability mixed with the depth makes it here. There's a pretty wide community for the game to. I heard places like Voobly may have a more hardcore crowd, so if you're into that you shoud check them out. Since I'm not that savey with all that I prefer to stick to AOE2HD on steam."
"Combines both Age of Kings and Conquerors and Brings two Additional expansions into it with about 6 campaign stories with their own legs.  Only two Cons I found in the HD collection was the fact that when buildings were on low HP and were on fire before , the pixelated low res fire seemed like fire whereas the new fire effects that has been pasted over the same old buildings looks awkward. The 2nd is the fact that there is no AOE 1 and Rise of Rome.  10/10 same old AOE + more customizations."
Had the original back in the day. Loved it.  Bought this. Still love it. The extras beyond the original release[s] are great.
"Best strategy game ever created, worst netcode possible and throw in the mix of people that spike from 100ms to 6000ms and you have yourself one of the most infuriating game experiances ever made possible.  It's literally the same every game: Angel_Of_KinGz_xx: pop 500 plz! And you're like yea why not lets try it out. Only to find out that 60% of the players in the game are still using ISDN and windows 95 because when the game goes over like 200 pop it just breaks down. You try to kindly inform them that perchance they are downloading something? The only response you EVER_EVER_EVER_EVER_EVER_EVER_GET is something in their own stupid language, its either that or its one of those guys that doesn't know how to read. You know the guy im talking about, you literally call him out by his maiden birthname and you ask him NICELY to respond. He doesn't know how to press enter and type: StFU n0000ooOooOooB!!!!!  Atleast that would be a response to know that he is indeed alive and didn't die (most players are from sketchy countries that might get bombed by isis any second tbh).  10/10 gameplay 2/10 multiplayer  overall 12/10 score not bad!"
It's funny
"I have to admit having a bias growing up with this game (noncompetitive). It fascinated me with world civilizations. It told great stories that went into strategic gameplay. Campaign gameplay also had many unique events triggered in the middle of the game itself, so it would bend the player's priorities. There is no limit to how much you want to solidify your base before going on the offensive. Experienced professionals can develop a sense of resource gathering rates in order to train units at faster intervals while the risk of hitting zero resources is probably made up for by knowing quick key shortcuts and screen jumping.  As someone who played this game alone for long periods of time as a kid, it definitely has a lot to offer for the single player experience. Campaigns, single player matches against computers, online, and map editor are all included. I thanked the heavens for finding this game on steam because the compatibility graphic issues with my old game disc were becoming too much of a problem. You can select more units in this digital download, no worries with graphical glitches, and choose to download the extra civilizations pack if you'd like."
Old classic
Great classic.
...
"Back to my childhood !  just Awesome ,,, nothing more to say"
pretty awesome for its age. highly recommend
one of the best medieval rts games out there
"Still feels like the original, even suffers from that beautiful waiting to continue bug in the online :D"
very very classic game for the post-90s   that reminds me of my childhood
I grew up playing this game. In my opinion it's still one of the better RTS games on the market with this update and the community is very active and lively here on Steam.
Instant classic. Fell in love with this game when it was initially released I guess in late 90's. Best investment ever! It's still just as good as it was then and even better in HD. Works smoothly and is a must for every RTS fan :)
It just never gets old.  though some features need to be added.  Add ping and region in lobby browser so we know what will our ping be when we join a lobby.
Was a awesome game back in the day. Now the expansions have caused errors mainly with the FPS and it annoying to play. Please fix this and othr errors instead of bringing out more DLC packs.
I love all the nostalgic feelings about this game
"Just as I rememeber it! Classic and prob the best RTS i've ever played. Addictive, fun and easy to play but also a challenge it has the perfect mix and makes you come back for more. Must have played for 1000s of hours when i was younger!"
"Oh, Age of Empires. What a history we have together.   I remember playing the original game back when it was released in 1997 when I was very young. One of my very first computer games. I still even have the original disc that still runs on this pc. Thousands of hours have been spent on this franchise.   But enough reminiscing. This is an excellent HD remake of an excellent game. If you are an rts fan, pick up this improved upon classic.  8.3/10"
this game makes me feel old :3
"It's very similar to age of empires, but the definition... it seems... higher?"
"I have returned to my childhood when I was playing this game. I was realy suprised how much precise is HD version. But, in my P4, 1920x1080 resolution is little a bit slow."
8/10
Classic strategy game. Old but still fun to play.
Retro feelings!  Just as good as back in the days!  10/10  Slavecamp Simulator!
The HD version of the classic Age of Empires II AoK/AoC largely delivers. The online servers for multiplayer are reliable and there is a good community of players always willing to play. The amout of mods also does not disappoint if you are looking to mix up the routine. 9/10
"Really fun game, brings back my childhood memories, and since there is multiplayer it makes it a whole lot better"
"Such nostalgia! This is still my absolute favorite strategy game, graphics be damned. Sometimes the oldschool games just do it better."
My childhood = Age of Empires 2
It's a fun game with stratigic skill and takes knowledge to play properly.
"This game is worth every penny, especially for sentimental reasons"
Great Game
"One of the most fun RTS games you will ever find. Whether or not the games provides a sense of nostalgia, or you just want a good strategy game, AoE II is the route to go. The price is a little out there considering the game originally came out in the 1990s, but I'd say it's worth every penny.   Also, I only have so few hours in the game because I usually play offline or on the original disc I have."
I absolutely adore this game &gt;^w^&lt;  This was the game that introduce me to so many wonderful things &lt;3
"This is a really fun game.I mostly play Multiplayer with my friends, as we usually battle each other or bots, depending on how many of us there are. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone "
  7/10
Annoyingly addictive.
Wololo/10   Would Wololo again.
"Well made, addictive, well recognized skirmish platform. Missions are not really amusing."
After the african kingdoms expanction Im having trouble playing games with my friends. Is this a General problem or spacific to me? But in general I love this game and would rate it but. Multiplayer needs a ♥♥♥♥ing fix.
It's great to be able to play this classic game again and it brings all kinds of nostalgia. All of the features of Age of Empires II and the Conquerers expansion are there as well as a few new tweaks such as higher population limits and some new maps.  It is abit pricey with the release price being £15 (not sure what it is now) but you can certainly get addicted to this game.
A great classic!
"Does not launch properly and is unplayable, do not buy this game"
Not Mac Compatible
loved this game years ago and still going strong
Classic game of RTS! Highly recommended!
"Simply a higher resolution version of the classic medieval RTS we all know and love. Works in windows 7 too, so that's a plus!"
"Oh nostalgia. You can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Age of Empires 2 was always and will probably always be my favorite RTS of all time. But I was a child when I first played it and have been spoiled by good graphics. The game hasn't really changed since I played it as a kid for better or worse. Sure, the graphics may be better, but it's so ungodly slow paced compared to games today. I played a few campaigns and felt like it took me ages. If this game released today the way that it looks now and didn't collect from the nostalgia players, I would not recommend this. However, since only the nostalgia players will play this, I'm going to give this 5 whatevers out of 10. (I can't believe I just rated my favorite RTS of all time a 5)"
10/10 Kids from the 90s would buy!
"Best game on steam, 10/10 would recommend"
All in all this was a greath game and i liked playin it now. There are some terible gameplay aspects that i want to mention: THE MONKS!!! i mean what the hell. Play versus a hard AI und they will spam you with these guys until all your Men turn against you Come on wihtout the monks the game would be much better
"♥♥♥♥ YES, IT'S BACK!"
10 elephants can fit in a transport boat but 11 archers cant. 11/10
Hark! My childhood calls onto thee! Buy this masterpiece of the ages! The Settlers Dream! The Calvaries Templar! The Kings Fortress!
Best castle building sim 2k15 10/10 would spam again
if your new prepared to get yelled at
My favorite strategy game. Really fun with friends. Wololo!!
Decades and also has new expansion! Buy it now!  68/100 metacritic sucks. 100/68 I could install new expansions in 2026 again.  
"Timeless gameplay with historical context. Growing up playing this game, the HD version is just as you remember it! (Without all of the issues the original has running on modern processors!)  Vibrant Online Community, it's easy to find a game anytime. Also, steam workshop integration works great! It's really nice that mods auto install unlike the old CD-version, where you had to modify files yourself!"
It's fun but more difficult than Starcraft
"one of the best games ever made, sucks if ur bad at rts games"
9.5/10   Would build another Viking town with 50 monks in it some time to force Europe and the Middle East to convert to Odinism so they can be happier people.
"This is the masterpiece RTS that came from that great era. i would suggest this game too all players new or old, casual or hardcore, genuis or joe you can find fun in any way you play in this game."
"Made male villagers. Had them farm. Made female villagers. Had them mine, chop wood, and die.  10/10 Would be sexist again"
"One of those classic games that keeps you wanting to play more. One of the most balanced and unique rts games after all these years. For every type of unit there is a counter. My personal favorite unit, the teutonic knight, can be brought down by ranged horsemen and canonners, as they have a ton of armor and health but are very slow in movement. One must always be vigilant to win this game, as it can be over in the early ages or turn into a bloodbath late in the game. Monk rush FTW."
This is one of the first games I ever played as a kid. Playing it again in multiplayer with my friends is just as fun now as it was back when the game first came out!
"Commanded one of my builders to build a few houses for more resident space, traps himself inside a ring of houses and forces me to pick between him and a house... Lets say the property value dropped.  11/10"
hey bros this game is mad fun if u enjoy death i assure you this game is something youll remember playing or not bc youll be dead idfk i have 6 arms
"Classic RTS. Not too complex but not too simple. Throw in some cheat codes and steam roll the computer during a lunch break or play by the rules with friends anywhere in the world. This is the best way to experience the game.   Hoping they allow for populations higher than 500 in future releases. I'd love 2,000. That would be an amazing way to experience AOE warfare."
They increased the maximum population size to 500. You can make 500 petards/priests/cannon galleons.
"Great game, old taste refreshed in glorious 1080p"
this game wont play plain and simple its either the game or steam but it wont work. tried looking on forums to fix the issue paid 20 dollars for this stupid game. 20 dollars to look at a menu and get some history lessons that i can get from wikipedia. i am asking for a refund.
"I finally got around to buying this and I'm so glad I did! AOE II was one of my favorite games, and with the new HD graphics and expansions, it's even more fun. I especially like the larger maps, more interesting maps and scenarios, and the ability to create large civilizations."
"Played AoE I and II since I was a kid and it's good to see that it's still on - the III didn't worked so great and they made a wise choice to keep on working on Age II instead (need a HD version for the I tho). Undoubtedly the Age serie (empires and mythology) is by far the best real-time strategy games.  It can be extremely chaleging, even more if you try to be good with all kinds of warfare (infantary, cavalry, archer, siege, naval, defence and so on instead of focusing in only one), or it can be a walk in the park - even after finishing all campaing on hard I still like to play them on easy.  Being casual or hardcore game, old school or graphic lover, action or strategic player - no matter that because Age of Empires can have the perfect map and civilization for you. Has a bonus there is some nice interpretations of how things happened in history (some way off tho)."
-Only play multiplayer vs AI with friends -Always rename my steam account 'Goblin Expansionists' for AoE II time -Realize Spanish has a unique tech to make villagers 'good in combat' -Only build villagers all game -Strip the land of all of its resources -Build 12 town centers -200 villagers -Attack enemies with maxed villager tech -Villager AI doesnt automate combat -Villagers run around and get slaughtered unless I specifically tell them to attack -Enemy starts to destroy my empire -Give 10k+ of each resource to my friend and afk -come back to victory screen later GG ez game 10/10
"This game, my God this game...it's been in my life for 16 years and it's still rocking! There's even a team working on new content for this HD Edition now! What can I say, buy, love, play this. Because It's one of the best games ever made."
WAAAT IT IS CRAZY AND PIXELIZED
how do i play my own map with my friends ?
'MONK I NEED A MONK!'
"Age of empires and Age of mythology ive been playing for over 7 yrs and i love them. For people who love strategy, and medieval based RTS youll enjoy this game alot. Personally i like age of kings (II) better than any other AOE, but that depends if you like simple or more complicated. AOE has a ton of gameplay and a great structure. If you have a decent computer it wont lag at all! :) And since this game now is on steam since Apr 9,2013 it has a full working workshop and mod support. alot of RTS or games like this in general dont have that. it is TOTALLY WORTH the money and i look forward to new games like this one."
One of the greatest strategy games of all time!
"This game sucks don't buy it, steam when they remastered it made it way worse it looks better but plays like a cunty piece of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥."
Get this - still the best game ever!
"One of my favorite games of all time. Well worth it, even years after my childhood."
"Age of Empires, an old friend you had been playing with when you was younger and then you lost contact for years, decades. You have thought that you will never see it again. You felt, that it is somehow right, you remembered all the good times... like... like when you were not able to achieve progress to Castle age under 25 minutes and lost the game. Or when you did not built enough of army infrastructure and lost another game... or when you sent your mighty cavalry to convince your enemies of your superiority, then watch it die horribly in fight with pack of spearmans and lose the game again. (Oh yes, I have lost few games, if you ask.)  And still you have to go back to these times sometimes and think: 'Oh yes, Age of Empires, yes, these were the times. I am so sorry that I cannot play it again on current operation systems without any flaws. Or over internet via MSN Games.'  Good news - this is The Age Of Empires 2 as you left it laying last time you finished the game. It's stable and yes - the HD does not mean very improved graphics, but just higher resolution. To be honest, it is gold-mining from the publisher and developers on one hand, but on the other - would you change anything on something that beatiful and flawless like this game were then? I don't think so.  You can expect following things amongst new features: Steam multiplayer, achievements, higher resolution than in the original game, some better gfx and definitelly better community than DOTA have for example. You can enjoy this game as casual player! And don't be called fu**ing noob in languages you don't know.  So what are you thinking of? Go and grab a copy, if it's on sale. You say you have never played it? Then shh, don't tell anyone and buy this first real time strategy in your life and join wonderful community. :-)"
"The HD version adds little to the original except bugs and odd behaviour:  1. The shortcut keys have changed. 2. AI rarely attacks with elite units. 3. Trebuchet shortcut keys don't work. 4. Monks sometimes autoheal, sometimes they don't. Impossible to coordinate battles.  The only plus is you can set the population limit to 500."
I love all the nostalgic feelings about this game
Played as Berbers in China and got defeated by Ethiopians. Alternate World history/10
"This is one of the best games of all times and i've always had a copy of it since it came out, but i always wondered if there would ever be a realistic expansion of castles. I would love to see a Neuschwanstein, conway or Mont St. Michael Castle in the game. Its not possible at least somthing like Lord of the Rings with elfs and ogres would be pretty cool too. Although these are what i would like to see in the game this game in particular must be in everyones Library its too good."
"Never played this until this HD version came out. I highly recommend this game to anyone who was into starcraft or Red Alert. This can bring hours of fun with a small set of friends. Be warned, games can last a damn long time if you have a lot of people in one game!"
I love this classic game .not very different from the original release (Graphics wise) but still a great game.
I won't say it is the best multiplayer game out there but It is my all time favorite multiplayer game. It is so much fun to play with friends.
Classic RTS. No reason this game isn't in your game library if you're a true PC gamer. And these are just the amount of hours I have on this steam version. I used to play on a mac and used a WIN simulator just to play this game. Huns for lief
AWESOME NEED FRIENDS TO PLAY IT THOUGH
"after downloading, it worked beautifully for three days. now I can't launch the game. It tells me every time that there is already an instance of the game running. I've tried multiple tips and tricks to no avail. I am still unable to play. Starting to really ♥♥♥♥ me off. I haven't found any help on the matter."
Got this game since the old one didn't work online and I missed it so...its a great game and good to be back sending giant armies to mass the computer!
10/10 would wololol again
"A classic city building strategic battle game that can be a bit challenging at first, but is definitely worth the effort. I highly recommend looking at the complex 'webs' for the various cultures you could choose to be. Asking a seasoned veteran of the game (of which I am not... yet) is also a great way to get helpful pointers when you're feeling kind of stuck."
Its a Great Game . Only problem i have is Steam server lags a lot compared to other gaming servers i have played on
Favorite game of all time.
"A classic given a fresh breath of air that it desperately needed. I used to have to spend hours doing various tricks to get my old Age of Empires 2 cd's to run on multiple computers in order to LAN nights with my family and friends, but with this new revision its as simple as a couple of clicks.   They have reworked the game in subtle ways that im very thankful for, they have not gone and done too much, but just the right touch, if you get sick of the 'old school look' as some people critize it for you can simply go to the workshop and download one of many fantastic HD graphic packs. I personally use one myself that makes the game look absolutely B-E-A-UTIFUL!.   I have also not experienced any issues with the multiplayer component as i have noticed some people complain about, i think its more of a need to have a good connection than a fault of the game as me and none of my family or friends have had any noticable issues, i have only had one time where the game disconnected and i later found out that it was due to my ISP somehow managing to screw something up.   Also, if your not a fan of multiplayer, you can play the campaign, its masterfully done, very enjoyable, and will show you what a RTS campaign should be.  So, If your looking to enjoy a classic RTS, than look no further. This game is a classic and very enjoyable."
The game of all our child hoods with a friendly community mod support and a thriving set of developers bringing in updates to make the game better and better.  Is there really anything else to say?
The bots have a much more challenging AI to go up against. Great for those who played the original AoE II.
"Age of Empires 2 is an absolute classic and is just as good today as it was all those years ago when it was released. It's a classic strategy game - collect resources with your villagers, build buildings and recruit soldiers. There's a very basic technology progression system too. The campaigns are a lot of fun to play, there's Joan of Arc, Barbarossa, Genghis Khan and a few others. Multiplayer used to be a lot of fun too but I haven't tried to play it in several years so it might be dead.  To say something bad about it for balance - the AI is predictable. It will send an army to a certain location in your territory and once it has given the order that army will travel until it reaches that destination. You can attack it as it travels to that location but it will not respond so if you have a powerful enough army you can pretty much kill it before it arrives."
"A classic, you can't go wrong with this rts, one of the best around."
great game
Very fun to play and nicer in HD!
"A classic gem of the strategy franchise, and arguably a staple RTS game in the childhood of many gamers. A surprisingly dedicated effort at improving the AI makes it just as enjoyable as it was back when Ensemble Studios was still intact. If you've played this game from a long time ago, and you're looking for a trip down memory lane, this is the way to do it."
Nostalgia + it is actually a good game.
Fun and addicting RTS. Soundtrack and visuals are awesome.
"One of the best classics you can play. I have played every single Age of Empires game that has ever been released. Out of all of them, I would have to say this one is the best because it has an almost infinite replayablity aspect. You can play alone or with a few friends in multiplayer but nothing beats over-running other empires with your troops. When I heard Ensemble Studios was closing down for good, I was crushed because I knew nothing in the near future would continue such an amazing game series. I played this originally when it first came out on the CD's. Coming back now in HD makes this game so much more immersive than before. I would recommend this game to anyone who is into the RTS and City Builder genre.   Solid 10/10 -Please come back Ensemble Studios, You are missed."
I like this game.The only problem is the awful online multiplayer.Never have i seen so much lag and delay.Even when i play with people that are close to me it lags and delays.The game overall is amazing.Just don't expect too much for multiplayer.
""
One of the classics. It's a must have
Its a Fanatastic Strategy game which can be played by 8 players together . 
I don't know how to play. Please send help.
"If you play this game after playing modern strategy games, you might be a little underwhelmed. 'Why is this game so generic?!' You ask. Well, as it turns out, the reason it seems generic and boring is because IT INVENTED THIS GENRE OF VIDEO GAMES YOU DIP. OF COURSE IT'S GUNNA SEEM GENERIC."
"Age of Empires 2 is a classic real time strategy game. This remake of the original holds all of the classic gameplay with modernized graphics. This game only changed a few things from the original, like the hotkeys. Overall this is a great game that I recommend for anyone interested in either history or strategy games."
"I first played Persian Elephant Simulator '99 when it came out, and had a lot of fun with it! They have since released this HD re-imagining of the game and...it looks pretty much like I remember it looking. This is good! Most games from 15 years ago look like a toddler jammed lego blocks into my eyes, so they must have done something neat with the bits and bytes. The campaign is still affront to God, but the multiplayer works well and allows you to play with multiple people playing the same Civ. This allows everyone to fight over what the Persian elephants should be doing, with the winner being the last person to ragequit. Eight Persian Elephants out of some amount to be named later."
My only beef is that you can't take screenshots. I've had it for a month and I already have 60 hours. I'll let you figure out the playthru value.
Playing online with my mates is great.  'Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* *Laugh* Wololo.'  Cooperative is just beautiful.
Defo worth getting
"Crashes in multiplayer like every 2nd time. Always some network connection issues. Not only at my pc, but also on friends. Bad coding. After so many years bugs are still not fixed?"
A very good quality upgrade and the new A.I. is way more challengging it`s avery good experience to play with your friends
that game's my childhood!  any questions?
Excellently remastered!
"Quality, old school game. The graphics haven't aged well, even with the HD reboot, but the online play more than makes up for it!"
AoE II has aged wonderfully and is even better than I remember it.
"Great game! Brings up so many memories, and it's great to play in such a cool version with extra features and everything else!"
"I remember playing this on my PlayStation 2, i wasted HOURS trying to defeat the AI Bot Enemies, using different strategies everytime! Now... Like almost 10 years later, im playing it again trying to end my epic journey on defeating the AI! Its a good game that i would always come back to, no matter how 'old' this game is..."
A bloomin awesome game that you can get beaten on frequently. Never gets old. Love it!
"This was the first legit video game I played as a kid, after the Original Age of Empires. I've spent countless hours on it over the past 15 years and still do. I'm glad I got the chance to get this on Steam as it's allowed me to continue playing again since my brother 'borrowed' my disc copy a couple of years ago. If you've never played this and like basebuilding RTS's, buy it.  However, the AI on the Steam version seems to be different from the original version. I've noticed that, regardless of difficulty, the AI is pretty stupid. They almost always mass the same 2-3 units and sometimes, they'll have an army of 100 monks. These things never happened on the original disc version, the harder the AI, the more balanced their army would be and they would actually purchase units to counter yours. On the Steam version, a lof of the time the AI will just send their soldiers to your walls and they'll just sit there while you kill them with your towers. The AI is just stupid most of the time on this version. That is my lone complaint. The game is still worth buying though."
Classic.
"If you've played this before, buy it right away. They took a nearly perfect strategy game and redid it with Steam support and improved graphics. If that wasn't enough, they're still updating and patching it, and they're even making a new expansion which will feature even better multiplayer support. They are really working to make this a great multiplay experience again, and not just trying to cash in on the success of a great game by updating the graphics and calling it a day."
I remember when I played this game with friends back in 2008 and 2009. This is a fantastic game and I have good memories. Easy 10/10
Best of the Age of Empires series.  Never get sick of it
"Probably the best RTS game ever made. Now with an HD update, it's even better. They are even adding new content to the game and updating some of the features in game. While it does have it flaws here and there, I would still recommend trying it."
"For those of you who ignore the reviews of this game beware. I bought this game out of nostalgia with steam money earned from other games while AoE was $5. I don’t necessarily regret buying the game, but I was very disappointed that everything the reviewers said came true after only 5 hours of play (offline I have around 15 hours).   The game grinds to a literal halt when more than 100 units are on the screen. You might think this is during battles, which does happen, but this was just when I had grouped the units and moved them. When the fighting started I had trouble moving people to the right spot. Additionally, changing my video settings didn’t improve this.  Online fighting possesses the same trouble as before. Lots of lag and DC.  The controls and unit AI have not been improved at all. Not that I was expecting this but I was little disappointed the devs couldn’t at least make unit movement a bit more intelligent. Such as a unit moving from point A to point B and not run up to enemy units before turning away or run away when you’re attacked (workers). The different stances are really only good if you are keeping an eye on the units or they have a wall to fight behind. For example, defensive stance is great to hold a position but the units get confused when hit with enemy ranged units that are far off out of their assigned area. Moving large groups in any formation has not been improved at all. Again, I was not expecting any of these improvements when I bought the game but after so long since the original release I expected something more.  All in all, I would not recommend this game for anyone but someone who played the original. In my opinion, this shouldn’t cost more than $10 normally. Asking $20 is ridiculous considering how little was added to the game in what matters. Who cares if content is added if gameplay and the online experience have not been improved. You won’t enjoy what is added.   EDIT: Things can change. People do try. Much improved since I wrote this. Except the price, stick to the discount if you can."
"A classic.  You can play this game just as well as any modern RTS, although you will notice that high APM and strategy gameplay makes many civilisations useless if you fight against pros. It was one of the games that defined the RTS genre as it became what it is now. Base-builidng in this game is excellent, although they might want to re-balance some things for the faster type of game that is played in most other RTS.  On the other hand, it is nice to be rewarded for patience in a strategy."
all u hav 2 do is make farms n build stuf its so gud lol
"Updated review 01-19-2016  I would really love to recommend this game, and I hate having the write this but it must be done. If you spend any amount of time on the Steam AOE2HD forums you will find innumerable people complaining about low FPS on beefy machines in-game. I used to not have this issue until mid 2015; I stopped playing the game for a while hoping the devs would fix it, needless to say this never happened. It is insane that my 16gb of ddr3 1600MHz RAM, 3570k running at 3.8 GHz and GTX 770, on an Samsung EVO 840 SSD cannot get above 20FPS ingame! Due to the lack of any fixes in 6 months I am forced to concluide this is just a cash grab on behalf of Microsoft; AVOID AT ALL COSTS!      Original Review  Age of Empires the original was the game that got me into gaming seriously. Before then I was just casual player that never took games seriously. When Age of Empires II came out in 99 the series evolved so much that it went from having a small and generaly reclusive fanbase, to gaining global attention. Even today there is a massive community for regular (non-Steam)AOE II(Age of Empires 2). When I saw that there was an HD remake of the game on the Steam platform, I instantly pre-ordered it without hisitation. This game has all of the aspects of the original with new Steam matchmaking, as well as some other minor tweaks. This is one of the best RTS (Real Time Strategy) titles of all time in my opinion. That being said it is now very dated and while I still recomend it to anyone who has never played the original game it is more for entry level RTS players and nostalgic players like myself. Also on a side note, the Forgotten Empires 'DLC' is a totaly free and community developed mod for the original AOE II; I am very disapointed in Valve for charging players to utilize that mod. Here is a link to the regular non-Steam Forgotten Empires page in case you dont belive me  http://www.forgottenempires.net/ "
"Great game that is a stellar classic. This edition makes it easy to play the game on newer computers. My original version on disk wouldn't play well.  They changed the hotkeys, which is quite the annoyance to older players."
Huns you the real mvp  10/10  would petard rush again
one of the best games of all time for sure
"Great update, well worth it especially if you can find it on sale. So much nostalgia."
"Its clearly F#ckn Sick C#nt, I mean if you look at it, they are still making S#it for it. Ergo, Therefore: F@ckn Sick"
"5/5, Revived oldschool :)"
best oldscholl game ever. i wish i could play it native on my mac...
"The original version of this game was absolutely amazing! This remake is just as great! Aside from just being fun to play this game is also very educational if you play through the campaigns. You can learn all about significant figures in history like Joan of Arch, Genghis Khan, or Montezuma to name a few. Throw in the custom map making and you've got an amazing game. Highly recommend it!"
"IGN/10 would wolololo again.  A classic that has aged well. This happened to be one of the first games I ever played when I was a kid. And even though I was never a great player, I still loved this game. Its an awesome RTS and im so glad to see it on steam and getting content updates.   I reccomend this because: +its a fun game to play solo or with friends +gameplay is skill based (not luck) +f you're a fan of the old version, this is a good choice because of new content (and steam workshop) +working multiplayer, with the option to save mp games and continue another time  +has a competitive side to it +nostalgia  +well made singleplayer campaigns +good map/scenario editor +plenty of civilizations to play which means multiple playstyles    "
"This wont open. Please help, I am a student and need AOE in my life"
Very similar to the original game. There are no real graphic changes and the fire animatins are bugged. The Gameplay is exactly like the old game. But still it's a great game. Buy it when it's in the sale
Very good game to play with others 
"You know, when people talk about RTS genre, only 1 game comes to mind instantly...and that's Age of Empires 2. Be it for the nostalgia trip that you embark on when you turn it on and hear the soundtrack that made you proud and powerful long ago, or just for the perfectly assembled gameplay and mechanics of warfare and menagement of units that are a MUST to learn if you want to get anywhere in multyplayer. Every win against another player is an achievement, and every loss is a brutal punishment on your ELO, and it is because of this very fact that this game is so overwhelmingly interesting! It is a matter of honor to be good at AoE2 ,that feeling of acomplishment is what keeps you going. Every game is different and every civilisation is unique (and there are a lot of them to be unique) . It is just a perfect package...a Legend of the RTS genre, a Master of nostalgia and most importantly, a game that is just as good now as it was nearly 20 years ago! Simply put, a MASTERPIECE, a Mozzart of strategy games, a proud father who's rightful heir is yet to come!"
Absolute Classic highly reccomend if you like Aoe
"Still by far one of the best RTS Games out there, this is really the 'BEES KNEES'. Along with the nastalgic feeling I feel as if everything about this game cries out. 'I AM THE BEST AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST.' In its own area, Age of Empires has really made its stamp on gaming history. As much as I dislike all the new phone apps. This game will always have a place in my library."
1999/10 will feel nostalgic again...
"This game I had since I was a kid. Somehow I can`t transmute the hours spent at childhood here hahaha. Very well. This game has the perspective to iniciate the mind of the gamer in an old kind of way to create a (mini farm?) kingdom and to rise it with intelligence. The main objective is simple (not for the campaigns) that is build your kingdom and to destroy your enemies. The graphics are enough to play even in old computers ( I had one and played with full capacity). But there is one thing that you guys players need to put in mind. When you start a kingdom it will take hours of your life to maintain it. And when you come back to your senses it will have passed hours, days and months. So take care and play AOE with maximum POWER!"
This the the best game of all time!
"Fantastic revival of a classic and, in my opinion, timeless game. Loving the new content and the existence of a modding community as well as the overall handiness of Steam covering installation, patching, etc... What I would really love, as a Near Eastern and Classic historian, is to see the same treatment done for Age of Empires 1/Rise of Rome, perhaps even with updating to AoK platform standards, that would be icing on the proverbial cake."
"THIS GAME IS EPIC, my cousin and I play for hours on end.   Such a classic RPG!"
9.3 a game i'll keep coming back to
"For new player this game may be very unintuitive and therefore frustrating. You must actually spend many hours just to learn how play it.. really! Its in fact not even 'game' but 100% interactive movie, even combat is made from animations of fight. Am actually don't believe this sword touch anything in surrounding, you just click different objects to play different animations and that is all 'game' If you are not fan of movie, character and story they you may possibly bounce off from it like ball from wall. Don't expect anything whatsoever like Elder Scrolls, Gothic, Risen etc. it should have own category its that different."
"This game is supprizingly awesome for such an old game. This is a case of : graphics don't matter .. even though it is the HD version it still looks kinda bad but heck with that, the gameplay is awesome.. great fun when having a LAN-party :)  10/10"
Niki suck on this game
Ever since i was a little boy :')  The memories fly back to me from trebuchets: - so far away - so long ago - such high impact
I've had this masterpece since i was a kid... like 5... Still one of the Greatists RTS in the known Universe and the HD just makes it all the better
I changed the religion of a house. 10/10 would convert again.
its not hd     1/10-ign
"Best game ive ever played. This is actually my favorite game. Aoe2 has many great civilizations,wide variety of maps, and tons of gameplay. if you are going to buy this i would get the forgotten expasion which is great and i nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself when i saw a new expansion, the afican kingdoms is coming out which i plan to buy, one complaint though is that the aztecs will destroy you and even be a pain on easy. so this game is really worth it and you should get it if you dont have it."
A must-have classic!
"Glorious, Forever, Glorious!"
"since 1997 the first age of empires through out all of age of empires games, age of empires 2 stands out as an awesome game game play, graphics everything perfect. 10/10"
This i probably the best game ever!!!!!!!! :) i think so anyway!! :)
I really suck at this game.
"This is by far one of the best RTS games ever created. I played this game 2006 and honestly it was one of the best experinces ever, and now the game is back with an updated steam edition and a revivied commiunity. The game has fun campains and enjoyable music, but as allways the game shines in multiplayer. Multiplayer is a lot of fun with a active community, if you find some good friends to play with you can have endless hours of fun."
My first experinces with a computer in my life was with this game. I can now relive my childhood.
It it really fun sinagle player and MultiPlayer
its good. Its a classic. Do you really need much considering? If you like RTS's and such then you will like this. K? 
Best game ever! childhood of doom :)
Killed a villager and watched his friends run away like sad little cockroaches as my calvery hunted them down and made them pay for their sins of cutting down those tree people in the forrest who were my friends. 10/10
ITs not that complicated..... but it is...
How can you not like this game?
"I'd recommend this game for all the reasons I would recommend the original AOE2.   For those unfamiliar with the series, the premise is that you build a giant maze out of fortified walls, keeps, and bombard towers, construct a wonder in the middle, and watch the other players rage."
classic if you loved it years ages and its your thing cant complain
This is the same '99 experience! Awesome!
"I joined Steam for this game. I still have original install disks for Age of Empires I &amp; II but when nieces and nephew discovered this game on Steam, I joined and bought the game again so that I could plan with them. Still just as great a game as it ever was. I'm glad a new generation is discovering it."
Decent Steam version of an all-time classic. First time that we managed to get LAN games with 4+ players working problem-free.
"best RTS ever, a timeless classic :)"
Awesome remake of the game. Would wololo again.
"One of the most tantalizing, and stimulating strategy games out there, I believe. A game from my childhood and well into my adult years; couldn't be more nostalgic."
You already know. The OG series.
Fun game to play with friends
Great game . A true legend
I've loved this game since I was about 5 years old. I love how they didn't change the game. Everything is perfect in this game and online is fun. Nothing will change the way I feel about this game.
"Just like old time, all the great memories this game game bring"
Love it. Nice upgrade of a game that i had a lot of fun playing. Will have to give the multi-monitor a try.
One of the best RTS games out there. You should defintely consider getting it.
"Classic Age of Empires II HD has all the elements of the orginial game plus more. Worth the buy especially during this winter sale. Great time killer, fun campaign, and good 'replayability'"
Best strategy game
"played it when it originally came out, loved it. got it when it came out on here, love it &lt;3"
Obviously a classic game - and it's still getting monthly patches!
"Great game to play with friends. This game great challenges and oportunities for fun. Provides the ability of a quick or long game, gives so many options."
"It's like Age of Empires 3, but the graphics are somewhat outdated and everything feels more realistic.  I recommend that you buy this game on sale or off sale if you have a lot of  gold  money."
A solid RTS that has a nice level of depth and complexity. Good single player campaign. It is very dated visually but if you can get past that it holds up nicely.
Great rehashing of an amazing game. love it.
This is a great game the best i have ever played it helped me learn tactics and many things about history.
"This RTS game has prooven itself to be timeless. I bought it for reasons of nostalgia and have sunk another 700 hours into it... thanks to the addicting Multiplayer. The SP offers a lot more than before, especially with the Forgotten Expansion, but the game lives of it's reputation as a great MP game for various reasons."
Love it! Fun to play!
Please make this game available for MAC
"More than a decade since the game's initial release, this game is still relevant- for a reason. This game was a fixture of my childhood, and I was delighted to get another chance to play for such a reasonable price. The campaigns are in depth, the gameplay is functionally optimal, the multiplayer is new every time (with only a few moments of lag), and the updated graphics are stunning. The game even tricked me into learning about the featured civilizations with informative overviews on the main menu.  TL/DR you'll get your money's worth: 95/100"
this is the greatest game ever created
This Game is consecitivly given my computer two trojans within the files.
"I had always played AOE III and AOM in the past, but never played AOE II until recently. I still question this, and why did it have to ruin my life now?!   Oh, and I also destroyed the Ethiopians with the Vikings...  11/10"
"I really wanted to like this game. It showed so much promise, it had a very large list of different factions, which appealed to me at first. But then you look at the tech tree and see that every faction in the game is almost identicle. They all have the same units, buildings and research. (Except some factions have certain units crossed out on their tech tree, for example the celts can't build cannons etc.) The only real difference between the factions is one late-game unique unit and tiny percentage boosts for certain units, for example the celts are mainly infantry based so all their infantry move 10% faster. This lack of individuality between the factions has led me to dislike this game. It promised glory and a world of conquest but what I got was cloned factions that are all basically the same.  Final verdict: 4/10 - I'm sure some people enjoy this game, I am not one of them."
"Been playing AOE series for decades and the fun never stops. Olololo, Olololo!"
"Great RTS to play with friends at one of the better prices you will find these kinds of games at. personally didnt play many of the Age of Empires series but this one does a good job of making you realize why the game has such positive reviews. I would add this one to the collection of RTS games to play with friends or kill some time alone on, both are equally enjoyable"
"I remember playing this for hours in my dad's computer and I would get really excited whenever i hear the theme song playing. Now I can play this with the game of thrones theme song on for extra awesomeness.  I remember playing this for hours commanding a hundred soldiers and a squad of trebuchets toppling down castles and massing fortifications. Now i can command HUNDREDS of soldiers and a squadron of trebuchets for extra epicness.  I remember playing this for hours playing the awesome campaigns with the likes of genghis khan, Barbarossa, El Cid and Joan of arc. Now i can play MORE campaigns with the likes of a Conquistador, Italian mercenary and a visigoth barbarian for extra content.  I remember playing this in my dad's old computer lagging a bit but i would still enjoy and have the time of my life. Now i get to play this is 1080p and 60 frames per second for extra beauty.  I would remember the corny sound-effects, taunts and voices like 'wololo', *soldier trained sound* and *villager trained sound*. now i can hear it with good audio and cool downloadable taunts from the workshop like Arnold Swcharzenegger for extra funnyness (is that even a word?)   My childhood would never die when this game, Age of Empires II, is still around."
"Huge fan already, rose tinted nostalgia glasses on and off. The balance amongst a plethora of races is going to lead (for myself) to an unnecessary amount of hours invested in exploring each individual races unique natures. Gitting gud (online) is a difficult but rewarding process, even if casul; paired with a loyal fan basis maintaining a decent number of multiplayer servers keeps the game quite alive. Lastly the single player campaigns offers a fair amount of hours to chew through and are fun to boot. In contrast to many current releases lacking a single player campaign this is a decent inclusion not lacking in creativity and historical intrigue to enjoy. - 2/10"
"One of the best RTS games ever made now remastered, what more could you possibly ask for? Seriously get it so I can actually win a game."
This game is a classic and a must own for RTS fans. Online is still active enough to get a game whenever you want and the game has aged very well. Go yourself a favor and pick this up!
I'll beat you back to Age of Empires.
"This game was great at its time, now it's just dumb and outdated. I wished that Steam stopped trying to milk our money with old stuff like this and...   *Wololo! Wololo! Wololo!*   This game is freakin' great! Loved it then, love it now! Thanks Steam for bringing this back! 11/10"
"I'd love to play it. Sadly, I can only play with beta 4.3 checked. Everything else gives me a Validating Subscriptions CTD. Garbage."
&gt;Downloads new expansion pack &gt;Starts a 1v1 with Original AI being one of the new civilisations &gt;AI only makes 6 civilians &gt;30 minutes in 3 of the AI's civilians get eaten by a wild boar &gt;AI in chat: 'All of my starting civilians were male' &gt;AI resigns  10/10 would wipe out a civilisation with a wild boar again.
"it's a fun game that may take a little while to get used to, but once you get into it, it gets really fun. being crushed in a second, and winning by miles can be two games one after the other, but it's not like that has anything to do with luck, it's just what the other players and AI do. remember to play your own way and have fun with this game at first, if you want to do some hardcore training later go ahead, but i still say you should play your own way first. remember to have fun, and thank you for reading my rambling description"
"One of the first PC-games I´ve played(the original CD-version). I can say that this is game is one of the best and funniest in the world and it learned me more history than school ever did. Recommended for all players that like nostalgia, history and strategy."
:) 
"Really fun due that it's one of those old games which get better as soon as you get the hang of it... thing still not accomplished by me but that doesn't stop me from playing 2vs2 with my friends or the pc on hard in Black Forest. Campaign is good and if you let the enemy get the upper hand, it usually ends up as a starvation war and when the enemy has no more wood, you just breeze in but that's hardly recomended, it's way better to counter the enemy waves. One thing that I personally think it's stupid is that this game is being updated on 2015 and lags as in the times where people had dial-up due to the amount of units on the map. I know nothing of game making, but I think everyone has that problem since the release of the game and is barely addressed. Buy the game, if you didn't know about this game probably you are going to get dissapointed by the gameplay. Check some videos on youtube toget a general idea and for those who want a 60 FPS multiplayer game, you will mostly get a 10 FPS game but you get used to it."
Possibly the best RTS game out there. Endless hours of campaign and amazing multiplayer. Plus map makers what else do you need?
Still my favorite game. I remember the first demo played and never give up to play.
"'Hey bread, meet my sea army.'  hey gold.  meet MY SEA ARMY  god what a great match"
The game that changed my childhood. In my opinion one of the best of it genre.
"build a work camp where you harvest lumber, minerals and make food for da armies"
"I reccommend this game to all the poeple who like strategy games. Surely the best of the series and one of the best of the genre. Excellent AI in all difficulty levels, and unlimited hours of fun with your friends online. The civilizations are well balanced."
"apparently it is not supported on windows xp was able to play the game for a while, used to have it on disc was a great game."
Nostalgia... and then some.
It was very fun revisiting a game i played growing up in higher resolution for a few hours. A must play if you like real time strategy. The problem for me personally is i can't get into it anymore like i did when i was younger because i played and enjoyed several other rts games more since then and i also played this game alot growing up maybe the fatigue is still there. However if you have never played it you should definitely at least try it out. 6/10 (Decent)
What can I say? This is probably one of the greatest strategy games ever made. Play it.
Absolutely Great :)
A good blast from the past. Still fun to play and I like the fact that it has an editor that allows you to create your own maps.
Hey look it's a small village let's take it out. Moves in to position. Suprise attack by knights. Has army wiped out. 10/10 would be wiped out again 
Age of Empires II is arguably one of the greatest video games ever created for the PC and is a solid must buy for any real time strategy gamer.  It has become an example for which many other RTS titles have come to hold as a standard to emulate over the many years which have passed since this title has released. AoE II isn't too complex as to shave off the casual crowds but isn't too simple as to lose its luster over time. This game has proven to bring back players time and time again over the ages.  With dozens of unique civilizations that harbor their own architectural styles and unique units it is difficult to grow bored whether players stick to the at times difficult campaigns or duke it out against other players online. The gameplay is always changing and the map editor alone offers up unlimited posibilities. Don't pass up the opportunity to purchase this title.  One flaw for some would be buggy achievements at times but nothing that will interfere with the gameplay itself should be expected.
"AOE is as great as ever. I would say even better, seeing how it's fully integrated with steam, and setting up a game with friends online was a breeze.  It's one of those games that you hardly see it's age. Sure, the menu's are a bit oldschool, but that doesn't take away from the experience. And maaaan, what can i say about civilizations description, and all the little details that make this game not only great, but stays with you for a long time. Even if it doesn't go into crazy amounts of historical detail, it surely isn't a vapid superficial game. One of the things i still aprectiate about old school PC games like this, it doesn't make you feel like a moron."
worth buying
"Oh yes, Age of Empires was my childhood (after Age of Mythology of course) and gave me years of fun, with the HD edition you get all of that as well as better graphics."
I Doubt that the Devellopers will see this but I Desperately need help with something I recently have been playing my pc on my 4KTV and its difficult because the units and the text is too small in the game hopefully if the devs are reading please add 4K support for this game and try to make it possible to change the in game resolution please and Thank you! I love this game dearly and it would mean the world to me to get this issue fixed
Timeless classic...  After more than 65 hours of gameplay on steam (and even more than that when I played this game before I had steam) I am far from over this game. It's like a sport you can always get slightly better it's almost impossible to master. Even once you can beat the computer on hardest - somebody online will beat you.   Works great on steam. If you're a strategy fan you must have this.
This game has ruined my life!
"Fun Fun Fun.  I ruined my study playing this game around 2001. It;s still awesome and old skool. Yes, I know you probably bought the original version five times because of failing cd-roms. Buying the steam version'll fix this problem.   By the way, the HD isn't showing off at all. so, DON'T buy this game if your original cd is still working."
Best strategy game.
It's friggen Age of Empires 2!
"I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys RTS and creating massive armies and battling well known civilizations from the course of history.   The only thing would be to make it possible to play online in the Pacific Region. I don't mean New Zealand and Australia, but Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia etc. It is just far too slow.   Apart from that, Age of Empires 2 has been a favourite for many years."
"None of the Slavik units say '♥♥♥♥♥', but I suppose this will be rectified with a patch.  10/10, would lose a horde of Boyars to enemy monk spam again."
Over a decade since its original release and still going strong. An enduring classic now in HD.
"a great classic that most of all is a 'return to' game. A game that you play oover and over again for just a 'quick' skirmish battle, only to see that it has already taken you over an hour and you haven't even attacked a single enemy yet."
"Out of all the games that I've played - I have to say that this one is among the greatest, if not the greatest. No, the graphics won't compare to your latest AAA game - even with this HD edition, but if our childhoods are any indication, we know that this doesn't matter.   If you've never played and RTS before, start with this one. It's easy enough to grasp fairly quickly, and the fact that the game deals a fair amount with history makes it feel a little more real, and a bit less abstract: You need wood to build homes and structures, along with stone. You need gold to pay for soldiers and fund research. You need food to feed people. It's all very direct, very simple, and incredibly fun and addicting.   If it's on sale, buy it immediately and load it up. You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you leave it in your library, unplayed.   "
The most awesome and greatest game ever in history!!!
I was so happy seing this game on steam! I loved playing it when I was a kid and im gonna love playing it today!!!
"I have been playing the AOE franchise for the majority of my life. I first saw my sister's husband play this game when I was about 11 years old and I think it was the reason I can say I am a gamer to this day. I was inspired to build my first PC for this game as the only thing I had at the time was 486 POS that wouldn't run anything worth playing. After many months of saving every little bit of money I could, I built a badass Pentium 166 that could run the original AOE. I probably put 2000 hours into that game at the very least.   But this is a review for AOE 2, isn't it? As soon as I knew this was coming out, I had it firmly in my radar. I picked it up immediately and put several thousand more hours into it. It was great then and it is even better now. The new campaigns, the HD upgrade, the old stuff, it is all here and epic as hell. There isn't much I can say about the gameplay, story, and mechanics that hasn't already been said. It game is perfection. I just absolutely love it and I think anyone who is into RTS games has to play this game.   10/10 A must have for any steam library."
A spectacular game with a learning curve but enjoyable nonetheless
A very nice game with some educational history lessons !
"I would guess that for most of my life some version of this game has been on my computer at this point. Its an old friend to me. A lover even. Oh its good to have you back, my sweet."
"If you like battle, strategy and treason, the game for you"
"It's Age of Empires II, remade. What else can I say but prepare to face the endless onslaught of the Mayan army?"
This is without a doubt my favorite age of empires. I have spent countless hours of my life in this game. In fact I grew up playing this game but was lost to me for a great number of years untill I found steam. The only thing I wish is they would put the original age of empires up for It was a close second and a challenging one on top of it. I have found that since I started playing agian I am alot better at this game just from the intellect I have gained growing up. Now after beeting this one I would like to beat the original
"I heard the best review from this game talking in relation to todays economics and religion, but have to say childhood and forever favourite game. If you have read this review, most likely you have played it if you are born 95- so yes its for everyone and educational :)"
"Having never played the original, I can say this classic stands the test of time. Interface is a bit confusing, but the main actions are context sensetive."
Learnt more from this game than I did in History in school for 11 years.  MLGs are missiong out on the ruby in a sandstorm of games out there.
"-Pick Spain  -Spam Villagers to maximum population limit  -gather an endless amount of resources -develop Loom + Supremacy  -Stop collectiong stuff and send entire population towards enemy  -Laugh at your enemies as they watch helplessly their whole army of knights in shining armor getting annihilated by a mob of dirty, angry villagers armed with knifes  -realise all your villagers died trying to burn down a stone castle -&gt; doesn't matter, you got tons of resources  -research sappers this time &gt;.&gt; -release your new legion of villagers upon the enemy  -Enjoy their suffering &gt;:D "
Good real time strategy Easy to play with friends 
A good sequel to the original-The graphics are a 3D like 2D. Good Gameplay... But if you love very graphicly intensive games with excelent graphics this is not for you. The game is a bit old but yet it is still worthy of being a good game. I reccomend this game.
"Classic, In HD!"
"Love this game! brings back so many memories, good HD remake :D"
A big improvement to an already great game
A timeless RTS game in a new beautiful HD release!
"I've been playing Age of Empires 3 for years, and decided to buy this one to replay it, in honor of the countless hours of my youth this game burned. And my God, it is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible, compared to the joke AoE3 is in comparison.  I recommend this game, especially if you enjoy being beaten to a pulp."
Great game!
Best old school RTS for adventure fun!
Just as good as i remembered it.
"This game is awesome, the skill it takes to play is cool."
Addicting version of Civilization for Windows 96.
One of the grandfathers of RTS games. Don't disrespect your elders. Buy it now!
"Good work missed this, play with all my old mates like we did when we were in school"
gud game!!! very gud game!!!! much wow  i am gud at building thing now thanks obama care 
Just a great classic game. So glad that steam decided to have this game available because I lost my discs and wouldn't have been able to play again unless I went to look for a downloadable version. Even though the graphics are outdated it is still an amazing game to play either alone or with your friends.
242.8 hours played and stil loving it.
"Just like the good'ol days, but better. I played far too much of this game in the past, and now it's in HD. I don't know what else could be better than that. Perhaps if I could find some decent multiplayer matches that don't end 10 minutes in with the opponent ditching. Oh well, crushing AI works as well. Tally ho!"
"This game was quite the impact on me as a child. I have bought this game numerous times over the years and finally now it is safe in my STEAM library FOR-EV-ER!!!   The HD upgrade for the game does require some cpu power if you put the settings up and have a lot of AI counterparts to battle. Love that they up'd the population as well. The first time I played I was trying with much difficulty to build the army as large as I could, because once I hit 200 back in the olden days I was sweeping across the map with my massive paladin army to destroy the silly AI.   Cheers and Thanks to all involved in bringing this to steam.   Oh yeah and my AP history classes back in highschool thought I was this huge history buff due to this game teaching me about the ancient days. Thank you for giving me an awesome amount of historical knowledge in an entertaining setting."
a classic. the graphic changes is in my memory not much of an improvement but back in the day ones imagination made better graphics than that which you can get today anyway. The game itself its wonderful. age of empires can stand on its long reputation regardless of any reviews here
Classic.  But uncontrollable resolution problem with laptops.
A classic given a facelift FANTASTIC!!
"The fact that aoe2 is one of the best strategy games out there, since its release before 16+ years ago its preety sad. RTS genre has died, aoe2 is keeping alive the spirit!"
"A very good game, still love it in 2016"
"The new update is bad. I can't just save a game in single player under whatever I want? It says it needs a code in it?  None of the cheat codes are working either.   I also can't seem to find the button to turn off the mouse being able to move the viewing window around. It's really irritating.   It's still a good game, but those flaws weren't there before."
"the game is awesome, the fogotten campaign looks like some rookie created it and valve decided to sell it, affrican kingdoms definetly worth buying ;)"
"What a great game, i have spent many hours playing the age of empires series, even throughtout my younger years to today i still love picking up where i left off, i would have to say that the first age of empires will always be my most favorite of the series, the developers need to go back to that style of simplicity in my opinion, either way, if you havent played AoE i highly recommend giving this one a shot before trying any other AoE games, if you have a copy of the original AoE even better.  MRFOURTWENTY APPROVED. ~_~"
"Childhood relived in HD, never stopped loving this game!"
No patch fixing the lagging-issues in sp. 3 years after realse. wanted to have massive battles againt the ai with my friend but spikes destroys the expirence
This game has some good memories...
Absolutly love this game. Have played for over a decade and can never get enough. Its just one of those games that grow on ya and always have a place in your heart.
Great game! Looking forward for the new expansions!
you know what this is and you know it's great
"Great gameplay. Great campaigns. Nice multiplayer. Many enjoyable maps.This is one of my most played games. This game is the reason that got me into appreciating the History subject and it had taught me many interesting things like how does a tiny nation of squabbling Mongolian tribes came to conquer a vast majority of Asia, how the New World was founded by Erik the Viking and how did a small army of Henry V prevailed against a large army of the French at the battle of Agincourt. Age of empires 2, in my opinion,should not be a very positive users' reviewed game. It should be overwhelmingly positive. I recommend it to any RTS players and I(although this might be a biased review) rate it 10 out of 10."
"Great game, fond memories from my childhood"
"Important things I've learned from Age of Empires:  If you want to win a war the most important people to kill are civilians. To put out a fire you send your civilians to repair it with a hammer. Civilians live for the sole purpose of the war effort. To save on resources make sure all your civilians and soldiers wear the same clothes as their equals and eat the exact same amount of food. No more, no less.  Units that blow themselves up are an excellent strategy for taking out castles. Trees make an impenetrable wall if you don't cut them down. A villager in some obscure corner of the map can be your salvation or your doom. Archers are also alchemists and change their gold into food. Only villagers get to collect food from hunted beasts. Villagers burn lots of calories and eat a little less than a knight and his horse combined (a mere 20% less).  10/10 Would learn again."
I have been a fan of this game since day one. I played it on the PC with the disc I bought since 2000! The updated version is excellent! Adding the 'unlocks' for the different civilizations is one thing I always thought was missing. I my mind it is THE greatest game of all time. I've loved every second that I've spent on it. Thanks for keeping this game alive and to continue to add new civilizations to it. As they say in the game 'Fight On!'
"Great multiplayer, Haven't really touched the singleplayer that much, Love the progression + KILL ALL THE GOATS 8/10 Strategy"
A classic RTS staple that just can't be beat 8.5/10
"Problem with the graphic sometimes, it's a good game nonetheless."
Great for reliving childhood glories... IT IS GOOD TO BE THE KING OF THE LOSERS
"This game is tons of fun. Strategy with lots of different maps, armies, and levels. Playing with friends is especially fun."
"It is excellent. I give it high marks when played among friends, having meaningful campaign, multiplayer and DLC (Conquerers expansion."
"Hell yeeeeeeeeeeeeah!   This game was the mad notes back in the early 2000's and you know what? It still is. A modding/map building community that's still alive and well. Plenty of people to still play with. If you're anything like me then your childhood was filled with lan parties. I remember playing Counter Strike, day of defeat, ricochet, Halo 2, DOTA allstars, and Age 2 with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of friends and family. Every week. Age 2 HD is still fun, and still better than Age 3. Plenty of people still play it online. I play the game with my cousin pretty much everytime we end up in the same place at the same time. 10/10 still playing fine."
"A classic RTS game that is apparently still alive and well, getting the much-needed windowed mode enhancement, as well as continued support. The fact that there are now 2 more expansion packs (Forgotten and African Kingdoms; and that's on top of the original Conquerors expansion pack that comes with the HD Edition), as of this review, which aren't just mere DLC (there's a difference between the 2 terms), adds more to an already timeless game.  Time to get medieval on some people."
"Its AOE nuff said.  Its ai is one of the best in the RTS genra. In the regards to the fact that they don't seam like they are cheating to beat you. And by cheating I mean that instade of facing one player as in real life. You are facing a team of at least 6 players. The Forgotten expension adds this in though, so I would never recommend that one. It also amkes the ai for more likly to just resign if you are domenating them at all. But the new Units and civs from it is a welcome site. Which brings me to; And this game is still geting extra content!"
"Besides graphics, it's the exact same gameplay from 1999 that everyone loved"
"the game is very bad because it is lag, and player there verry rude player idiot"
"Great update, well worth it especially if you can find it on sale. So much nostalgia."
"Its clearly F#ckn Sick C#nt, I mean if you look at it, they are still making S#it for it. Ergo, Therefore: F@ckn Sick"
"5/5, Revived oldschool :)"
best oldscholl game ever. i wish i could play it native on my mac...
This game is amazing. if you like rts games set in the medieval era then stop reading this and just buy it!
"I grew up on age of empires, so to find this game again just made my day. It's apparently got better graphics, I really cant tell, but if you're anything like me with Age of Empires, you don't give a damn about graphics and you'll just love the game. I think it's a good starting point for anyone who's new to the idea of strategy games, and there's a ton of replayability. The campaigns are a hoot, the skirmishes are wonderful, and with the right friends multiplayer is absolutely barbaric."
all u hav 2 do is make farms n build stuf its so gud lol
Awesome game! Tons of fun to play with friends! Lots of different ways to win and different empires. I recommend.
Since childhood I have played this great game and let me tell you it is one of the best games I've played in my life and the best RTS I've ever played. Now with this HD version we can play this legendary title to large resolutions like those with screens today.
Pick berries get wood build stuff
.
"Played this game since i was a kid, now, they even have the HD !"
"Very cool game, back then i played it on my PS2 and I sucked rly hard now i still do but in HD."
Great game!
Possibly the best strategy game of all time!
All time classic! A must-have for real time strategy lovers.
"9/10 overall good game but recently multipleyer keeps going out of sync, microsoft fix this !!!"
"In my opinion one of the greatest games on Steam and also one of the greatest games ever. Its simple enough that anyone can pick up, play and have fun but also has a super competitive strategic side to it for veteran players who will continue to learn and pick up little tricks. I've been playing this game for over 12 years and there is still lots of tiny little things I'm learning (such as garrisoning 10 hand cannoneers in a Teuton bombard tower makes it fire 2 cannon balls instead of 1).  This game works on every level. The single player campaigns are fun and surprisingly educational. 1v1, 4v4 games are super competitive and borderline a sport and then there is the FFA diplo/regicide games that are just amazing with friends or anyone of all skill levels to play together looking to have a good time. The custom maps and mods in the workshop just add even more to a game that was already amazing to begin with. I recommend this game to everyone."
"Again, so much nostalgia. A good slower paced strategy game."
Excellent expansions of the classic beloved strategy game.
"Epic strategy that is challenging today as it was years ago, if you wish to learn history, enjoy a great strategy game and conquer the world, this game is a MUST."
Best RTS game ever. Highly recommended 10/10.
"All time favourite. But some recommendations to this game is needed. The icon of resources should match the informations of buildings, researches and units."
"The first time i played this game was in 1999 and i had 09 years old. Since then never forget about this game and when i saw it's release, i rejoyced my self. I bought the game without think twice. The game is excelent, 10/10. This game made my childhood and keeps giving me happyness. I play with friends in parties of 08 and when we are playing there is no more friendship, especially when there is a stone mine in discussion. The game worths every penny and more. The best game to play with friends."
"After being forced onto Steam to learn how to play games by my game-crazy boyfriend, I found that this is the only game I can so far sit and play several hours playing without getting immensly frustrated and turning it off.  Thoroughly enjoyable."
"5/5, Revived oldschool :)"
best oldscholl game ever. i wish i could play it native on my mac...
"Age of Empires II HD is an extremely fun and classic strategy game.  It offers a large selection of singleplayer campaigns and its multiplayer is very fun with friends. You build up huge armies, thriving towns and defenses to keep the enemies at bay. The workshop also adds to the game with the oppurtunity to battle on player created warzones.  It's tagged with the 'HD' in the title but it's not really a massive graphical improvement from the original 1999 release. It's pretty much the only con that this game has but don't let it fool you.  I don't usually play a lot of strategy games but this game still appeals to me and has encouraged me to try other strategy games. If that isn't a good reason to buy this game, I'm going to have to destroy your castle. I recommend this game."
"Crashes in multiplayer like every 2nd time. Always some network connection issues. Not only at my pc, but also on friends. Bad coding. After so many years bugs are still not fixed?"
Words can't do AOEII justice.
Great game
"For some leaders, losing 50 buildings in a single session would be a crushing defeat - as long as you have wood and villagers you will carry on.  10/10 unlock Phoenix Rising achievement again"
Wo lolo.... Now you want to buy the game
"Amazing. Nothing makes me happier than rehashing 1998 with a computer and internet that is 100x faster (and everyone else, too).  Seriously, though. Bring back the isometric 2D RTS games!"
"AoE II was one of my favorite strategy games to play as a kid. Sure I didn't really understant what exactly was happing at the time, it was awesome to relive those memories now that I now came across it again on steam. It's challenging, fun, and I dont believe it will ever get old. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is new to strategy games or even those who are more experienced. Double thumbs up"
"Best, Forever the Best. Love it so much. :) you should buy even if it's a old game. it has big community"
The classic RTS game and units k.o. the moment they are converted 4/5. The DLC content still needs some working though
"Thank you for bringing this game back, the nostalgia and memories are priceless. Funny how a game this old still provides hours of fun.  - (Unit AI needs to be improved)"
Even after a few years since Age of empires II came out its stilll an amazing game; especially when you are playing with friends.
"Awesome old game I played when I was young. Playing it again in HD is real fun! Also with the steam workshops and addons, voice chat etc. this is the best!"
Wololo
greatest tactical game
Epic... Simply the best!
One of the best strategy games i have played.
very disappointed. very glitchy. gl to the people that buy the expacs
"When I was a young lad, I was first given this game. Since then, I have molded into a human cyborg. One with the game. Alternatively, the game has taught me as much as I have taught it. emag eht htiw enO. Now, I weep in victory as my foes fall to their knees, where I, the champion, penetrate the fears of the elderly in order to one day unit human cyborgs and humans. Needless to say this game is a-f***ing-mazing."
"A classic, now polished and remastered. There's not a lot to say, really. If you've played the original version, then there's only good things to say about some of the new features. Steam Workshop integration is wonderful, and the new, long-awaited expansions only add to the unique feeling of a mixture between nostalgic and new."
"been playing this game since I was like 10 years old, it's epic... play it unless you're an idiot."
one of the best games
"Great game. Loved it when I was a kid, still love it."
"the story narration audio that was there in Age of empires II, Campaigns is missing.. and that is why the single player is not as per the standard.. It feels as if the crux of the story is missing"
30
"Guide to winning a game of AoE2:- 1)Set the game to land map, starting in post imperial age, deathmatch. 2)Pick Goths 3)Swarm the enemy like you're the Zerg 4)Wonder why no-one plays with you :(  Yes, is gud gaem..."
Great Game!
"What can I say, a pretty fun game and with very exciting story lines on the campaign and great to play with multi players. Of course, like any other game, there will by people who ruins some experience but that is only on rare occasions. This game rely on strategy, alleys, and most important of them all, your own army and civilization. Giving this 10/10 :3"
The game you loved when you were a kid ... now in HD !!!!
"Still one if not THE best RTS ever made. All available on Steam with even more stuff than the original.  If you have played and loved this before, no doubt you'll love it again!  If you have never played AoE-II before and you like this genre, it's a must try! (Don't even compare this to AoE-III...please)"
"If you have an AMD VGA and are having issues, new drivers fixed it.  Other than that... If you dont know this game. You should. If you do know this game. You should be playing it.  Nostalgia magic aside, this game holds up reaaaaly well. Lovable disctinct factions (kingdoms), great mix of units, counters, possible cheese plays. Ruthless and funny multiplayer experience.   Havent noticed any flaws (other than the fixed ati/amd thing) except for mouse clicks not registering sometimes on the UI ingame. Barely noticable.  Up there (still) with forged alliance, wc3 and the like in my books."
"Awesome game. This is a nuetral review but steam doesnt alow it so ill put it in the positive section.  This game is awesome, huge battles, town mangement and its semi realistic... But the thing is you can just buy the origional copy for cheaper than 20 dollars. And the African kingdoms is just a retexured version of the game and is alot of money. The game is glitchy and theres alot of lag.  I would recomend this game for entertainment but I cant see myself playing anymore"
I remember when I was 7. This is the first game that I really enjoyed. This game teach you history. Even more with the expansion pack. 
If you want a nice single-player experience then this game is for you. If you want to play with friends look elsewhere because the MP is a laggy mess.
After all this time? -Always.
It's like being 10 again but actually knowing what you're doing this time around. Definate purchase.
"Absolute classic enhanced enough to be playable 16 years after it's first release, totally amazed that we have Steam workshop mods for it as well."
The BEST game of all time!
"Best game on steam, 10/10 would recommend"
"No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I focus, no matter how many pro players I watch and learn, I CANNOT beat the new AI on Moderate.  I'd get rekt by the new AI and be forever known as a peasant, casual scrub again! 1337\420 - ign"
"I suck at thiis game, but I like being bad at this game"
Childhood redefined in HD.
Where are all my ♥♥♥♥♥s at? they aint no brothas in this poopy dikk game i r8 $/♥♥♥
this game ruin friendships
its good
This game has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. Still remember getting up early for school as a kid just to play a random map game. Geez this game is intense.
"steam error #41.  im still try to figure out what in the hell happen to me ?  still, 8/10 plaing this O'l game"
I absolutely adore this game &gt;^w^&lt;  This was the game that introduce me to so many wonderful things &lt;3
"This is a really fun game.I mostly play Multiplayer with my friends, as we usually battle each other or bots, depending on how many of us there are. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone "
  7/10
Annoyingly addictive.
Wololo/10   Would Wololo again.
"Well made, addictive, well recognized skirmish platform. Missions are not really amusing."
After the african kingdoms expanction Im having trouble playing games with my friends. Is this a General problem or spacific to me? But in general I love this game and would rate it but. Multiplayer needs a ♥♥♥♥ing fix.
Halp I can't stop playing this :(
"Sit back with a classic, a re-fashioned, classic that is!"
The original was better. In adding a few uninspired campagins they've ruined the pathfinding. This is rubbish.
"Classic! Old, but Gold. And with remastered graphics."
Rules to play this game  1.17++ 2.No Kids 3.Always stay in 2000 4.Patience 5.Dont Be Mad  I Fail in Rules Number 5
played for weeks still not finish nice gameplay
"I've been playing Age of Empires ever since I was a kid, and I have to say that this HD remake is not a dissapointment. It actually adds on to the already astounding gameplay by offering the Steam Workshop addons, and multiplayer with your friends. It's totally worth the money, and will suck hours of your life away as you build a kingdom from scratch or play as El Cid and kill everyone. In my own opinion, AOE 2 is better than any others in the series, so get this one before you drop the dough on 3."
"It would a great game, if it worked on mac"
"Oh nostalgia. You can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Age of Empires 2 was always and will probably always be my favorite RTS of all time. But I was a child when I first played it and have been spoiled by good graphics. The game hasn't really changed since I played it as a kid for better or worse. Sure, the graphics may be better, but it's so ungodly slow paced compared to games today. I played a few campaigns and felt like it took me ages. If this game released today the way that it looks now and didn't collect from the nostalgia players, I would not recommend this. However, since only the nostalgia players will play this, I'm going to give this 5 whatevers out of 10. (I can't believe I just rated my favorite RTS of all time a 5)"
10/10 Kids from the 90s would buy!
would sell my sister for this. &lt;&lt; the mark of a good game.
Old but gold
how can i run the game on MAC?  
"Grew up with this game. Very nostalgic! The game runs good.   1. Build your armies and cities for hours 2. Run out of stone and gold 3. Use cheats to spawn cars secretely 4. Partner with a friend and kill the other friend 5. Use your cars to elimate the remaing friend  9/10, would spawn cars to kill the friend of my friend"
I play this game from my childhood. Still I'm playing.   Reason may be we like to be KINGs one day...  we can't plan cities or armies like this in real life. 
"Most amazing, historically accurate, and replayable game I have ever enjoyed. This game defined a great part of my childhood, and instilled in me an interest in learning."
"I once had Age of Empires III and thought Two would be great. It is great even with some glitches but awesome-r with interest Aztec, Mayan, Korea and Huns. Would Like to get expansion. The battle combat is awesome has more options than AoE III.   Glitches occurred Fishing Dock on land. Click to place a building and build was not placed (I just place the building again in the same spot) Villager button might/might not work (Most times it works, on rare occasion it didn't whilst looking at a lazy worker) "
Hard and expanded. I love it.
A classic RTS and arguably the best in the series.   8.5/10
"I'm not a big fan of RTSs, but this old classic still holds up. If you look beyond the graphics, this is a real fun way to spend a few hours."
Pretty solid HD version of an extremely solid childhood game.  I don't think it's worth the full price if you already owned AoE2 though. I got it for 5€ and it's more than enough for me.  Have fun !
"My childhood game~ :3 Also, that moment when you can convert the enemy's Gate~ XD"
This was one of the best strategy games I played as a kid. Versing my brother and friends in Death matches was always fun. Still love the cheat to turn birds into dogs wearing capes and stone walls catching fire.  Wololo Wololo Wololo
"♥♥♥♥ YES, IT'S BACK!"
10 elephants can fit in a transport boat but 11 archers cant. 11/10
Hark! My childhood calls onto thee! Buy this masterpiece of the ages! The Settlers Dream! The Calvaries Templar! The Kings Fortress!
Best castle building sim 2k15 10/10 would spam again
"One of the best games I have played, I remember installing this onto the school computers back in the day playing for hours. With the new release of the AoE HD brings back a much loved and played game back onto modern computers."
"I love that they're still making updates for this game! Keep it up 10/10 from me btw, this game is my childhood"
"only problem with this game is on standard game, if you dont team up with someone you have an huge problem with gold, and also the chost to make units is terrible expensive unless if you make only pikemen and spearmen and scout units, and also the walls are a bit to weak even if you upgrade it. but ts a ton of fun thoe."
great game. lots of freeze frames. Steam claims its my computer graphics but i can play call of duty on my computer flawlessly and i cant play a game that was originally windows 95? BULL
"This is like the best strategy game ever going HD! Not to mention the other improvements like the population limits, etc. Also, seems like they have removed the Easy difficulty so that makes it really difficult."
AoE2 promises a lot of fun to casual players and those who seek a challenge. The community is friendly and there are many opportunitys to start a pvp game on a noob level 9/10
"This is an old game but a goody, fairly cheap to buy and has had loads of changes for the better. I get very addicted to building a village and destroying others for some reason. Its a game that you can stop and save to carry on another day or if your like me, clear out a whole day on your diary to finish whichever campaign you may be on. There are first time p[aying campaigns that teach you along the way how to play. The harder a level is the faster that level goes. Its a game I recommend. Happy Gaming."
awesome game a great classic
I'm in love with this game. The flowing hills bring me joy as I continue to produce aids cells with my pikman3. That game is great btw.
"Amazing game :D I've loved it since I was a wee lad ;) ...But lately, the gameplay has gone down in quality after some Steam updates to the game. I've noticed that units on and off have issues with routing, and very often do they end up crowding around doorways, backing up the entire line during a battle... the timer function is gone now, so I can't tell how long I've been in a match... and the interface for Standard games (single) went from decent to drab... if possible, the game quality went backwards! ...What's going on, mate?  Other than that... the game has remarkable replayability, and is exciting to play both on and offline. For the beginner though, you may win every single player match... but you'll get destroyed online unless you come up with unconventional strategies. From experience, I managed to master the hardest difficulty with multiple computers against me... but my first online match ended in frustrating. From monk armies, to single unit flooding... a game can end in the first 5 minutes, or somewhere in the realm of 6 hours.   10/10 one of my favourite games... despite frustrating updates that, I feel, are tanking the quality of experience."
"The HD version is definitely worth grabbing, especially if you're like me and played the original as a kid. Learn to play against others and you'll have a whole lot of fun!"
"This has always been a very entertaining, challenging RTS combat and development game. The new AIs are WAY better, and its far easier to play with friends across the internet than it used to be before game devs really thought about the internet. Cooperative against AIs or PvP are both fun. Highly playable oevr and over."
The nostalgia is real!
"Amazing Game, Stratigic, Fun, and a Chance to get at your friends and make them rage"
"So, Age of Empires was my first game. I played it when I were 7 years old and I followed all his process at 2015. What I can say about this game is that it's one of the bests RTS games at the moment. The soundtrack and the graphics are better, but the best part of the game. In my opinion is that Steam made the community of mods that suddenly turned the game much better. But the real engine of the game is working like the gold and old game. I mean you don't have any lost of quality at now, Steam put all the things together (mods, multiplayer, exp) and it works pretty good. Although it's one only thing that makes me sad in this game, 2 exp realized (forgotten and now Africa) but nor one of the both could remake or implement more things in the engine of the game (something that makes us fans surprised for example put the units in the walls) I didn't see that yet. This is what makes me sad about the game, we don't see much updates in the pure engine. We just see more civilizations(ok it's good too but not for now). Even if we have this problem, the games keep been awesome and fun. I know that old codes are hard to edit, but it's what we,the fans, want.... this is my opinion about this awesome game."
I am glad I bought this game because it confirmed that I was not being nostalgic about my childhood; this is in fact a great game.
Nostalgia. Plus the satisfaction of stealing a unit from your enemy and turning them against them xD
"Playing this game gave me so many memories when i was young, this HD version just made me remember them"
10/10. Works great in Steam + PlayOnLinux. One minor bug is that some hotkeys stop working if you minimize + maximize the game window.
"A really old classic that I just adore.  P.S If anyone can help me with this.  The game seems really zoomed in than my ps2 version, is there anyway to zoom out a bit in order to see more?"
Great game!!
Old but still a good game
"This game is amazing, i used to play it in my old pc with crappy graphics, and now with the remastering is so much enjoyable, the online is pretty ok so don't doubt to play it if you have a friend who owns it!"
"Do I recommend Age of Empires 2? Yes. It's an awesome game with awesome music.  Do I recommend buying AoE2 HD if you already own AoE2? ...Not so much. This Steam version features widescreen support, steamworks integration, and many bug fixes, but still crashes and lags seemingly randomly in multiplayer.  Edit: I can now safely say that although the game still lacks LAN support (a bummer), the crashes and lag have largely been dealt with."
Totaly love it !!!!! I highly recommend this game ! better than Age of empires III in all : ) 
"I have been playing this game since 2002 - 2003, When I was only 7 or 8 year old!   Because I have been playing since a small age, This game gives me lots of euphoric feelings. It started my interest in reading about History and old age civilizations and peoples life in them.  The Campaign mode is Sheer Perfection! The Hisotry, The Story, The Art, The Voice Acting and then ofcourse the gameplay. It really emmerses you in history and you truly feel like for example Gengis Khan conquring the world! :)  Ofcourse after becoming a bit older and once again trying this game I have realized that there is great Stategy involved in playing this. Now I normally play with friends on multiplayer.   One has to make many quick and early decisions that will mould how the later gameplay will be. One has to learn all the strengths and weaknesses of each civilization. One has to plan how to raise an army, how to Launch an attack, how to create diversions. How to use stealth and how to manage time.. one has to be thinking about all of these factors even before the match starts.   In the end, if you play casual or competitive either way you will not be dishartened. Its a game that will keep you immeresed into it for atleast 2 hours (per game).  Happy Conquering !"
Best game ever! From 2000s to now!
"I have been playing Age of Empires since I was old enough to read a history book. All nostalgia aside, I highly recommend this game if you are a strategy gamer. Its rock-paper-scissors style makes building the proper army more important. In addition, the A.I. is really agressive. I keep losing on moderate, but that's probably due to my lack of offensive strategy. A good defense is the best offense; unless they have five trebuchets, that is."
"I am extremely satified with the HD version of the game. This hands down is the best Age of Empires version ever made. 1 was fun but lacked specifics such as finding idle villagers. AoE III is just completely different with controls, videos throughout the game, etc. Have a copy of III and played it maybe 3-4 times. Now with AoE II, I have been playing for more than 15yrs and play it more than any other game I own. I love it. I also got sick of buying disk after disk. I have at least 5 copies of 1, and 2 for fear that the would stop making the game. Sure enough, out of no where, a downloadedable copy from Steam was made available. Thanks Steam!!!!"
Great upgrade of the game - works even under windows 10 AI seems much improved as it is harder to beat the computer now
"Old but still GOLD, Best Real Time Strategy and based real history game ever!"
This game bring back so many memories. It still is awesome and as fun to play as it was when it was released.
Anyone can help? When I click play button from the launcher it keeps not responding. Why??? I'm using Windows 10 to play it. I need help! 
:)
"I have played 70 hours of this game on two weeks! And I'm saying I loving it. From the units and buildings to the diffrent civilisation. They have taken the originaly game and made it into HD. In reality they have given us more.  They who has this game mabye also have the Forgotten Empires DLC, who added in five more civs to the original Age of Kings and the Conquerors, and a plecter of new units, buildings, heroes and other stuff. They have also a new skins, the east european and the mediteranian, to the Forgotten Empires civs. And five more campaigns!  And now. We have the African Kingdom. I have been hyped for it and it's beutiful. It adds new skins and units. Chek it out."
"Okay, this game is mostly nostalgia for me back when it basically came free verson on Windows 98 (At least it was when I bought that computer) and completely fell in love with the game. You build a town, have villagers gather raw material to build walls and train soldiers, build to the next age and fight with the CPU. You can play campaigns with others online or lan (although, I've never tried). Loved the game then, and still love the game now. It has been a while since I last played it, so the story line of the different campaigns are unrecollectable (Actually, I think it is one of the few games I didn't read any of the instructions or storyline when I played it..too impatient to start building my castle and fortress to care i think)."
Those god damn monks keeps stealing my sh*t..
"Great game, great singleplayer."
"This game is great and is worth getting even at full price, I picked mine up for $4 luckly. Also I may only have about 3 hours on my account but I played over 100 hours of the original (non HD) version of this game."
only thing i can say about this game is- OLD IS GOLD... only AOE lovers can get me...
"I thought the AI lost its ability to use formations while moving its units in Standard Games. Then I found the option that changes AI types. Who would've guessed that the Original AI was the AI from the original version. Then I saw that population limits went over 200.  I don't like the ends of the southern facing cliffs--they're too abrupt. That makes them more difficult to blend with the terrain. It makes them sharp and ugly. The worst thing is the new cliff edges.  Also, I haven't found a way to change the screen size/resolution.  The best things are the increased versatility with terrain brushes in the campagin editor, the 3Dish flowing water, and the new population caps. And there's no CD required."
An absolute classic. I played this game so much as a kid and now I am nostalgia-ing over it so much. AOE 2 is a cornerstone of the RTS genre.
:)
"I loved this game, one of the first game I played. So you could imagine the excitement I had when I found out about the new Forgotten DLC and HD remake and everyuthing (this was a good couple years ago), and I quickly bought the game and throuroughly enjoyed it again.  When the African Kingdoms came out I was again, excited. Unfortunately, since African Kingdoms release, the game has not worked outside of the campaigns and I apparently do not have any DLC's, including the Conquerors!!!!  So I am sorry, what was once a great game is now a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥, and the developers dont even seem to want to fix it. Suppose thats how the world works nowadays in the gaming industry, you buy a game that doesnt work and the devs just up and leave because they've made their money, why should the continue.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT HAS BEEN PATCHED BY A NEW DEVELOPMENT TEAM WHO ARENT ♥♥♥♥ING USELESS!!!!!!!!!"
"After playing hundreds of hours of the original release of Age of Empires 2, plus its Conquerors expansion, it was very exciting to see a re-release of the game. The 'HD' remake supports widescreen and higher resolution monitors than the classic, so it displays well on modern hardware. Out of the box, the game uses nearly all of the original textures leading to some players' disapointment with the 'HD' moniker. Workshop support is available to add better visuals to a degree, but the game retains its antiquated appearance. Love that, or hate it.  Multiplayer mode is active enough to find matches easily. There exist a few AI mods to augment the already revamped stock AI. This spices up single player campaigns.  There also exist two DLC expansions, namely The Forgotten, and The African Kingdoms. Each adds content to both the single- and multi-player sides of the game. Players without the expansion content can still play with a rotating pool of its content.  Age of Empires has always been a personal favourite franchise. While gameplay-wise this re-release doesn't add anything to the original, technically speaking it's a great remastering. Works with modern hardware, supports community content, online matches while behind a router (NAT) work well, and it plays fantastically."
Everything I loved growing up is back. Love playing it!
I played this game alot when I was younger. This remastery is well worth the price and gives hours of new gameplay through dlcs and new races.
"A game I played ever since I was a toddler, Age of Empires. Back then, I knew it as, 'The Man Game.' I loved it very much. I usually would make my own maps where I would set up arenas and have my men fight different types of units. I remember in AoE Rise of Rome, I had an entire battle between soldiers and lions. It was amazing. This may just be completely bias here, but I LOVE this game and strongly recomend you get this."
"Amazing Game, Stratigic, Fun, and a Chance to get at your friends and make them rage"
This game is so good
"An excellent buy, this game is by far my most played game on steam. Anyone who likes RTS games should play this game if they have not already, and even many other RTS gamers could benefit from this game. Overall, a 5/5, especially considering this game can be used to play on voobly as well!"
So glad to have picked this up. Used to play it all the time when it first came out but with the rework of it in HD I had to repurchase it again. Well worth playing and its easy to lose hours too.
Childhood returns in HD and Steam Workshop support.
"Great game, one of my all time favorites of all time. Updated right. Looks pretty."
"Classic RTS given new life on Steam with texture upgrades, mods via Steam Workshop, and brand new expansions."
Its a MUST have
Fix the framdrop issues...  Im not gonna play this game when even the tutorial drops to 0-10 fps...
"Oh, Age of Empires. What a history we have together.   I remember playing the original game back when it was released in 1997 when I was very young. One of my very first computer games. I still even have the original disc that still runs on this pc. Thousands of hours have been spent on this franchise.   But enough reminiscing. This is an excellent HD remake of an excellent game. If you are an rts fan, pick up this improved upon classic.  8.3/10"
this game makes me feel old :3
I played it a long time ago ... So many good memories associated with it! And now she's in HD !!! I advise everyone !!!
Took me straight back to my early days!
"0/5, the game is unplayable because of lag every 5-10 seconds. Tried to play the game with friend and game freezes after 10 mins playing. Hope the lag issue will be solved soon...  (120 mb/s down, 50 mb/s up..)  Aspidov"
"Pros: -ah that classic nostalgia -great brand new features and countries dlc -the old cheatcodes still work -wololololooo Cons: -not all that historically/culturally accurate -too expensive unless bought on sale (I got it and all dlc for 12, that's a fair price) with some exceptions country units and buildings are all the same. Aztecs and Koreans can get mostly the same basic units, that makes no sense.  -voice acting is terrible, albeit better than reading their tiny character scripts  -AI isn't varied in strategy (example they only produce the same 3 units over and over) -if you're country is from Africa, why are you white? 'Oh my god Karen you can't just ask someone why they're white.'"
"Same, but different. But still the same :)"
"This is one of the best RTS's ever made. A remastered version was even better. Playing this game on a modern machine has never been easier and even having new content added to the game keeps it alive. Also having the Steam Workshop adds a great amount of content.   If I had one thing to say however that needs to be fixed, should be the multiplayer. That's all I have to say about the game. If you do not have it already, GET IT NOW!"
"God, this game brings back so many excellent memories. Age of Empires has been a part of my life for a long time. It's how I got into the RTS strategy genre, and to see it thriving to this day is a testament to its depth and unique feel. If you haven't played this game, you definitely should give it a go. The strategical depth of this game is pretty astounding; from the map choice to the civilization you choose to the management of your economy, every moment and decision is a critical one. But that isn't to say it's hard to learn. In fact, I think one of the beautiful things about this game is how easy it is to learn and how difficult (but rewarding) it is to master. Now, this may all be nostalgia speaking, but I really do love this game. I may not play as much as I used to, but I do still play with friends and family when I get a chance. The online community is great from what I've seen, and Steam provides us with a revival of easy-access online lobbies that we haven't seen for quite awhile. And the fact that it's actually regularly updated and even new content is created for this classic title only makes this game more enticing. The balance and the community are better than ever. If you're coming back to Age of Empires or looking for a new RTS to learn, this is a solid choice that I don't think you will regret."
A great step up from the base game. Recommended for hardcore AoE fans.
"Amazing strategy game. This is a classic. The new Steam features are an extremely welcome addition. This game plays better and smoother than the sequel, in my opinion. You won't be dissapointed as a new comer, or a long time fan of the series. Mod support is pretty good, too."
It's been my favorite RTS since it came out! 10/10
"I have played for more than 1800 hours so all i can tell you this game its good. Developers are lazzy fkrs that dont patch the game or the multiplayer, but the game is good"
Just buy it 10/10 would wololo again p.s new dlc is awesomazing
Graphics could be better but the game is good! Perfect to play against friends or single player.
"Amazing game :D I've loved it since I was a wee lad ;) ...But lately, the gameplay has gone down in quality after some Steam updates to the game. I've noticed that units on and off have issues with routing, and very often do they end up crowding around doorways, backing up the entire line during a battle... the timer function is gone now, so I can't tell how long I've been in a match... and the interface for Standard games (single) went from decent to drab... if possible, the game quality went backwards! ...What's going on, mate?  Other than that... the game has remarkable replayability, and is exciting to play both on and offline. For the beginner though, you may win every single player match... but you'll get destroyed online unless you come up with unconventional strategies. From experience, I managed to master the hardest difficulty with multiple computers against me... but my first online match ended in frustrating. From monk armies, to single unit flooding... a game can end in the first 5 minutes, or somewhere in the realm of 6 hours.   10/10 one of my favourite games... despite frustrating updates that, I feel, are tanking the quality of experience."
"The HD version is definitely worth grabbing, especially if you're like me and played the original as a kid. Learn to play against others and you'll have a whole lot of fun!"
i have no memory of this game
AWESOME NEED FRIENDS TO PLAY IT THOUGH
"after downloading, it worked beautifully for three days. now I can't launch the game. It tells me every time that there is already an instance of the game running. I've tried multiple tips and tricks to no avail. I am still unable to play. Starting to really ♥♥♥♥ me off. I haven't found any help on the matter."
WOLOLO  10/10 would convert again
"Had a problem with framerate while I was moving the mouse. It was fixed by updating my video cards drivers. Game runs fine now. Gotta change my negative review to a positive one. So, if you are prepared to once again waste literal DAYS of your life building an empire and micromanage your peons then get on it! New to the game? Prepare for old as frack graphics, and learn to micromanage an empire against second rate AI. Oldie but a goodie."
Still one of the greatest RTS games ever created.
"Hello Steam Crew, I have been playing AoE II for a while and one big problem is that there is no unpause button nore a pause limit. The enemy team was losing last night and they have paused the game. Now it has been like 20 h and we are still waiting. We dont quit either because I want my rank! I wont give up to such a dirty trick! Please help.  Best Regards "
"I used to really like this game, and it is a good game. I give it a thumbs down, though, because this version doesn't add any tangible value. In the new campaign they had really bad taste, and put dirty language in. Also, they have a 'Dracula' campaign - how dissapointing. When people run out of creativity they resort to useless and dirty things."
"Here go the pack of teutons knight's.... And our Templar code is Veni, Vidi, Vici!"
Has to be one of the best god damn games i have ever played :3 1. Easy to learn. 2. fun to play. 3. and you acculy get to lear stuff about the civilizations you can play as. :D
Really only fun for multiplayer...sadly I have no friends.
"One of my all time avourite. I have been a fan and been playing AOEII since I was a kid. It doesnt matter how many years pass by, AOE II is a classic and will always remain in my heart."
Love this game its always been fun trying to build the ultimate empire and wage war against others while still having a strong sense of strategy to your attacks. if you like strategy this is a game you should look into playing.
Great game which still hasn't lost its touch. Great to see there is still a community/support for the game!
"This Game is AWESOME. The first version was out nearly 17 years ago, and the strategic stays superb. 5* for this game"
i am pleased of how great the graphics are now. Looking for the complete edition
pretty good imo
The best.
Wololo
A reborn classic that belongs in every game library simply for the legacy it upholds. A shining piece of PC gaming history rejuvinated and still standing strong.
"good game, really easy to play multiplayer now that it's integrated with steam."
"The good old classic, although I do not think it really is HD. The resolution is poor and nothing changed even after my countless efforts...  I recommend if you liked the game, but do not expect miracles about graphics. "
""
"One of the best strategy games out there!!! Get it, you will not regret it :-)"
"Awesome game,  I used to play this game when I was way younger and it was a highlight of my gaming life for my younger years, this has made me remember so many great things about the game and made me get back into it again, the new African Kingdoms Expansion just adds to your favorite game!  I rate 10/10, not even a second thought."
"10/10 would relive my childhood again.  Seriously, though, if you haven't played this, you should. This game and it's predecessor re-defined RTS gameplay."
Great to have had a newfound reason to play this game. Just as fun as it ever was and with some minor improvements. Looks and plays great too.
"Finally bought them ! Age of Empires, Age of Mythology and Rise of Nations. These are the only three names you need to remember about RTS games."
"Playing this game gave me so many memories when i was young, this HD version just made me remember them"
10/10. Works great in Steam + PlayOnLinux. One minor bug is that some hotkeys stop working if you minimize + maximize the game window.
"if you play this game you will get the folowing 11,30,14"
this is gud
"i played aoe2 like 15 years ago and it was one of my favorite games like everyone else those days.Now im grown up and im better in the game and the game has bunch of new stuf(new civs,maps..) if you liked the game back then please dont hesitate just buy this game.İts great i promise :)"
"Amazing game, great for friends to play together."
I've been playing this game for years before steam came out with it again. Whenever i play solo againt AI they dont build walls. That makes it to easy to attack them and not as much fun anymore.
So much fun.. real time killer and addicting.
Great game . A true legend
A true classic RTS game
Iv played some hours on this game but when i open the game it crashes gg 
"Awesome game, Takes lots of strategy to play. Really fun to fool around with friends and to use cheats."
old and dull.
Age of Empires is the best real time strategy game I've ever played.  I hope they implement a rating system for custom games like Castleblood (just like voobly)
A great timeless game. but lags with lots of units. Does not mater how powerful your computer is it will lag. Playing multi player with people so much lag. Also you CANNOT play this game sandboxed.
Quite possibly the best game of all time!
Takes me back to the good ol days
"Wow, this is one of the most fun RTS games i've played in a while. Great community. Glad they remade it in HD, it's got a pretty stable playerbase now. You will not have trouble finding servers to play on. I would however recommend that you get some friends to play this with, because if you are garbage trash like me, you need other people to play with you that are also new so you can actually have some fun without getting completely destroyed. If you don't have friends because you are a nerd loser, singleplayer is fun too! There are multiple campaigns to dump many hours into, and with the scenario editor and custom games, there are nearly endless possibilities.   9/10 oldie but a goodie stevie boy recommends"
I used to be good at this game. Seems to have gotten better with an excellent community behind it.
Pretty good game guys. i think its 8/.5
Best geym ever ten awt of ten mast bay for RTS fans layk mi
"Best game of my child and adult hood! When I got grounded as a kid, I didnt get grounded from hanging out, I got grounded form AOE 2!"
"A classic RTS that has gotten even better with the new DLCs (though neither is necessary; the base game stands alone just fine). It's not as complex as later similar games, such as Empire Earth or Rise of Nations, but I think it has vastly more staying power than those titles. Now obviously you buy games like this for the random map battles, against either human players or AI. Still, don't overlook the campaigns; they're quite fun in their own right!"
The nostalgia is real!
9/6 would be absoulutly destroyed by randoms again.
Last update the multiplayer doesn't work anymore. It get stuck on the 'connecting to the game' screen
"It's Age of Empires 2, nothing but that... That thing it's just a way to make money, they improved very little the graph and said that it was something new, I would pay nothing more than 1U$ for this."
"A really old classic that I just adore.  P.S If anyone can help me with this.  The game seems really zoomed in than my ps2 version, is there anyway to zoom out a bit in order to see more?"
"I've no idea how this game got 68/100 as a rating, but from my End I got to say that I spend alot of time playing this with my Brother, it even got me and my brother closer somehow, we elaborate strategies and play against the bots and try to get better every single time we play. I've bought us both the new expansions that came out and we are rediscovering the whole game once more with new features. really impressed. I would recommand this game for the rest of my life, since it captures the whole essence of what an RTS should be, don't get fooled by the graphics, this game is worth every penny."
I played this as a child AND I was good at it! Then 'The Sims' came and all my strategic skills were gone with it.  Now I suck at it and can barely play through the campaign on easy mode. End of story.  It's still an awesome game though. Absolutely love it.
this game ruin friendships
Age of Empires? More like age of Paladins. 10/10
Come back to a real classic RTS. Anything mid-evil from Europe to Asia this game has. Although the game still stuffers from some cheap wins that should have been re-balanced. Now reaching its 2nd decade this game will stand as a classic in PC gaming. 7/10
years have passed and I still enjoy playing this game!!
"Multiplayer completely, fundementally, down to it's wires broken as all ♥♥♥♥. Ridiculous framelate lag, as in 1 frame a second. I tried playing it with one other person in the same room, but there is no LAN support whatsoever in this edition, so we had to use online, but it was still completely broken with 15~ ping. It's a complete shame as the new DLC and AI/UI updates are perfect and would make the game even better than before if you could actually play it.  If your thinking of buying this game, Wait until they have fixed what they have broken."
Why would you need a review? Its age of empires just buy it.
"Great Game!  If you're a newcomer, it's very hard to start in multyplayer. But everything else is just awsome. "
Good classic game
"Prefer this version of the game to the newer ones, I like being able to see the bigger screen and the large range of settings to create your own game detail/map. I like that you can play a whole game in a pretty short time if thats what you want or if you want to drag it out over days you can just by changing a few simple settings. I like that you can win the game in a variety of ways - not always by fighting other AI players, i.e. you can win by collecting all the relics or building a wonder. In other words you don't always have to take a violence route, which is my personal preference!"
"Well it's what you love and hate about age of empires II. It's you know, the game Age of Empires II. Which is nice, and like less nice in certain aspects, but mostly nice.  8/10 would buy again."
"Got it on sale, much worth 100/10."
I have played this game as a child all the time and now that it has been remastered and has 2 more DLC make it more the better. 10/10 Love this game
One of the best RTS games I've played! Never a dull moment with crazy micro managing that can make or break a victory!
"It's a classic, AMAZING GAME. Nostalgia. Always will be one of the best. "
December 2001. My family just bought a brand new desktop. Age of Empire II came preinstalled. Saw my dad playing it and wanted to play too. Been playing for 15 years now. Still best RTS game ever made.
As good as in 2000
"AoE 2 is a damn good RTS, and the HD edition just makes it better, if only slightly.  The story is unique, but far from original, which is alright considering it's based on real events. Not many games so this, but the charm only gets you so far. The missions are good, but not where the game truly shines.  That would be the multiplayer. It's fun, but not innovative. That's fine for what it is, and what it does do, though not new, is extremely solid.   The graphics are sharp and crisp along with the sound. It looks very good, especially because this is essentially a rerelease, with a little graphical tweaking. The sound is iconic and only enhances the game's charm factor. Who can forget the classic exclamation of 'Wololo?'   Overall, I'd give the game a well deserved 8/10. It's solid gameplay and enjoyable aesthetic make it a blast to play with friends. The story has merit, too, but most of your time will likely be spent on the multiplayer and custom scenarios."
This is a strategy game in which you use preist to convert enemy trebuches instead of putting any work into building them yourself. WO LO LO LO!
"AOE is a fun RTS game, My time playing this game has been since the very first AOE to the third installment of the game.  Personally if you want an old nostalgic game to play, i recomend this game. its fun offline along with the campigns I've yet to see the online multiplayer version thought Overall this game is good"
monk stole my ♥♥♥♥ing relic
"&lt;3 !!! As good as I remember it. The update to HD is great. The expansions are really unnecessary, but I realize they did them to reinvigorate the game with something new to sell."
this game wont play plain and simple its either the game or steam but it wont work. tried looking on forums to fix the issue paid 20 dollars for this stupid game. 20 dollars to look at a menu and get some history lessons that i can get from wikipedia. i am asking for a refund.
"I finally got around to buying this and I'm so glad I did! AOE II was one of my favorite games, and with the new HD graphics and expansions, it's even more fun. I especially like the larger maps, more interesting maps and scenarios, and the ability to create large civilizations."
"Great game to play with friends, gets stale and boring real fast tho, I quit already!"
"Rubbish, with a horrid online 'community' if you can call it that."
"Played AoE I and II since I was a kid and it's good to see that it's still on - the III didn't worked so great and they made a wise choice to keep on working on Age II instead (need a HD version for the I tho). Undoubtedly the Age serie (empires and mythology) is by far the best real-time strategy games.  It can be extremely chaleging, even more if you try to be good with all kinds of warfare (infantary, cavalry, archer, siege, naval, defence and so on instead of focusing in only one), or it can be a walk in the park - even after finishing all campaing on hard I still like to play them on easy.  Being casual or hardcore game, old school or graphic lover, action or strategic player - no matter that because Age of Empires can have the perfect map and civilization for you. Has a bonus there is some nice interpretations of how things happened in history (some way off tho)."
-Only play multiplayer vs AI with friends -Always rename my steam account 'Goblin Expansionists' for AoE II time -Realize Spanish has a unique tech to make villagers 'good in combat' -Only build villagers all game -Strip the land of all of its resources -Build 12 town centers -200 villagers -Attack enemies with maxed villager tech -Villager AI doesnt automate combat -Villagers run around and get slaughtered unless I specifically tell them to attack -Enemy starts to destroy my empire -Give 10k+ of each resource to my friend and afk -come back to victory screen later GG ez game 10/10
"This game, my God this game...it's been in my life for 16 years and it's still rocking! There's even a team working on new content for this HD Edition now! What can I say, buy, love, play this. Because It's one of the best games ever made."
WAAAT IT IS CRAZY AND PIXELIZED
"¡The all star classic game has returned in almost HD glory! Even though some game mechanics are archaic and the original campaigns are grindy, is a blast to play in multiplayer. Liked the expansions and the new civilizations."
"I think it is quite needless to say, that this game has been amazing ever since its first release. It is a joy to see this game in steam. Hours of fun are guaranteed, patience to win online games needed (if you are an average player as I am) but in the end it's nothing more than an old classic that has remained an old classic!"
"Very fun game, if you have the money I would say just get it."
"Great game, old taste refreshed in glorious 1080p"
THE BEST GAMES EVER.
Really fun game! Used to play this a lot back in the day when I was younger and couldn't get enough. Fast forward today and the game still has the same charm it had a back than. Recommend playing with friends to get the most fun out of it!
This game is great. It's simple to play but has some complexity to it.
"Amazing game. First game I've ever played, and still continues to be one of my favorites. The limitless possibilities of creating a whole. i've foudn that this game can last very long. I average about an hour a game. However with the lightning gamemode, games canlast twenty minutes. Just an all aroudn great game to play with friends or even by yourself. I recmoned gettign the cmnplete edition, or waiting for it to go on sale. When this game does go on sale, it is a great buy"
This was the first game I ever played and now its in HD and a new DLC/Story...   10/10 One of the best games ever made.
This is one of my all time favorite games. So glad to have an update to work on modern OS's.
"Love to Play, i think its an nice remake of this Awesome Game. If you loved AoE2, you won't miss anything !"
very nice game no bugs no glitches very smooth but has a problem some mods such as reskin can not be added but over all this game is very nice.
"Anway a new game is released, Age 2 is still my number one since I go my first PC. Damn funny at LAN-Party!"
I highly recomend this game if you have a group of friends to play against :)
Two Words:  LAN PARTY
Graphics could be better but the game is good! Perfect to play against friends or single player.
"(G)Old game, A lot of my friends play this and at first glance i did not think highly of it, for how hold it is and the software of its time i would say this is a prety fantastic game"
I can't beat the game on moderate
"It works fine, i*am glad that there is a HD version. Great game!!"
"An excellent and incredibly well made title that helped to redefine the RTS genre. The sheer amount of game play and features that await you can be overwhelming, as holds true for the learning curve. Once mastered this game really shows how RTS can be done right, in any setting. Highly recommended for any true RTS and strategy fan."
Aah! Good ol' days but with better AI and multiplayer support. Would love to see an offline lan support for weekend 4v4 lan parties.
"Excellent redux of a classic from my childhood. The base game definitely needs some key mods to improve it, but just the fact that it has an associated workshop makes this effortless."
Wasn't sure if this was going to be worth it since I already own the old game but I brought it anyways and as soon as I got in to the game I saw some small changes which adds so much yet still keeps it feeling like the old aoe2 such as the steam integration is amazing. :D I would recommend this to any aoe fan.
"This was like, my favorite childhood game to play, and this rerelease is amazing."
I've played this game since i was like ♥♥♥♥ing 9 years old and i remember we didnt have internet so this was the only game i ever played and it is the best ♥♥♥♥ ever. New DLC are making it even ♥♥♥♥ing better. Buy it
"Re-experience your childhood in glorious 1920x1080 - this game never gets old, it's like a wine - getting better every year."
Best RTS ever have played it since i was 4
"Anyone who plays this game can already tell you how fantastic this time killer is. When I say 'time killer', I PROMISE that you will sit down and play this game over and over and over again. So go ahead and do yourself a favor; call into work for the next week, purchase all explansions and the base game, and kick out your girl for the week. A good way to save money too. (you'll play so much that you won't have time to spend money)"
"I ♥♥♥♥ing love warcraft 3 its great, but i cant see that dope 3d character portait instead its some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2d sprite. Wtf blizzard fix this game."
"A very fun, very worthwhile game. Of course I don't like paying full price, but as a classic with some added content, it seems well worth it to me. This game is a little old and doesn't have the nicest graphics, but the hd update is very nice and the game is playable on virtually every system."
"Age of Empires II HD (AoE2) is a real-time strategy game set in periods ranging between 500-1500AD, roughly. Originally released in 1999, this is the re-released HD edition, featuring enhanced graphics and AI (though is otherwise identical to the original release).  The base game + conquerors expansion (i.e. excluding new expansions) offers the player campaigns from several civilisations which follow the path of documented history (more or less), with each scenario often being dramatically different from the next. For example, a scenario may require the player to quickly form a base and defend it against attack, and then take the fight to the enemy(ies), or, perhaps you are given a large military force to begin with and must make your way through the map, capturing more units as you go, to get to a final destination. This variation keeps the player on their toes and interested in playing the next scenario. Before you know it, you'll have completed all of the base game campaigns and will have moved onto the expansions!  The tutorial campaign is an excellent introduction into the basic aspects of the game, but is lacking in advanced features (surprise surprise). It serves to introduce complete RTS noobs into the genre and does so quite well, with a reward 7 part tutorial campaign.  If you've not played this game (shame on you and your childhood), and you haven't played RTS games before, buy it! There are hundreds of hours in the campaigns alone and they are great fun and genuinely educational. If you have played RTS games before and liked them, I suspect you've already bought this, as any respectable human would.  The new expansions (released only for this HD edition) are both good, introducing several new and interesting civilisations, like the Indians, Italians, and Slavs. The campaigns for both expansions are of a comparable quality to the conquerors campaigns, but fall short of the main game campaigns. Well worth it if you like the game and want more of the same.  Random map games are the bread and butter of AoE2. These are where the player chooses a civilisation and alters the game information. You can customise most features of a game, including the victory conditions, map type, player count, team affiliations, starting resources, game speed, population cap etc. The player can choose between the original AI (loaded with the game on original release) or the improved AI, which is much harder; the player can also select between several difficulties as well, for quite a fine resolution of choices.   Multiplayer battles follow the same format as random map battles. There is a strong multiplayer community going and there are always tons of games to pick from; games can include random people, friends and AI members as well.   In addition to the suite of gameplay features, maps, campaigns, civilisations and multiplayer which could keep you occupied for thousands of hours, there are also really excellent overviews of each civilisation. Each overview is a historical synopsis of the civilisation and is always interesting to read, containing dates, people, places and famous wins and losses.   There is also a strong modding community with some nice graphical mods, gameplay mods and even some extra content.  I must have played hundreds upon hundreds of hours of this game when I had the original release, and the new additions don't so much as 'add' to the game, but more updates it to modern conventions of gaming. This is a very good rerelease for that reason. There's was no reason to dramatically alter the formula when it was working so wonderfully, and this is the result.   There are few games which you get quite as good value for money in terms of hours/currency; an excellent old game which has stood the test of time valiantly.   Metacritic for AoE2HD = 68%; Metacritic for original release = 92%; My score = 90%."
This is my top favorite game of all time. I can't say about it what hasn't already been said. It is simply fantastic.
"A classic RTS.  The HD remaster allows up to 500 unit cap.  New, better AI.  More civilizations to choose from.  Runs smooth and flawlessly on my machine. No more fiddling with compatibility modes."
"Come on. It's mother-frickin Age of Empires II! Any guy who grew up with strategy games must've at least played this. A timeless classic which has elements that surprisingly hold up to this day. Sure the isometric view has it's quirks like weird wall and gate placements, but this game is pretty damn fun. Picked it up on sale for cheap so I can't argue value wise. One thing to note is the finicky nature of the game itself. Sometimes it refuses to start while at other times getting online is a chore. But once you get in man oh man. Nostalgia.  And yes. I've played enough of it over the years (and finally on Steam) to have heard all 12 or so of the soundtrack enough to know their tunes. And props to that kickass theme.  And developers you cheeky bunch. Releasing a DLC after ALL THESE YEARS. Major props. Might pick it up soon. Ah well. Hope my farms don't run out again."
"I loved it growing up and the steam reboot is nice, good to play with a few friends!"
It's the classic game back and looking better than ever. Still the same great game I remember. My only wish is that the developers would have tried to optimize the game more to take advantage of modern gaming rigs.
I converted a tower to catholicism.  wo/lolo
"I owned Forgotten Empire a while back and played the ♥♥♥♥ out it, after hearing that a new expansion came out and the game was $7(Plus Forgotten Empire and the African Kingdoms expansion), I had to get it. I do not regret my purchace, the is game is a solid 10/10  Oh yeah they also included the voice lines from AoE 2  14 14 14"
"This game has aged incredibly well. The DLC adds a lot to the experience, but you don't miss out for not having it."
Bought this game when it originally came out years ago. Spent tons of hours on that with no regrets. I'll be doing the same on this HD version.  Definitely recommend this!
I LOVE THIS SO FREAKING MUCH
Monopoly is not the only game where friendships die. 10/10 Would get betrayed again by my best friend in an online match.
Multiplayer can suck if you have a bad connection but the game is awesome.
"Although this game is almost THE carbon-copy of the original which I had been looking for, in the original there was the option to tweak the resolution so that zooming out was possible. This isn't the case here, instead, based on whatever screen resolution you have, that's it. I'm stuck with a view that is way too zoomed in to be enjoyable. Surely they can fix this."
"I expect more 'refresh' Units dont looks as good as buildings, but game is still time consuming as oryginal. Good to buy in promotion but 20 euro is too much for this game. Anyway, good relaxing strategy."
"this game defined my childhood. it was the first RTS i had ever had, and i got it when i was ten or something. i am now twenty, and to this day i still play it (albeit badly lol) and i think it is a must have for any pc gamer simply because of the nostalgia. while this game might not have the flashiest graphics on the market, the playing experience is second to none simply becaues of the intricate balance between the civilisations, and the variety of units, buildings, and technologies that all have an impact on the game to some extent. when i was younger my favorite strategy was to fully upgrade the seige rams and then load them with swordsmen, also fully upgraded, and send a ton of them at the enemy base. the infantry inside the rams provided a speed and attack bonus, and when a ram was destroyed, six units would pop out and get revenge for me. i don't know how well that would work against a real person, as on the retail version that i got the multiplayer capablitily was dissabled. in short, this is gaminging history right here, and even though it is a little old, it is still worth the buy. one would have to be snorting some funky stuff to pass Age of Empires II up. i know it has been a long review, and if you read this far, thank you. i'll see you all in a game lobby some time eh?"
There are 2 strategy games of all times. One is Age of Empires 2 HD the other is Starcraft 1-2.
in my view the best game in the Age of line up
"The classics rule! I've been playing this game since 2002, when I was 7 , the good thing for AOE2 is that you never get tired of it. the graphics are very comfortable to handle the game, very addictive itself. Highly recommend for those who prefer RTS with amazing action."
Once Again it has been for the most part fixed after the devs broke it
It's so good I bought it twice. yeheheheheheheheha
fun and exciting brings back memories
"This is the best RTS game ever! My brother and I have played this game on our Pentium 1, 2's and 3's! It's so cool to be able to play this game again with him on windows 10. I love the HD version with all the new civilizations. I couldn't recommend this game more!!"
"Online play is kind of bland, everyone just masses archers because the unit control ai is horrible. Game still brings back good memories though."
It's a classic. The active community really adds a good amount of content to keep you playing.
Make elephants fight to the death and kill everything with a Shelby cobra
"This game is great at holding up to the test of time. Functionality is still great and the game has a decent following on the servers. For those of you looking for a traditional, RTS without cards or pay -to-win, this should be a great game for you to play."
Picked back up after 6 years of inactivity.  Still had as much fun as long ago. Great for all skill levels
"When I first heard about this game in second grade, I misheard it at the lunch table at first. I heard it as 'Age of Vampires II' because they would say it so fast. Now, you have to admit, at that age, anyone would think that sounds cool for a game. So I went out and looked for it, finding only 'Age of Empires II.' So I thought, 'Ok, well I guess this will be okay.'  Little did I know I was purchasing one of the BEST GAMES EVER. I've probably played this game more hours than I can even count. If you see this game for sale, you'd be a complete and utter FAILURE to pass it up."
"I grew up on this game, and I loved every minute of it. I enjoy the fact you can have a long-term game, but you do not have to finish it in one sitting. You will spend days trying out new ways to manage your empire, and how you will defend your castle. It is a never ending game of pure joy.  8.5/10"
LOVE IT! Lots of fun for older buddies hanging out or playing with younger kids to spend time with. Great all around!
Classic game that never goes out of style for me. This version has some differences and limitations on keyboard shortcut configurations... maybe I'll crack that code eventually
"I wouldn't recommend buying this right now as there seems to be a major problem with it. With many buyers, including me, it seems that it will not load into a game and instead will tell you that 'Steam servers are busy (error code 41)' and quit out of the game instead of loading a map. If you are interested in AOE, I would suggest you wait and see if this problem ever gets resovled. For now, there seems to be no fix to error code 41.  That being said, I just want to be able to play my old favorite game one more time and hope that it gets fixed soon. From memory, I still say this game is awesome."
buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game
 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Age of Empires II: HD Edition review   1) Essential - buy it NOW  2) Recommended - buy it on sale
"playing this game like since i remember, HD Edition was not required, but best RTS ever"
This is my favourtie game for years now.
A great HD Remake of a great game.
Old but gold
"I knew I was bad at strategy games when the enemy AI built a farm just next to my castle and that it took me literally 7 freakin' minutes to destroy it before I was wiped out of the surface of Earth. Needless to say, I'm addicted."
Mother of RTS games.  + Very detailed and excellent gameplay.  - Price tag is not so fair.
Better graphics and an AI that deserves to be called opponent!
Wololo
"I'm glad that Microsoft let this happen. As a kid in the late 90's and early 00's, this was my go to game. Now its back, and bigger and better than ever. AoE II is a must for any RTS player."
I dont like strategy games but ik kan play this eny day And enjoy it 5.9/10
"Really good game, I played a lot when I was a child, and after a long time I played it again and still good."
*Nostalgia Intensifies* I just love this game!!!  Everything from the gameplay to the graphics that are nice (for it's time).  Would give it a 9 Outta 10
"If you have an AMD VGA and are having issues, new drivers fixed it.  Other than that... If you dont know this game. You should. If you do know this game. You should be playing it.  Nostalgia magic aside, this game holds up reaaaaly well. Lovable disctinct factions (kingdoms), great mix of units, counters, possible cheese plays. Ruthless and funny multiplayer experience.   Havent noticed any flaws (other than the fixed ati/amd thing) except for mouse clicks not registering sometimes on the UI ingame. Barely noticable.  Up there (still) with forged alliance, wc3 and the like in my books."
"Awesome game. This is a nuetral review but steam doesnt alow it so ill put it in the positive section.  This game is awesome, huge battles, town mangement and its semi realistic... But the thing is you can just buy the origional copy for cheaper than 20 dollars. And the African kingdoms is just a retexured version of the game and is alot of money. The game is glitchy and theres alot of lag.  I would recomend this game for entertainment but I cant see myself playing anymore"
This is a very nostaglic game that still has great aspects of play. This is a game that I lose track of time because I'm so into it!
"party like it's 1999  Age of Empires II is still one of the finest examples of an RTS available today, and the HD Edition puts a nice polish on the old stalwart while retaining all of the late 90s charm and simplicity. AoEII offers a huge amount of singleplayer content and an absurd amount of multiplayer potential (amplified by the inclusion of Steam Workshop support!)  What makes it even better is that there's already been two additional content releases, the second (African Kingdoms) totally brand new - for a game originally released over ten years ago! This is exciting and adds even more potential to an already brilliant game."
-Generate a map without enemies. -Spawn a ♥♥♥♥ ton of villagers. -Have just one villager build EVERYTHING.  &gt; Was called a racist for what I named him.
That awkward moment when in childhood you didn't get that you are supposed to research tech and ages since you didn't understand english very well. 10/10 would go full militia again.
"I suck at thiis game, but I like being bad at this game"
Childhood redefined in HD.
Where are all my ♥♥♥♥♥s at? they aint no brothas in this poopy dikk game i r8 $/♥♥♥
"Age of Empires II has always been a strategy game that I would compare to any I would look at. With the 'updated' version I feel somewhat disappointed. It is good to jump back into the old memories, but their is nothing really new. If you don't have a large group of friend who also own this game getting it will be some what boring. The reason being that if you owned Aoe II like me when it originally came out, you have done all of the campaign already. The multiplayer is good alternative, however, if you like chatting and cordinating then you may have a problem. About half of the people who play will not talk to you.   I reccomend this game if you have a group of friends who are willing to play it with you. If not I find you will become bored of quickley and reccomend you not buy it."
"This game never gets old!  Just waiting for a time when any unit could be reskin according to the culture of their civilisation, similarly as buildings do (yes this Persian 'paladin' had always disturbed me...)"
"Age of Empire II HD is still as good as it was years ago. The campaign is great and is a good warm-up for multiplayer. Altough, the multiplayer is just unplayable because there are not powerful servers (which developers had promised) to run a complete game. Either the game crashes or you get 'Out of synch' at the beginning of the game. However, I still have a lot of fun playing AoE, but wait until it's 5$ to buy it."
"It's Age Of Empires 2 remasterd, i don't have to say much more."
"Best game ever. No reservations. Been playing it on and off for over 15 years and it still delivers. If you like strategy, get it."
"I bought this game on steam because my original copy stopped working on my x64 PC (every time I started it crashed).... And I'm amazed now on how well it works, and it is so gooooood to have multiplayer support, better and improved graphics (works fine on lower end cards), and comunity content from the workshop that makes the original experience even better! Also, this version features 'The Conquerors' expansion and another 3 expansions, so you will play this until you die! :) I recommend it to game owners just like me! Really good! BTW: I just think it is a little bit strange that the download is 2.3GB instead of something similar to a CD 700MB... These improvements are heavy :)"
"Classic RTS, almost therapeutic to play. Cheesesteak Jimmy's for life, son."
Always a game I thought about when I was younger but did not have a computer to run it. It does not disappoint! It gives the old time strategy game feel while still being challenging.
"What a great game! If you like RTS games based in the Ages, then you'll grow in age pretty quickly playing this. &gt;Fun &gt;You can build a lot of different ♥♥♥♥. &gt;You can kill-off your own team makes. &gt;Great chat-lines with voices. &gt;Still as good as it was about 17 years ago. &gt;And I'm cutting this review short, just so I can go back and play more!"
"One of my Favorite Old-School Games I used to play as a Kid.  Graphics are enhanced a lot but still you shouldnt consider this game to have 'real HD' which in my opinion doesn´t matter though.  What´s kinda dissappointing is that, despite high end Hardware, the game is kinda laggy when it comes to scrolling.   Nevertheless an absolutely awesome &amp; great Game which is totally deserves to be played once again :D"
Excellent game from yesteryear brought to life in HD. Loved this game before. Love it even more now. Definite recommend to anyone that enjoys RTS.
this game ruin friendships
its good
"Man. It's been YEARS since I've played AOEII. We have it on disk with the Conquerors expansion but I couldn't find it. So, I picked this one up (mostly due to the new expansions) and got back right where I started; sucking ♥♥♥ at AOEII. Still love the hell out of this game. Amazing soundtrack, great gameplay, and a good playerbase."
This game is awesome! The complexity of strategy within the game is amazing and the multiplayer area of the game is also very good because of a friendly community and excellent gameplay. Even without the multiplayer function the single player campaigns are riveting.
A great timeless game. but lags with lots of units. Does not mater how powerful your computer is it will lag. Playing multi player with people so much lag. Also you CANNOT play this game sandboxed.
Quite possibly the best game of all time!
I love playing this game. And its crazy they made a expansion not long ago. You wouldnt see that for a console game. Thats why pc gaming is awesome. There is really nothing wrong with the game. Plays well on old and new pcs.
"Ahh yes I just loved this game back in the day, and it was brought back great, even with some new features, better mulitplayer, and even new dlc, but there are still some downsides to this game.     Pros:"
"I guess 'Single Player - Standard Game' means go ♥♥♥♥ my self, which leads to desktop."
"Game refuses to launch. Fully up to date, and i've reinstalled countless times."
"This game won't even work, I have tried everything people online have said to do and keep getting a main.ccp error. I have found literally hundreds of posts from people with this error. Game will not run, fails to start as soon I click play from the launcher. What a rip off. Going to have to be more careful purchasing games from steam."
"game doesnt even work anymore! i wasted 20 dollars on a game that should have been 5. i want my money back, how the hell can you sell me a game that cant even work when i want it to? this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."
"0/10  cant play game, have deleted and reinstalled several times.  will not open the game?????"
Great game! I recommend this 100% if you like a good RTS game! improved graphics from the original game! played multiplayer without problems!
great game such war. no more memes ;) i like this game very much i play this in my childhood so yeah the main story is difficult and i like it :)  so i recommend this
"Same great game, terrible for newer large resolution monitors."
wolololol  yes  no  attack an enemy now  14  10/10
"In my opinion the best RTS game. Yeah better than Starcraft. I love Starcraft but man I played AOE II A LOT as a kid. There is a huge amount of strategy involved, lots of civilizations to play as, each with a unique unit and bonuses, and a bunch of hilarious memes. The game was and is still popular. Go play it!  Wolololo"
Fun game. Takes me back many years when i invested far too much time in the original game. Thumbs up from Hibby
"Hi Steam,  Can you please make this game available for Mac?! I play it on my PC but would totally love to be able to play on my Mac too. Thanks!  "
"This game was very fun until all of a sudden it wouldn't open at all, I would refund it if I could. Fun but there are some game breaking glitches as in de-syncing and not being able to open it. I have deleted it around 8 times and re-installed it but still it wont open. I have even tryed fixing it with steam help but no progress. If anybody knows how to fix this please tell me."
"IT was working fine, and now the latest update has ♥♥♥♥ed it up! Constantly crashes out part way through games. Pointless and made me stop playing due to this."
Nothing to say here. Great game. Wonderful gameplay. Lovely graphics. Strange AI. Weird tactics. Probably the best thing Microsoft ever distributed to mankind.   If you are too young to know this game - I pity you fools.
  It's slow and gay. 10/10
"Age of Empires II is a classic and is still a lot of fun to play after all these years.  I would pay good money to anyone that would do a PROPER remake of this game for today's computer tech. Don't make it a MMO (Age of Empires Online) and forget the stupid cartoony style.  I also didn't care too much for AoE3, so why mess with a winning concept?  PS:."
Just finished playing a 4v4 with my friends  I guess we could say it was fun.
*Nostalgia Intensifies* I just love this game!!!  Everything from the gameplay to the graphics that are nice (for it's time).  Would give it a 9 Outta 10
one of the best rts games ever made
Got days to spare? Because you'll need plenty if you're going to start on this game. Say goodbye to your evening.
"Age of Empires ll HD is one of my personal favorites. I just seems to bring back memories from when I was a kid and I played the orginal. Since the HD versions release joining and creating matches have been much easier. With Steam's In-game friend invites playing matches with your friends is as easy as two clicks. I would have to rate this 9/10. I rate it so highly since I really like the small fixes they made to make it better, but they where able to keep the old vibe still alive."
"the game is awesome, the fogotten campaign looks like some rookie created it and valve decided to sell it, affrican kingdoms definetly worth buying ;)"
"What a great game, i have spent many hours playing the age of empires series, even throughtout my younger years to today i still love picking up where i left off, i would have to say that the first age of empires will always be my most favorite of the series, the developers need to go back to that style of simplicity in my opinion, either way, if you havent played AoE i highly recommend giving this one a shot before trying any other AoE games, if you have a copy of the original AoE even better.

"Childhood relived in HD, never stopped loving this game!"
No patch fixing the lagging-issues in sp. 3 years after realse. wanted to have massive battles againt the ai with my friend but spikes destroys the expirence
Huns you the real mvp  10/10  would petard rush again
one of the best games of all time for sure
"The fact that aoe2 is one of the best strategy games out there, since its release before 16+ years ago its preety sad. RTS genre has died, aoe2 is keeping alive the spirit!"
"A very good game, still love it in 2016"
"The new update is bad. I can't just save a game in single player under whatever I want? It says it needs a code in it?  None of the cheat codes are working either.   I also can't seem to find the button to turn off the mouse being able to move the viewing window around. It's really irritating.   It's still a good game, but those flaws weren't there before."
"This is my first review, but this game holds a special place in my heart. My hour count does not take into account the hundreds or even thousands of hours I spent with the original edition during my childhood. As such I'm sure I may come across with bias, so take my review with a grain of salt.  Age of Empires 2 is a real tim... you know what it is. Its freaking Age of Empires 2. If you haven't heard of the franchise you've been living under a rock. Or too young to have played in its hayday.  Anyway, AOE 2 is a real time strategy game released in 1998, but don't quote me on the date. You control a small group of peasants and a horseman, from realworld factions circa 500AD onward, such as Britain, France, the Teutonic Empire, Persia, the Mongolian horde and many more. Your main goal is use that starting group to create a massive civilization to crush the other guy. It can be any combination of team upto and including 8 players, so games can become quite frantic. The remastered version has much improved graphics over the original, not that that is a challenge for such an old game. Mods exist that improve textures and such, but it is more than adequate  Single player:  You have the option to either play solo matches with or against the AI, which with the HD remastered edition has improved the AI quite a bit since the original release, in a variety of matches such as King of the Hill, deathmatch, the high resource endgame mode, Capture the relic, essentially capture the flag, the standard random map conquest and more.  Or play through the mostly, but occasionally very not historically accurate, single player campaigns. In which you play as a prominent historical faction or person as you complete their life's work, such as Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, Attila the Hun, El Cid, etc. Or single matches taking inspiration from real world battles such as Agincourt, or the Viking attempt to secure a foothold in America. The at cost DLC, The forgotten empires and African kingdoms add more variety to the single player campaign as well with their new factions and stories. I personally really enjoyed the campaigns from the base game, but the new ones fell a little flat for me.  Multiplayer  Very similar to my first paragraph regarding single player. Up to 8 people, or AI bots if you want to coop the ai, do battle just as before. However this is where my negatives come in. The game can be super laggy, especially in large team games. Not always, but enough that I try to avoid them. (I have pretty good internet).  As an old game, it does have more than its share of bugs, and the pathing of your people occasionally is a little wonky. Nothing too bad if you can manage your base well, and you may not notice it much at first.  However there are people of all skill levels around and quite active, you can almost always find a game for YOUR skill level, or multiple to choose from. Not bad for a 12 year old game! And generally speaking I've not run into any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, though a couple trolls here and there. But I try to avoid rooms that are marked as way out of my skill zone so maybe I don't see the whole picture.  Bonus Round: Map Editor  This basically amounts to a modding kit for levels and maps. Everything you could want to make your own custom level, make it as ridiculous as you please, or keep it simple. Triggers for advanced events take practice and maybe an online guide but allows you to make yourown campaign level for friends or anyone else, as all map editor work can be put up on the Steam Workshop for others to try out. All in all a very cool feature present from the original release.  TL;DR  SIngle player  -campaign is fun, challenging, and you might learn something, though they took some creative freedom in some parts -playing the bots with the new ai can be a good match, though the original ai is basically only good for beginners -bugs here and there  Multiplayer -buggy on occasion -balanced user base -surprisingly active community -can be laggy, even with good internet  Map editor -modding tool for custom levels, maps -intuitive for the most part, triggers are challenging at first however  Final Score  4.5/5  If you're into RTS style games, this is a classic, and for good reasons. If this strikes your fancy, its more than worth picking up the base game full price, though I recommend waiting for a sale for the DLC addons.  If you're interested in youtubers to checkout, there aren't any big subscriber base names, though I recommend either/or Resonance22 or ZeroEmpires. Both give good commentary and especially Resonance is very good at teaching the hows and whys of competitive strategy to new players."
"nice, feels like back in the old days + multiplayer lobby"
"Old RTS Still Recieveing Regular Updates.  For many one of the defining RTS games, it still looks it's age despite the HD remake, but has a lot of depth and replability with massive numbers of unique civilizations to choose from, and the game is still recieveing updates a decade later."
"Works like a charm. Much better than setting up a LAN like in the old days. Also, the 500 population cap is insane (in a good way), I'm still subconsiously stopping production around 200... it's kinda funny until you see that army of 300 barging through your walls like butter.  The new music is really weird, like LOTR almost, which just feels wrong. Encourages me to turn it off and run my own music."
Classic.  But uncontrollable resolution problem with laptops.
"Great update, well worth it especially if you can find it on sale. So much nostalgia."
"Its clearly F#ckn Sick C#nt, I mean if you look at it, they are still making S#it for it. Ergo, Therefore: F@ckn Sick"
This game will  never  get old. I appreciate that they implemented a relative stable multiplayer. +ELO-rating +Soundtrack  brings GOOD OLD TIMES back!! 
I much very liek it
"Amazing game. played this for years, this one is even better, more options and its in hd. I recommend"
Just as good now as it was back then!
"Hey, that's pretty good!"
This game is amazing and great for friends and family. One of the best games ever!
best recomanded game
The best game of my life.
Been in the same battle since buying
 Nostalgic strategi game in beautiful optimized HD. What's not to like?
Very Fun to play with friends
"A legendary classic and one of the finest RTS games ever made. The Mozart of Real Time Strategy comes again in full force, and although the HD launch was not as expected (with its bugs, lags and whatnot), the refreshment brought by the mod community was the spark needed to set ablaze the strategy phoenix for another generation."
An oldie but a goodie in my opinon. Still love playing this game years later!
"Excellent and very nostalgic game. They have refined the AI for even better gameplay, graphics improved as well.  A few multiplayer instabillities and issues need fixing, for instance it seems impossible to restore a saved multiplayer game."

"Hands down one of the best games ever. I've owned a CD of it for 15 years, and still love to play it. I can't wait to try out the Steam HD version, with the new expansion packs! Long live AoE2!"
The nostalgia is real!
"The best game ever, period. :=)"
"&gt;Playing Nomad with my brother and 2 AI &gt;It's taking us both ages to find a perfect place to settle &gt;Begin building settlement near some berry bushes and deer &gt;Gold veins and stone deposits are very close by, just out of visible distance &gt;My brother tells me he has settled too &gt;I send my scout on a mission to uncover his location &gt;5 seconds later I discover his town centre and see his villagers mining my gold and stone &gt;An arguement breaks out over territory &gt;We are both too ill equipped to settle our differences with militia &gt;We team up and build one massive settlement between our two civilizations &gt;The city becomes truly glorious &gt;A few military campaigns later and our AI enemies have been destroyed &gt;Team victory is off &gt;Our city divides itself into two factions &gt;Many buildings are burnt &gt;Many villagers are murderered &gt;We decide on stalemate and start over  Played this game so much when I was a kid, decided to get the Steam version and its still an incredible game. Instead of getting Age Of Empires IV we get a remake of this and I could not be more fine with that.  100+ villagers slaughtered/ 10 will continue to play again"
"since this game have bugs in many month and still not fixed, I suggest buy this game when listed on sale or midweek madness.  single player not affected at all (except on map overscrolling by mouse or d-pad), but probably affected at multiplayer mode (desync). just grab the essential ones with no DLC if you only want some recreations with the storyline.  7.5/10 would recommend this."
"I remember getting the game for my windows xp and playing the game for +700 hours in the game, now i still have the case of the origional game but now the cd so i was super happy they put AOE2 on steam, i bought it the day it came out on steam for me and my brother to play together like we used to do. 20/10 GREAT GAME!"
I would reccomend this game to anyone into this sort of stuff its by far the best age of empires out there i play pretty much ever day recently doesnt get old :) worth the money
"This game was already amazing but the HD totaly made it able to compeet with any modern day game. This hd effect will revolutionize the industry as we know it. As soon as i started playing it felt like ♥♥♥♥ came flying out of my screen. This however might have been hallucinations, since i sprayed toilet air freshener into my mouth thinking it was canned whipped cream."
Love the multiplayer interface as well as the additional DLC that is made available.
For my childhood memories
"This game is just as good as the original CD version. It is only missing LAN support. If you played this as a kid, do youself a favor and get this game and the expansions. It's lots of fun!"
This game is My best friend since i were a little kid.  This HD Version just make my dream come true.
Love this game and I highly recommend it to others.
"AoE2 is a game I grew up with. At the age of 11 I came across the demo of this game, with no prior knowledge of RTS games as I started up the wallace campaign. My first reaction was that i became attached to the style of gameplay, which of course is building up the civilization and managing recources. Playing through the campaign I felt like I had a well enough understanding of how the game works that I launched a random scenario. And I got my ♥♥♥ kicked...badly. For a late 90s game it stood out well and it stood proud as one of the great RTS games to date.  First off, lets talk about the graphics. It looks exactly the same as it did in 99'. Some may cry 'but wait! This is an HD remaster! It should look better!' I say ♥♥♥♥ off to that. The games graphics arent what needed an update. It was the optimization that was needed the most. If i installed the game from the Ye' old disc, the game would run of course, but resolution would be ♥♥♥♥ed and the water would be all purple and pixilated. But yeah I would understand the gripes with some saying it should be called HD edition, but in all honesty, the game works and is optimized well, so who cares?   The gameplay is next and it is still memorable and fun since the first day it was available. The goal is pretty much building up your civilization of your choice through the ages and fighting other players until an objective is completed, whether it being destroying opponents, collecting relics, killing the opposing king or other custom objectives. There are also campaign missions in the game. You get 5 campaigns in the Age of Kings, as well as 4 campaigns in the Conquerors expansion, and even more in the next two expansions (purchased seperately) that were not even previously available when the game was available in retail! Unfortunately, the campaigns bore me after a while and thus we go into the the scenario portion. This is were the bulk of the game can be fun and challenging. First, you can select one of 5 difficulties that suit your play style, as well as selecting a civilization for you and the ai as well as the teams. I personally prefer 1 v 7 where i am the lone wolf trying to defend my land. There is multiplayer, which i have yet to play, and last but not least, there is a map editior so you can custom create your own maps and challenges. Overall, there are alot of modes to choose from and keep yourself occupied for a long while.  The music section is short. Its pretty much one track that is 40+ mins long. Nothing explosive or amazing, and is pretty forgettable, but does its job in being background noise.  Last but not least the civilization roster is stellar. With 18 to pick from (more with the purchase of the two new expansions) and each function in different ways, so you'll have fun discovering what is unlockable with each civilization. I think that fun in discovery might just be me.  Unfortunately, it doesnt go without saying that its not perfect. This game is not for everyone, and may grow tiresome to those that dont understand, or to those that think it is too slow of a game... or those that think its outdated and aged poorly (...). But yeah I understand their opinion on it.  Overall, it is still the same experience that i grew up with and love. If you are unsure if its worth a buy, wait till it goes on sale and check it out.   8/10  "
Great game one of the first PC games I played back in the '90's' plays the same looks a lot better.
It was a good game but after 152 hours it no longer works.Thr age of empires web site won't respond to emails.to help.Steam doesn't seem very usefull either.Would I buy it again.I think I'll wait since to fix the problem it looks as if I'll have to delete it and reinstall.I'm not sure its worth it to pay to buy it again.
I love oldschool games such as age of empires! it's timeless and it works good
"If You'll try it once, You'll stuck for ages.  Of Empires.  11/10"
"I remember playing Age of Empires II for thousands of hours as a kid back when it was brand new.  Now, after purchasing the digital HD copy with its respective expansions from Steam, I will finally be able to absorb myself into this amazing game, again.  Now... When will there be an HD remastering of the first Age of Empires game with its Rise of Rome expansion? I'd like to replay that game, too."
Still the best game i know. Not too much tactics but just enough to make it hard too win easily.
One of the greatest strategy games ever and it still holds up well today.
The memories... I almost cried when i start this game... Its good old time AOE II but with better graphics. Its masterpiece of strategies and it always will be.
It's great if you want to play the orginal AOEII without hassle. The DLC is underwhelming and a bit of a waste of money. Aways use Original AI for random maps if you want the AI to create an acual army to fight as the new AI seems to not want to do that.
Played it for years... too bad there is no lan option.

"A while back I was browsing 9gag and I saw this funny pic (picture). I asked the OP (Original Poster) what the pic was from and he said Age of Empires 2!!! Now I've been playing this game for hours!1! 2 words, hella f*ckin epic"
awesome game loved it back in the day.stil do
"Such a good game even still today, great to play with friends but their is always that one nerd in the group that just ends up ♥♥♥♥ing everyone up."
"As one wise man once said, 'QUIT TOUCHING ME'.  Best. Game. Ever. Wololo/10"
"This game is a classic!  I grew up playing this game and it is still the horrible RTS I remember it to be. I say that in a positive manner. I love this game for the campaign mode and the simulation of the user vs. the computer.  The game is very easy to understand, even if you have never played an RTS before, and actually takes some strategy in some cases.  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a nostalgic trip back to the good old days of when games were simpler and FPS didn't matter.  8/10"
"What can I say, this is a classic."
"the story narration audio that was there in Age of empires II, Campaigns is missing.. and that is why the single player is not as per the standard.. It feels as if the crux of the story is missing"
30
Awesome game &lt;3
Why is this game not supported under Ubuntu? When will it come?
"It's Age of Empires 2 in HD , the original Game was already very good"
This is the game I would choose if I can only play one game in my whole life
"Loaded of bugs, worst than it ever has been in the past on the original."
"Seriously, who can go wrong with an Age of Empires game... NO ONE! that's who. From the first to the last version, this game never gets boring. Build it, challenge it...destroy it! Enough said."
"Very good game. I remember playing it when I was a kid and I have spent many very happy hours enjoying the strategic superb storyline; very easy and I completely recommend anyone to play it, truly one of the easiest games out there. One massive thumbs up!"
"Great game, worth purchasing!   Would also love to see AOE Rise of Rome be rereleased in HD at some point!"
"The game has aged well on its own, but the new HD work is great and worth the buy. Co-op and Multiplayer is fun and worth it alone."
"A classic of the RTS genre. Although not the first, AoE was among the best in the early days of strategy gaming. I haven't played nearly as much lately as I had prior to even the release of steam, but this game holds a large chunk of my gaming history due to its exceptional replayability and revolutionarily competent AI, for its time. If you're a fan of the RTS genre and would like to see one of the few games that set the baseline, pick up AoE whenever you get a chance. The HD rework is fairly visually appealing, but the gameplay is something that in itself is well worth the price of the game. High recommendations from a veteran of the Age of Empires series, if you haven't had the AoE experience, you're missing out!"
THE SHEEP EMPIRE SHALL RULE UPON THE PUNY HUMANS! BBBAAAHHHHH!
Barely functions
"No lan support, games get desynced, the beginning of the game is really laggy which messes with your build order.  Is no good."
"A classic is always a classic. It's a shame the resolution isn't changeble in the settings... (The old one, although with only 3 possible resolutions, they could be configured. Not in this one, especially bad for people with 2.5k or 4K monitors)"
"So the amount of hours I have on this game is nothing compared to how much I spent on the original version of this game and its expansion. I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game back then. I knew most of the good cheat codes for stuff like the cobra car or who could ever forget the unit that you could only move by itself, Furious the Monkey Boy. It's insta kill move. Its a game that is just really great overall. Plus the fact that they made additional dlc for such a good game. While I myself haven't got the new dlc for this game I will at some point. Its a good game to just waste your time on."
"This is a great game, all i would play in the mid 2000s"
"Loved this game as a kid, still love it these days.  The HD looks amazing, the game runs great, and the new content is pretty on point as well. "
This game.... Is so good cant stop thinking about it!
"fun game, other then some lagging, still works great. worth the buy."
"Possibly the most well crafted game of all time  100% would recommend to any player, goes on sale frequently for up to 85% off. Grabbing this game and it's expansions will be the best $8 you've ever spent.  W o l o l o b o i z"
LOVE this Game!!!!!!!!!
Wololo my friends. Wololo.
"Still the gold standard for real-time strategy games more than 15 years after its release, Age of Empires 2 didn't age  that  well. 'HD' in this case quite literally means that the game supports higher resolutions and has crisper details: don't expect a complete overhaul. Sure, the AI was improved, and there are a few new civilizations to choose from (if you buy the DLC), but ultimately, the game plays and feels like it's 1999.  That doesn't mean that it's bad: quite the opposite, in fact. I really like playing this game with friends. But once you take off the nostalgia goggles, you realize that the game's shortcomings means there are substantially better and more modern RTS games out there.  The pathfinding is atrocious, the base management and economic development are unnecessarily cumbersome, the civilizations are not diverse enough, the single-player campaign is uninspired, and the dated combat system favours sending large swarms of junk units and early rushes over careful planning and execution.  In many, many ways,  Age of Empires 3 , which was released in 2005, is more modern and fun than Age of Empires 2, and isn't in need of an 'HD' remake. Hardcore RTS fans might've snubbed AoE 3 back in the days because they felt like the gameplay was 'dumbed down' compared to that of AoE 2, but the fact is that sometimes, less is more. Especially when it's done right.  But since all your friends are nostalgic 90's kids, you might as well grab this one when it's on sale. Otherwise, I know this is an unpopular opinion, but you should really stick to Age of Empires 3."
much nostalgia of life before teh suck
"I grew up on Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, which uses the same game engine as AoEII. I have put countless hours into SW:GB, and I aim to do the same with this awesome game as well.  If you've played Battlegrounds prior to this, you'll have little difficulty jumping in. The only major difference is the lack of units that base their existence on aerial/anti-aerial combat, but this isn't a problem for me at all. It plays almost exactly the same; collect resources with villagers, build and fortify your base, research tech, and knock out your opponent's bases with maxed-out armies. For more excitement, play the campaigns.  10/10, do not regret this purchase one bit. Although I do wish I had waited to buy the DLC on sale, rather than full-price."
Priests shall convert all your elephants your walls mean nothing your rams mean nothing your towers mean nothing all that matters is the alpacas are with us and furious the monkey boy rules all the end of my stupidity
This is my top favorite game of all time. I can't say about it what hasn't already been said. It is simply fantastic.
"A strategy game classic, made better with an improved AI system and cool HD graphics. If you love good strategy games, this is as good as they can come. 10/10"
Classic RTS
A classic that still holds true to the RTS genre. If you've ever played the AoE series or other RTS i recommend this wholeheartedly. Plus you get to make sure the Aztecs beat those damn Spanish.
'Wololo' ~Priest 2001-2016  Sorry i got to wololo
"ive had this game from the start, and its always been either too buggy to play. or not playable at all, as it will crash from startup. wish i could get my money back from this, its been too long for me not to be able to play the game on the latest version. saddest part is, if i play on last version, i win all my games cuz my AI enemies are too bugged to attack walls, they just dont attack walls. there are huge masses of armies outside my walls and they just dont attack them. rediculous. dont buy this game."
I would rate 5/7
"This is the game you remember. It's been updated with HD textures, a new expansion, and mod support. Nostalgia awaits."
"I can't tell you how fantastic this game is, or how much of my childhood was spent on it! If you want a fantastic, fun medieval strategy game this is a great choice!"
Still a great game after all these years.
"Very good game. Expensive for how old it is, but very good"
Perfect.  10/10
It's just great.  . . . 15 years later: It's just great.
Never before has a hd remake improved virtual fire by this much! 5 stars!!!
Classic Age of Empires. Worth every dollar. If you have friends to play with it's endless fun.
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
"An excellent remake of one of the original best RTS games of all time. Age of Empires 2 always brought me joy back in the day, and now in it's remastered form it's even better.  Pro's -Excellent balance between micromanaging and focusing on all out warfare/economic development. -Remastered graphics look great. -Great introductory game to new RTS players and a good challenge for veterans depending on difficulty settings. -Well balanced units and a plethora of civilizations with custom units, bonuses, and techs to choose from. -Great multiplayer community. -Outstanding community made custom content.  Con's -Fixed camera angle as in the original game, no camera rotation. -AI can be slightly odd on certain maps especially those containing large amounts of water. -Price point for DLC is on the high side."
"This game brings back such memories, i was 10 years old when i play this"
A very amusing game to play with your friends on a rainy day ;)
"Good memories, Great game"
"Worse than expected when I bought it... but still good. Has everything that Age of Empires II had plus some new features like better graphics and new races, although you have to pay for every expansion in order to use them. After some patches multiplayer works as it should, Steam makes it very easy to join matches and play with friends as well, which I think is the main point of the game. There's many custom maps made by players on the Workshop, so many good maps. Matches can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours or more, sometimes a lot more.  Had 120+ hours of fun. My favorite RTS game so far."
its great need to make a new one modern day
"Love this game, wish they would fix the zoom, though."
"Managed to get finally into a ranked match , got to castle age and lost , never played ranked again. 10/10"
Very fun game. It's a classic among my family. All my brothers (except for that one traitor) have played it. One of the best RTS games in my opinion (along with Rome Total War II) 10/10 would buy again.
"I've been playing this game since I was a very young child, so when I saw this on steam I nearly cried with joy. This is by far one of the best strategy and medieval style games, and I would highly reccomend it. For those who played this back before steam, I would definitely reccomend it. For others, I suggest you try it for yourself if you like long strategy games based in a medieval setting."
"Just as I remembered it as a kid, with some minor enhancements, loving the new civilisations that have been added. Great for playing multiplayer and still just as fun to go at it alone and kick some AI's teeth in."
Wololo
"Does handle wide screen play, no resolution scaling a total nightmare do not wast your money . At no time in the discription on Steam was this issue mentioned I have been ' had ' don't trust there info on old games look at other reviews then think twice be for you buy. I played it for 3 hours and never started it again"
"I love the Age of Empire series, I am really glad that it is on steam, and that the series has been revived. I enjoy playing AoG with my friends, we tend to do lan parties and stay up late playing (life of a college kid)  If I may add a suggestion, would it be possible that you could make a DLC with some more of the great European empires in it?  One empire that I would like to see added to the series would be the Austrian/Hungarian Empire"
this a a good game for people who like the old command &amp; concore site up
"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game any longer... The developers have abandoned the community, and left us with a broken, buggy game. As fun as it is, I don't recommend buying this game, and I surely don't reccommend buying the African Kingdom's expansion, which I am so very disappointed with... The civilizations are fun to play with, but it's totally not worth having a half-arsed, pathetic gaming experience.  AoE 2 IS fun, but I would suggest buying the physical game and playing on Voobly instead of on HD servers, because you'll only meet lots of lag, desyncs and crashes. Worst of all, the developers don't care one bit, and haven't actually tried to do anything with it for a long time.  Until then, my review has been switched from recommendation to non-recommendation. But don't hold your breath, the developers are much more worried about fixing another terrible job they did on another Age of Empires game with a microscopic fanbase compared to this one. I will definitely say that I will be making no more purchases in relation to AoE 2 HD until the reviews are absolutely stellar, because I'm tired of being let down.  Shame on you, developers, I paid money for the AK expansion 3 times for 3 people, and this is what I get. A lame, terribly done mod. Don't release garbage to the public, and fix the freakin game."
"Great game, one of my favorite RTS games."
I was hoping that an updated version would allow me to play my favorite game growing up and my dream came true. Just like playing the old version except with an updated graphics engine that allows newer computers to play this wonderful game.
one of my all time favorite games and now i can play it again without worrying about a hard disc getting scrathed
"Thanks SO much for making an HD re-release! This game brings back SO many memories from the classic AoEII. It keeps all of the original aspects, and makes them better. My original disc doesn't work anymore, due to it being old, so this keeps me with AoE!"
"So great to be able to play a classic again. If you haven't already played this game, I recommend you give it a go."
"Skybox Labs has done jack to fix the game they broke 4 months ago. Game continuously lags out and they have broken restore save game, so if you're playing with friends and someone drops, its all over."
This game is the ♥♥♥♥.
One of the best classic. IMO one of the best RTS ever made.
"This IS 1 of the best games ever made in pc history that raised the bar of real time strategy so much that it is literally unreachable to any sequel or other franchise to even come close to the prefection that this game is.  The voices, graphics, theme/art style, gameplay depth, replayability it's off the charts. With custom campaign, scenarios, and maps all made by the great community that aoe2 has. Even After 16 years of the original release of this game, there's still oficial DLC Expantions releases coming out mostly because the dedication and love that the community had all this years for aoe2, that says something...  The only problem with this game its not being in your PC already !!!"
"AI is unplayable!  Right now there is a bug that causes the AI to 'stick' in place, villagers will get 'stuck', entire armies of military will be frozen in place.  There has been times where I have built up a city for 20-30mins only to walk to the enemy city and find a load of frozen units blocking their villagers. The single player/AI is literally unplayable and they have NOT fixed it despite months of it being this way.  Multiplayer still works though and that's all they care about."
"Ive played the original game, this brings back so many memories and i recommend this game its fun and i can finally build a castle without having nails or a hammer"
"Very solid update to this dated game. Visually, not appealing beyond nostalgia. But the game itself is a blast to play. Good times."
"it works gud now.  OLD REVIEW : laggy piece of crap, nothing is improved too. but works.  worth it if you want to play multiplayer. (with 1 second delay each action ofcourse)  10-20fps during huge battle. probs i need dual gtx 980 and overclocked i7 for this."
"Age of Empires 2 is a fun and informative RTS game first relesed 1999 but has since then had multiple new expansions. The campaigns is my favorite aspect of the game and I can always return and replay the campaigns. The game itself is good and you can spend several hours playing online or against the AI, but after a time it gets a bit repetitive.  Game gets a score of 7,75/10 from me. It deserves a + for having multiplayer  Story 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Replayability 6/10 Production Quality 9/10"
This is one of my all time favorite games. So glad to have an update to work on modern OS's.
"Love to Play, i think its an nice remake of this Awesome Game. If you loved AoE2, you won't miss anything !"
Wow! I Used To Play This As A Really Young Child And Probably The First Or One Of The First PC Games I Played!! Endless Hours Of Fun And Will Always Be A Favorite!
"My favorite game of all time. Not much too say that hasn't already been said of this game. I have been playing it since about the time of its original release. Never get bored playing. I recommend this game not just to fans of RTS games, but anyone.  I give it a 20/10"
11/10 would wolo again.
Alot of old school RTS bliss.
"Best of the oldies Online game sucks, though..."
"best game ever, a never ending jorney to joy and fun."
"i recommend this game to people that wanna have a good time and just relax!  it's a great game to play with your friends, battle it out and see who got the best stratagy!"
"It's Age of Empires 2 and it's even better than it used to be (e.g. the ease and stability of Steam multiplayer, Steam workshop, DLC with more empires). This is a fantastic, classic RTS that every fan of the genre should at least try."
"One of the the best AoEs out there, maybe THE BEST. I'm playing it since i was a child, and fun never ended."
I tried starting it and Malwarebytes' Anti-Randomware blocked it. 10/10.
Its like if Civilization and Warcraft II had a baby together. Whats not to love?
Played this game since i am 10... i still can't handle npc-enemys that are above medi
"This game was very fun until all of a sudden it wouldn't open at all, I would refund it if I could. Fun but there are some game breaking glitches as in de-syncing and not being able to open it. I have deleted it around 8 times and re-installed it but still it wont open. I have even tryed fixing it with steam help but no progress. If anybody knows how to fix this please tell me."
"IT was working fine, and now the latest update has ♥♥♥♥ed it up! Constantly crashes out part way through games. Pointless and made me stop playing due to this."
Nothing to say here. Great game. Wonderful gameplay. Lovely graphics. Strange AI. Weird tactics. Probably the best thing Microsoft ever distributed to mankind.   If you are too young to know this game - I pity you fools.
  It's slow and gay. 10/10
"Age of Empires II is a classic and is still a lot of fun to play after all these years.  I would pay good money to anyone that would do a PROPER remake of this game for today's computer tech. Don't make it a MMO (Age of Empires Online) and forget the stupid cartoony style.  I also didn't care too much for AoE3, so why mess with a winning concept?  PS:."
"Limited options for settings, I would really like to be able to crank up the AA and or Supersample this game.  Tho if you haven't played this game, it's an absolute classic that still holds up very well. 10/10"
"The units are much smaller in this iteration of AOE II than they are in the original, due to the 'HD' aspect of the game. For me and a number of other purchasers who have noted this unfortunate aspect of the game in online forums, this makes AOE II HD very difficult to play. It's an inferior version of the original, and certainly not worth the purchase price of $20."
usually i can't sit and play something for more than 10 minutes.   i played for 2 hours straight.  maybe ill play videogames again.
"One of the best RTS games ever, now improved."
"An excellent game back in the day and an excellent game still, and with the HD remaster it's a definit must have in my opinion, especially if you have a friend or two to play with.  Cheerio!"
Half life 3 confirmed!!! WOLOLO Age of empires 4 confirmed!!
"If you weren't terribly attached to this game in your childhood then I would find it hard to recommend. It has dated quite significantly (things like path finding are really annoying), but the graphics and sounds are pretty good even to this day.  But if you have played this game before and enjoyed it, or want to see one of the most influential strategy games of gaming history, look no further. AoE2 is truly a landmark of the gaming industry. The single player tells interesting stories through campaigns (all well designed), and the multiplayer offers endless replayability. Lots of different maps, civs, game-modes, teams etc. to play around with!  If you're not a strategy fan though, then stear clear.  This is an oldie, but a goldie.   Also the HD edition barely changed a thing and pretty much is a rip-off. I guess playing online via steam is the only good thing about it."
I love this game
"Wonderful game. The gameplay is very similar to the original, but this version is a little laggier it seems with player movement. I liked the graphics of the original better as well. I like the addition of the expansion packs, although I have not used them yet. I did like the original better. It stopped working on my machine though."
just like when i was a kid but looks so much cleaner and runs faster!
"Ahhh the memories,   Pro: Never get's old, strategy is endles Con:bought for online but few people still play  Start paying already so i can go against randoms rather then friends! :-) "
A classic slice of strategy and fun! It's old but still so much fun to play.  7/10
"Third campaign of the Genghis Khan. The Mongols come to conquer China, and the Chinese are like..'We can beat the Mongols by erecting a Wonder.' And the Mongols are like..'Oh no! we are screwed."
"Whenever I see the words 'Age of Empires' plastered on a product, I usually get this sudden pain in my chest and it wont go away unless I purchase said product. This game in particular was an exception... I had nearly died of a heart attack after the photons of light that consisted of this product had hit my retina. I proceeded to fart and puke simultaneously out of sheer excitement whilst attempting to purchase this game. Once I clicked that little green button to confirm my purchase I thought that would fix my current dilemma but I was wrong. Once clicked, Steam had redirected me to my game library and there I had laid my eyes on the words 'Age of Empires 2: HD.' My brain could not comprehend the letters HD and the words Age of Empires 2 put into a single sentence so I proceeded to have a stroke and was stuck back in the vortex of my uncontrollable flatulence/vomit combination. That truly was the best day of my life."
"If you have some Fin to play with, it rocks boys .. You can get one on  www.fintze♥♥♥♥♥es.com "
It's Age of Empires II.  One of the greatest RTS games of all time. Probably don't need to say any more about it than that.
"Still one of the leading RTS games, a completely timeless game and will always have endless gameplay fun. "
"If you like any strategy game then you'll like this. The tech trees are easy to follow and the historical campaigns offer an interesting challenge to anyone and in my opinion, can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys strategy games.   The A.I. can become a little weird and for whatever reason will give up after they make so many units. I have had experiences where on easy the A.I. suddenly decideds to go all out and launch a massive unified attack and i have seen the hard setting just decide that they need to die and send villagers in leaving all the warriors behind to do nothing.   I still like it as it has nostalgia for me from the windows 98 days."
"Best Strategy game of all time. Its still great, better than AOE 3 (actually works online) If you don't own any strategy games yet. This is the only one that you should definitely have.  I have played this game for much longer at the time when Steam didn't even exist. Now with Steam features like achievements and workshop, its even better.  When its on sale, its totally worth to buy it."
This was my childhood..
"I LIKE THIS GAME ,"
awesome and classic.If you are looking for the perfect classic strategy game then play this game.
Loved it as a kid and I still love it.
"Relive your childhood. Unfortunately the multiplayer is pretty laggy, not sure what's up with that but it's borderline unplayable at times."
It's a classic.
The memories... I almost cried when i start this game... Its good old time AOE II but with better graphics. Its masterpiece of strategies and it always will be.
I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS GAME I PLAYED IT SINCE I WAS A LITTLE YOUNGER I LOVE BUILDING A BASE AND JUST TEAMING OP ATTACKING AND ALL THAT 
"Age of empires is a good game, but the hd edition has so many bugs in multiplayer, The devs are money greedy ♥♥♥♥♥ releasing expansions while the main game is still bugged."
"Greatest game ever. Balanced civs, fantastic graphics, many civilizations to play."
Great game! Never played a better one!
Just as good as it was years ago &lt;3 10/10
Wololo
Great game. Well executed additional civs and techs.
Only mines gold. Only builds monks.  This game is a classic. 11/10 would Wololo again.
"this is the game where you throw history to the wind and have the mongols do battle with aztecs. history is silly anyhow, and it's good to mess with it. shake things up!  there are also new expansions where you can live the dream of ethiopia conquering japan."
"By far one of the best RTS games in existence, and mods too! ZOMG!"
When you think RTS this is what should come to mind.
"I spent hundreds of hours playing this game as a child. Age of Empires II was probably the first computer game I have ever played and now I spend hundreds of hours wishing I had the time to play it as much as I used to. If you want to know how do you tell if a game is quality, well Age of Empires II was released in 1999 and it STILL has a huge following and very active support, the last expansion pack came out recently and it introduced a myriad of new civilizations and technologies."
Buy this in a sale for a few hours of nostalgic fun!
It's practically the greatest RTS ever made. This game has amazing balance.
"First and Best RTS out there that I've ever played, will always love this game and go back to it when in need of some rts fun!!! First computer game i really played and will always be my first love. A classic for sure."
"If you want to have a life, don't play CBA. There is no going back."
"Best RTS Strategy game out there. You really have to work on your strategy to succeed against the harder AIs and I love the challenge. Also, it is super easy to play multiplayer with your friends. Everything about this game is awesome!"
"Oh the memories this brins back. Sure, there are better RTS games out there today, but since it is one of the first games I've ever played, I simply couldn't resist. Well worth the money"
Still one of the best RTS
Great game. I remember playing it when i was younger. now i can replay and enjoy the historical games and playing death matches with friends online.
"What can i say? one of the best RTS of the world, a masterpiece from microsoft. And with the new upgrade and the 'hd' resolutions it works very well with any resolution :)"
Best Game Ever !! However needs some help with multiplayer desync's and lag. :(
simply amazing to go back to my old childhood days love this game.
"This game has been a favorite of mine since October of 1995, when I got it for my 6th birthday. I haven't put it down yet. and the HD version is excellent"
"Great game with many fun game modes. can be fun for anyone, give it a try :)"
"Bought the game and now it is literally unplayable. When I launch the game a 'validating subscriptions' screen appears, and then the game shuts down. Have tried multiple fixes and reinstallations."
"Very fun to play with friends, really boring to play alone."
"AWesome game i love it, great classic game."
The games good gah get off my back
"Age of the Empires II is a timeless classic. In general I would highly recommend this game. If you already own the original Age of Empires II, however, I'm not sure if its worth the investment. There are surely mods available to provide the gameplay added and packeged by steam. This applies to the additional content too, I imagine. Furthermore, the improved graphics doesn't eliminate the fact that the game appears a bit dated, but it makes the in-game experience a little bit better.  Nonetheless the inexpensive asking price, the quality of the game, and the lack of time and effort required in acquiring these mods make me content with the investiment.  Finally, I might recommend 0 AD, as this appears to be the next generation of what AOE started. Tis 3D and incorporates the spirit of the AOE and AOE II games."
"Exceptional RTS Game. Wonky game engine, otherwise a perfect game."
A classic strategy game. I recommend to download it. Its the perfect game to play when you want to challenge your overall intellect.
"So this is an old classic for me and I grew up playing Age of empires 2, along with many other RTS games growing up. This game is still my favorite and even now I hop on for a random game every now and then. The graphics have been improved and I do enjoy that. I also feel like the random map and multiplayer portion has been improved and I do enjoy the new campaigns, not so much the new empires. My only problem with the HD edition so far is that it crashes(for me) when I try to make a random map with only the original empires.  Still all around a great game. If you enjoyed other RTS such as C&amp;C then you will defenetly enjoy the age of empires series"
It's a fun game to play i guess
Ive bene playing this game since High School and still enjoy it. One of my favorite games.
"I've been a fan of the Age of Empires series since way back in 1998. And Age of Empires 2 and its expansion the Conquerors is the best of the whole line, including Age of Mythology. HD adds some much needed graphics so that we can enjoy an old game on higher resolution monitors, whereas 'The Forgotten' and 'African Kingdoms' add some new civilizations and tech, along with some game rebalancing leading to some more variations to an already incredible game. Being Indian, I am only disappointed in the representation of Indians in the game. While the villager cost reduction bonus allows an amazing boom opportunity, I dislike how it continues the Age of Empires 3 trend of Indians having no heavy horse. The uniques are sorely lacking, with Elephant Archer being an inferior ranged unit, hardly worth the expense, and Imperial Camel, which only barely allows it to match up to the heavy cavalry line of troops. Not to mention the poorly written Prithviraj Chauhan campaign. Overall, finding my country underwhelming makes me a little less enthusiastic about the Forgotten as a whole, but that's a small qualm while facing the many hours of enjoyment one can gain from this game."
"I will never get tired of this game, it only gets better with time!  There’s not much I want to say about this game. It is what it is. It has its flaws but overall I think it’s very balanced and polished game with a lot of content.  Fantastic game! I still play it now and then and I love the nostalgic feel to it.   10/10"
"It's not as great as thr original AoE, but AoE2 fills the void and is still worth playing."
"i Grew up with this game, remembered how my dad used to kick my ♥♥♥ in it.  With the HD Edition everything seems better, atleast now i can play Age of Empire without those Black Bars on the sides and i am very happy with the increased Population limit. The Forgotten DLC is worth it, since it adds a Bigger size map and since then i dont use anything smaller.  This is the best RTS in history!"
"The old good one from my childhood ! Amazing ! Just amazing ! Still good so many years after ... It's this kind of game that doesn,'t get old because ... It's a masterpiece ! Great music, good system (but a little bit old of course), great strategic game !"
This game was my childhood and it's still a great game even today :D
grew up playing this game and if memory holds it is most likely the first game i ever played
"AOE 2 and Life is feudal:forest village is the games prefer right now, but I must say AOE is a must have. And if your interested in making villages you should try Feudal is life:forest village.  {LINK REMOVED}  https://www.♥♥♥.com/r/lifeisfeudal-forestvillage "
"If you ever played this as a kid, it is worth getting again. Basically another expansion for an already great game! Don't expect to win if you try muliplayer, not if you didn't play with your friends before. Would highly recommend. The one new campaign that I tried (there are more than that, but I had also just purchased borderlands 2) was practically impossible without cheats. (which I still knew by heart because of the sheer number of times I used them as a youngling) One thing that I seemed to notice was that the path finding was a little off from what it used to be. It may have just been in my head, but they seemed particularly unintelligent. Not too game-hindering though. Would still highly recommend. P.S. You know a game is good when there is an expansion released 13 years after the previous one and people love it."
"  Whether by yourself or playing with friends, AoE2 is always a classic when it come to RTS action. The easy to use Map Editor is also one of the best I've used."
"I have just bought this game, and then downloaded it on my computer. It is now saying 'Game failed to initilize Steam. You must have Steam running. No file line information.' I have Steam opened and logged in while wanting to play it. I have tried restarting my laptop, and it is still telling me the same thing. Do you know what I can do to open it?"
"Love this game, yet still suck at it :P"
Errrrr.... How do I turn this on?
My first Age of Empires game was 'Age of Empires Online' which me and my friends loved. Unfortunately the servers for that game shut down in 2014 and we have been looking for a replacement game ever since. During this years summer sale we decided to pick this game up to fill the role of 'Age of Empires Online' and it sort of worked. It isn't as enyoable as AoEO but is so much more versitile when it comes to the multiplayer maps and the game options.
I let William Wallace get eaten by a bear.  10/10   would break history again.
"One of the greatest RTS I've ever played. Played it way back in the day, before steam."
"I remember playing this game when it first came out. It is as fantastic now as it was then, but with better graphics. I'm playing through it again but this time, there's 2 new campaigns! just onto the conquerer's campaign. playing through it again is giving me such nostalgia!!! So excited to play again. would recommend to everyone who loves any age of empires game, or indeed age of empires 2 to get this! worth the money, or get in the sale! :D"
F-ing dope bruewhs. New AI is actually good and multiplayer works like a champ.
"Excellent improvements to the base game, particularly the new campaings for African civs."
"Age of Empires was one of the first games I ever got into, and I loved it; Age of Kings took everything awesome about AoE1 to the next level. Even today, long after its original release, this game is a really, really fun RTS with pretty robust, engaging, (and educational) campaigns, as well as really fun multiplayer. GREAT for LAN parties. It's totally worth picking up.  What other game unashamedly lets you use 40 elite longbowman to tear a castle down from beyond its defensive range? Come on. It's a blast."
"As good as it was in my childhood but with the simplicity of the Steam Hub. Nervertheless, a little bit too expensive for the content (DLCs...)"
Good ol' Age of Empires.
"Played this game alot before the HD edition was released on Steam. Overall a fantastic game. There is still an active online community. As well as some great youtubers who review games played by competitive players (bbqturkman comes to mind). There is lots of strategy involved, but the game doesnt evolve much through the different ages. Theres only 4 different ages, and they are all medieval ages, which isnt a problem for me, but games like Empire Earth or even 4X games like Civilization span from the dark ages all the way to the futuristic ages, which is something this game doesnt feature. Great purchase, often on sale, pick it up if youre looking for a great RTS game."
THE ONE AND ONLY RTS!!
"A timeless classic of an RTS game, still as fun as I remembered the original version was back in 1999! 10/10 would definitely recommend!"
the good ol days lol great game !!
Fantastic! I had this game when I was 10 glad to see it rereleased on Steam.
I like this game but i find it vary frustrating when i click the play now button for the game and nothing happens...
"This is the pinnacle of strategy games. I was introduced to this game about 12 years ago. Like most, I first played Wallace's tutorial campaign, and struggled for ~3 hours to beat the Battle of Falkirk. After countless hours of playing (probably about 2,000), and many defeats and victories, I can provide testimony; this game is as good and beautiful as strategy games can get. It has many flaws, but these get quickly overshadowed by its charms. If you're in for hours of planning and execution, battles and economy, war and truce, get this. The expansions are amazing as well. Favorite battles: Vinlandsaga (732 A.D.), The Battle of Tours (1066 A.D.), Barbarossa Campaign and Montezuma Campaign."
"Online coop does not work, latency is crazy bad. Both parties on fiber, does not matter.   It's an ok single player game, but so is the original."
"I haven't found anything to hate about AoE II, aside from some connectivity issues and the high price. It plays as good, and even better, than many modern RTS games. If you liked before, you will still like it."
"Instant classic. Many good texture mods in the workshop for this game. If you played this a long time ago when it came out for endless hours, buy the full HD game, get all the mods you want off the work shop, and hop into a custom game. Don't bother with online MP until you take time to learn economy and macromanaging strats because no matter the match up you will get rolled. I still have a blast just playing against AI on different difficulty settings. The campaigns can be fun to if you're into that. Also runs on a potatoe as well as on a beast spec PC without fail. If you can't run it, I suggest getting a new set up."
"Today i couldn't get in the solo game. He stays on: Waiting for players...  But otherwise,  great game"
Reliving my younger days ftw! You just can't go wrong with nostalgia!
"Great game, favourite game since i was a kid and also a great time passer. 10/10"
this game is loads of fun for those who love history and even those who don't because you get to play as your favorite civilizations
How is this game still fantastic 13 years since I first played it. (Nostalgia might have a role in it)
"Age of Empires II finally comes back to us.  After the travesty that was Age of Empires III, I am glad we got a remastered version of Age of Empires II. It still has the nostalgic look and feel, so I would recommend it for people who played it back when it first came out. However, newcomers will probably better appreciate other games with better graphics and AI."
"This game never grows old. I even prefer it to AoE III. The achievements are plenty, and though some are challenging, none are so difficult as to be unobtainable."
Best game. Multiplayer 10/10. Map editor 10/10 Use it all the time so Easy.  BEST GAME BUY AND PLAY IT.
This is the best historical strategy game ever made 
Childhood memories piled up in an exquisite game which has survived through the ages. Love it!
Yo let me play this on Mac tho dawg.
The best RTS.
"The graphics update is great. The multiplayer is fun. If you're into this sort of thing, you're probably a nerd, but that's okay. I don't know if there's any real benefit or wow factor in this game but, it's mindless yet invigorating. Good for the blossoming ADHD kid."
"Some recent update ♥♥♥♥ed up the game by deleting some important temp folders, keeping you from playing anything in single player, either story campaign or custom stories."
Wololo.  A classic RTS from the great age of the genre.
Ten outta ten strategy game right here.     - A guy on the Internet.
I remember buying this game for 2 dollars on ebay when I was like 5 years old and being so excited that I could finally play a game on our ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2003 gateway.
"Really good game, enjoyed a whole bunch, best played multiplayer, if u came here for campaign go get age of empires III, dosent hae that good of gameplay or graphics, and when i say gameplay i mean the characters movements are a little choppy, but i say that dosent matter its still a great game.  10/10 would reccomend this game."
"10/10 runs on windows 7, 8, 9, and 10. Would reccomend."
Its a great fun game to waste time and make ur friends hate eacher other by trolling them!
I grew up with this game but now due to the DLC's i find my self getting ym clan members and friends to buy it. Amazing game still
"One of the best RTS games ever made. Remastered in HD. Amazing still, less likely to work on your Windows 95 machine."
"Old school classic map play, brings back all childhood memories  10/10"
It is still the best game!
"Don't buy this game. It is full of bugs ( Two very common: 1. farms exhuasts while they still have food, 2. enemies pass through walls) and it's AI is so broken that even in medium difficulty is unbeatable. ( I used to win vs hardest in the non HD version)."
I love this game I played it a lot when I owned it on CD I play it when I have nothing to do but anyways I recommend it
"one of the great games, not sure what is HD about it. Buy on sale and stow it in your library. Aquire goats."
Absolute classic game. I'm glad the community is still alive and enjoys this great game now in HD.
Respect the classic.
The best one of the Age Of Empires series in my opinion. A classic game that can be enjoyed by everyone. The new additions and updates are nice too. A new feel to an old game. They dont make them like they used too.
"if you have age of empires 3 or like real time strategy (RTS) games, you should get this! Fun game! 8.5/10"
"Feels like you have to be a masochist to play this game as a beginner, because it's REALLY tough to get into (atleast when playing multiplayer).  Despite that, I really enjoyed my (short) time getting owned."
Wololo
"Greatest game ever. Balanced civs, fantastic graphics, many civilizations to play."
Great game! Never played a better one!
Great game. Well executed additional civs and techs.
"5/5 When a 15 year old game get's it's own HD remake there's a reason for it, some times you think i'd love to play that game again I played as a child, only to find you don't enjoy it like you did back then. Not the case with AOE2, puts many modern strat games to shame. Others have tried but I don't think any have managed to make such a simple strategic game quite as well as AOE did. Still very popular online too."
"One of my favourite childhood games, I am extremely happy it is on Steam, I only wish we could get the first one as well."
Wololololo in HD.....enough said....
"The original that brings back memories, perfectly organized true strategy that started the focus on another aspects of gameplay."
This has been my most favorite game since i was 10 wish they would make a new one it would be pretty awesome
"Wololo! You still don't play in this game? Ok, lets try one more time: WOLOLO! Now everything should be ok."
When you think RTS this is what should come to mind.
"In my opinion the best RTS game. Yeah better than Starcraft. I love Starcraft but man I played AOE II A LOT as a kid. There is a huge amount of strategy involved, lots of civilizations to play as, each with a unique unit and bonuses, and a bunch of hilarious memes. The game was and is still popular. Go play it!  Wolololo"
Fun game. Takes me back many years when i invested far too much time in the original game. Thumbs up from Hibby
new twist on a great classic game. Plus size. wit a PHat
Best RTS ever! I totally recommend for the true fans and veteran players. Amazing to have an expansion after 20 years.
I've only played it for a little bit. The game is pretty decent.
"Best Wolololo Simulator on the market. 9/10 monks recommend this game! No seriously, when I played this game as a kid it was great and it still is. You can't do anything wrong if you spend your money on this game."
Amazing game. One of the few Microsoft classics. I'm surprised this game didn't die out a long time ago
It was so sad when my sheep went into an enemy's territory and defected :(
"If its on steam sale, you can buy it. Otherwise wait.  It fixes some issues and adds workshop support for easier mod installment, but its totally not worth 20 bucks (excluding the DLC)."
It is as enjoyable as the original version. I felt that the graphics were not really 'modernized' to the point of where I would call it HD. It runs smooth however and was updated for modern systems. If you liked the original then you will like this.
played MP after a few rounds VS the PC.  Got my ♥♥♥ kicked in 200~ hours worth of rounds.  10/10 would be terrible at game again.
"WELL, I SPENT TEN MINUTES FORMATTING A REVIEW BUT MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MODEM RESET ITSELF AND I LOST IT (literally and emotionally). SO HERE IS MY NEW, REVISED REVIEW:    it's alright"
"haha,my childhood game.time to wololo"
just like i remember from when i was a kid
Fun game. Can play for hours and not get board.
This is one of the greatest real time strategy games ever made. Age of Empires needs to make a comeback and put all these new RTS games to shame. Proud to say I grew up playing the AOE series and it is the franchise that got me into PC gaming.
Old but gold!
legend/masterpiece dlc is a bit expensive tho
"One of the first PC game I've ever played.  I love this game, even though the devs seem to not care when a bug happens until a next large update.  Still a great game though!"
  Recommended.  
I played this as a kid. Neat to be able to play it again!
"Well, what else is there really to say about this classic? It is a well polished game, still played a lot to this day and the HD rerelease includes two completely new subsets of civilizations and campaigns.   I personally got back into a through the youtuber 'Spirit of the Law', whose video about viable strategies helped me rediscover the depths possible."
"Brings me back to when i was 10. The HD and the mods make it playable and probably the best game im playing right now, is that sad?"
"The best AoE game enhanced for modern systems with new, much more powerful, AI and new civilizations.  It works pretty well, but it could use a few more updates/enhancements. For example, there is no possibility of restarting an online game or saving a megarandom map. Also, when it 'desyncs' during an online match, it can't be restored anymore – it used to work before, but I think it's been broken since one of the 4.something updates. There are some occasional hiccups here and there, sometimes it freezes for a few seconds and then goes back to normal.  Considering these problems, I would still recommend it to both newcomers and seasoned players who grew up on the original version."
"So good, I missed my flight at the airport because I was playing it"
Very fun strategy game. 10/10 would buy again.
"Good gameplay, looks a lot better, the Expansion packs are kind-of needed tho if not your game is just HD Really..."
It turns me into a kid but they do not improve a lag problem. Anyway it is a good game and i think they probably make this game great again.
AoE II made me love strategy games.
"How my first play through went:  -Played as the Britons  -Built up a wall around my base  -Ally protected me till I was in the fifth age  -Really glad I played AoE 1 and 3  -Built castles everywhere  -Got attacked while my ally was away  -Castles slaughtered small enemy force  -Realized I could get really op archers from castle, got 300 of them in short order due to great economy  -Really glad I am economics pro in everything I do  -My allies attacking army gets vanquished  -Enemies decide to kill me first  -Gets a huge invasion launched on me while ally is armyless  -Archers shred enemy army and double wall helps  -Launches invasion with just archers not knowing what I am doing  -Enemies call foul on the fact I am beating them with archer army  -Enemies get really mad that I used no seige equipment  -Ally is staring slack jawed at my sudden asencion from newbie to team leader  -Enemies are starting slack jawed at my skill  -Vanquishes one enemy, moves on to next without replenishing my army  -Ally tries to help, gets slaughtered and falls to a counter-attack  -I get counter attacked, had 200 spare archers laying about  -I beat other dude while his army was away with my other 200 remaining archers  TL;DR great game. ∞/10"
cheese steak jimmy's robin hood lumberjack rock on how do you turn this on furious the monkey boy i r winner  heheheheheeeeeee
i love this game i have been involved with the series since the first one. for some reason the other day how ever i cant load the game it keeps crashing and idk y 
"May be old but the remastered version gives me nerd-gasms. LOVE THIS GAME 10/10, and way better then civ. (My opinion)"
Multiplayer is crap. Else ok.
The best Game Ever!!! No doubt about it.
Thank you for this!!!!!!!!!!
"I am not alone when I write that this is probably one of the greatest and well known retro RTS titles of all time. For me at least, Age of Empire II has not been overshadowed by any other RTS game I have played, and has truely endured the test of time. I have literally spent years playing the non-steam version of this. If you like a good RTS, just buy this and take it for a spin. You will not be disappointed."
So good! Wish they had updated more with the HD like better villager control but this is a classic!
"Just a relaunch of an old game.  Gameplay is still great, although quite dated now  Hopefully, enough sales will convince microsoft to develop Age of Empires IV (Instead of its facebook/online versions of the game)"
"Age of Empires II: HD is a remastered version of one of best RTS games of its time. The HD remaster version allows you to play the game at a HD resolution, with graphics that have been improved a bit, but overall its still looks the same. Its great opportunity for old fans of the series to replay it and for new ones to try one of most influential titles of RTS genre.   The game inclues The Conquerors expansion, so there are two campaigns with many hours of singleplayer playtime. All the campaigns based on historical events and tells the story of some the worlds greatest battles. They are well made and enjoyable to play through. Multiplayer has also been improved with the steam integration with a universal ladder system, which can add an endless amount of hours to playtime.  Unfortunately, there are still some minor issues here and there. The one that have anoyed me the most, is the movement/pathfinding of units. Somestimes some of units just stops or they all decides to take a longer path. There can also be problems with moving through more narrow openings, where they just stop infront of it, if you dont set the movement point right behind it.  Overall its still a great game and if you a fan of Age of Empires its a nice remake, that gives you the chance to replay the game."
Very Addictive games. It is a really good game.
"I have to say , AoE II was one of my favorite games of all time back in the day. This HD version is so worth the money. Thank you. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Age of Empires, RTS games, or classic games.,"
Aoe !!!!! What shall i say. A game that i played when i was 8 / 9 years old. This game kindled my interest towards RTS genre. A beautiful game that enables us to experience building and create an empire while managing resources. The funny thung is that i used to think i was the best person to play these games until i bought it on STEAM and got REKT in matchmaking against intermediate pros with elo score of 1600. Overall its a great game that everyone play.
its ok
Timeless classsic with endless hours of enjoyment!
this game is so HD that everything is so tiny I cant even see what the units are doing..  I remember this game being so HD back in the 90s that you can actually see the tiny guy using his bow and arrow. I do have windows 10 and a alienware 13 inch laptop. but I have used high resolution and low resolution and its still unplayable to me.   this copy seems very funky to me compared to the original ages empire 2.
"Another game i loved growing up, love to have the HD version of the game, great with friends, and aginst ai. 800/10"
"Brings back so many non-existent childhood memories that everyone else seemed to have, but I somehow missed out on. 10/10, would recommend"
5/5 Fav pc game of all time
Very Classic!
JD always wins
Classic.
Playing this brings me back to Grade 12 where I would play this on LAN during classes when everyone had finished their assignments 6 weeks early.
Best gosh darn RTS ever!
"old time haha, thanks valve to bring this back"
"played this when i was a little kid about 5 years old in 2000s now i can play it again but its nostalgia reasons why its great. let me tell you why this is one of the best rts and why RTS SUCK TODAY.   first off this game unlike most rts clones today is verry indepth and you can actually see the batte of your troops fighting not stupid txt saying 2k troops died XX amount returned etc no none of that lazy crap. here you control and see the combat of your men as the burn the villages etc  you also have to pay attention to food, gold,wood,stone, people cap, etc but unlike (again other crappy rts clones) you actually gotta go and find this stuff not build a house and afk for 8 hours.  heres a bigger reason. this game also is not pay to win either which is a hugeeeeee thing since all rts today are p2w garbage not to mention they all seem to be mobile for some reason. aside from world of warcraft 3 frozen throne this is one of the best rtses of all time and i reall would like to see a new one    AS A LAST NOTE i HIGHLY reccomend this to any rts fan. its almost hard to find a more indepth rts game then this"
"Awesome game, i didn't know it was still populair, i played this so much when i was young!"
Just buy the game
"EXPLAINING THE GAME:  It's like Starcraft when it comes to gamemechanics. You have some units that are better against other, and weaker against some. You have other units that are decent towards other units, and have no real weakness. If we're talking in terms of Starcraft, you have the units such as the Terran valkyrie, or in Starcraft II, the Protos Pheanix, both great against air, but very exposed towards ground. Then you have the well known marines, that are decent towards anything, but again, no strenght or weakness, In Age of Empires II you have the swordsmen, no pluss or minus, and the cav, good against swords, weak against spear. So as I mentioned, the mechanics are pretty much the same as Starcraft. But the concept is a bit different. You start in the dark age, and can chose to get up to the imperial age, giving you a lot of benefits in terms of military and economical strenght. In difference to Starcraft, economy plays a bigger role in Age of Empire II than it does in Starcraft. Age of Empires is more like the full RTS version of Rome: Total war, economy is just as important as anything else.   THE VERDICT:  So Age of Empires have it's simularities, which I think is great. But everything isn't fun if it is the same story again, and the developers have made sure to take that into considiration. Age of Empires features simple economy management, which plays a big role in the game. It's not hard to handle, but if you focuse to little on one resource, it sure will give a knockback when you really need those resources. To put it all in a easier way, you will like it like any other game, but it all comes down to the player, and if he likes to have a mix between settlers and starcraft.  "
"If you loved this game back in the day, this version and its new expansions are a must have! 10/10 seven asses.  The new AI is far tougher but if that's not your speed, the old AI is still there for the selecting. Multiplayer games are easier than ever. The graphics and texture mods available are amazing.   Seriously a great buy."
Cheap and legendary remake.
"Very Good game. First game I bought when I got Steam. Highly recommend this game to anyone, can play solo or in multiplayer. Just an overall very good game."
killed 20 skirms with one demolition ship. GG 11/11
"I've played this game since I was a kid (so around 15 years) and finally got around to buyinmg it again. I did purchase this with Ages of Empires 3 and I play this more than Ages of Empires 3. Absolutly great game and I wish I had actual players to fight against but regardless, there's no denying the wolololol"
Just as good as it was years ago &lt;3 10/10
Only mines gold. Only builds monks.  This game is a classic. 11/10 would Wololo again.
"this is the game where you throw history to the wind and have the mongols do battle with aztecs. history is silly anyhow, and it's good to mess with it. shake things up!  there are also new expansions where you can live the dream of ethiopia conquering japan."
"By far one of the best RTS games in existence, and mods too! ZOMG!"
It's a classic strategy game that you can play in so many different ways.
AOE2 is a classic and I'm thrilled they remastered it.   My only complaint is that the scenario editor only lets you max at 200pop (Skirmish max is now 500) and they have yet to fix it.
"Ok, this going to be a really long review. So bear with me. One of my favourite things about this game is how immersed I get. For example, I feel like the...  [Buy 'Whoo' by Rainbow on iTunes to read the rest of this review]"
Nostalgia with a touch of HD resolution and new dlcs
the first video game I've ever played...and I'm still garbage at it.
Best real-time strategy out there.
Feel the Bern
"Best RTS ever made.    Very good revamp for computers nowadays, especially if you have like 3 screens or your pc hooked to your flatscreen :)"
"This game has stolen a lot of hrs of my childhood xD Great, legendary game! Awesome game balance and pretty nice new Versions. Overall the best are the new patches and revision works."
classic great RTS great game  awesome remake
I recommend this game.
classic game in an awesome series of games now if only we could finally get an aoe4
its real good ay
Why does this game lag?
A tuns of fun with friends and family
"Childhood game that can compete against titles of today, seriously this is worth every penny!"
"Essentially, this was this game that hooked me into gaming. Dont let the amount of steam hours fool you, I have played this bad boy since I was 6 and many an argument has occured in the family because of it.  Cannot recommend this game enough!"
Best strategy game all of the time
"Age of Empires was the first game I got into as a child. It helped me through my studies, it helped me appreciate and understand History in a way that no other medium ever did and till this day I play the entire series even if I have to ISO it to play it! HD truly brought back my childhood and allowed me to enjoy new content that until now, I was previously unable to! Thank you HD team! :)"
Waist of ♥♥♥♥ing money the campaign progress keeps resetting and appearently im not the only one with this problem.
"This was my old review:  Very disappointing! Loved the original and was excited for some nostalgia gaming, but instead the program fails with an error every time. Claims that my system's GPU does not meet minimum requirements, which is absurd given it is using a newer nvidia card that runs much newer games with ease. Very shoddy work.  However, with recent updates it's now able to play on the same system. It's a major nostalgia trip to play this. If you were into this game the first time around, go for it. If this is your first time, some of it will probably seem primative. It's like watching old 'I love lucy' episodes. The stuff that seems old and tired now was slick and new when this came out."
"Great game, it costs a bit for how old it is but still very fun."
Ahh the memories
"Roses are Red, Your army is big, Wololo  My army"
Most Epic game of the century !
"Grew up playing this game and have loved every second of it. One of my all time favourite games, love the gameplay, the art is amazing, I love everything about this game. For how old this game is its absolutly amazing. 10/10"
"This game is really fun. I play it a lot, but it is probably better to get the third one instead of this one, unless you can't afford it was then get this one. 10/10"
This game pretty much raised me.
"The Grandfather of RTS. lLaying this years later, I still love this game.   Though I disagree with the price, it being so old a game."
Favorite game when I was a kid. Dont have many hours on steam but its a great game that I've logged at least a thousand hours before steam was even an idea. Great game for kids or for people just starting to game.
"I'll get straight to the point, this is one of the greatest real-time strategy game ever, there are many others but none like this one, this one is special but I have to admit that I prefer Age of Mythology over Age of Empires not only because I prefer mythology over medievial, I actually love both very much but especially because of a few changes, for example, you do not have to build a new farm every times it's dead, that's something I find pretty annoying. Still one of the greatest medieval game out there. I'd love to see the first one and the original version of this one on Steam. Age of Empires III is a good game but it is nothing compared to the first and second game, the expansion of the first one was great. I'd recommend this game to any medieval, real-time strategy or even Rise of Nations fans.  9/10"
"An excellent remaster and update for a classic that includes use of Steam matchmaking. If you played this game back before it was HD and enjoyed it; you will enjoy it all over again with the bonus of good AI, matchmaking, fun-to-hunt achievements, new factions, units, and a few strategies as rich as everything in your old CD-Rom discs you may have hidden somewhere still.  My only complaints are minor:  -There are no voiceovers and proper timing triggers (you have to click specific and highlight specific units rather than the advancment being automatic as in the others) in the campaigns in The Forgotten expansion giving them a rough and unfinished feel.  -The sheer number of available factions when you have both DLC's can make selecting one a long task when you're unfamiliar with the game or are returning from a long break. (This of course a non-issue when you're familiar with the game.)  Overal an excellent re-release of a classic and beloved RTS for modern systems with no 'updates' to the gameplay that some re-releases are the victims of."
Fat azz Can even pick up the og trial coastal map and mod it for relic sustain + high pop cap time of muh life.
"I put well over 200 hours or so into this game when I was younger, and it still holds up pretty well. Building your town into an empire and fending off attacking nations is stategic, challenging, and rewarding. I also enjoy creating my own maps, it really lets you get creative."
"Love it, just simply love it. the nostalgia boner is strong with this one"
always a good time playing
"Just as good as the old and even better. The multiplayer was while often getting kicked from the lobby annoying, still fun to be able to play more with other people. The AI has also been improved. If given a large amount of resources in a custom environment then they will be able to rush with paladins and trebuchets, meaning even if you have 10 castles producing teutonic knights and halberdiers everywhere then you'll still have a tough time!"
"THe best strategy game till date. There is so much built intot his game that it can never get old. My frinds play at least about 5-6 game in one session and believe m, a game is quite long in most cases. The multiplayer element is a constant bounty land while the single player campaigns are a crash course in history."
Childhood memories revisited.
I lovin' it!
"I've nominated this game for the 'The Test of Time Award'. Since its release in 1999 (2000 for 'The Conquerors Expansion') it has been one of my most favorite games to go to. I've spent countless hours playing the (original) campaigns, numerous of random maps and a lot of user-created scenarios and campaigns, and I'll happily continue to do so with this HD re-release of the original classic.   Both the DLC packs 'The Forgotten' and 'The African Kingdoms' are worth it too and are a very nice addition to the original game.  Be aware though, that playing this game in multiplayer can be laggy. Patches (trying) to resolve this (and other bugs) are coming out on an irregular base (the latest patch as of writing is 4.8 beta).  All in all, I do recommend this game."
"Well, if you played the classic version pick this one, its really wonderfull that such an old game still have an online comunity"
Brinbs back the nostalgia... GREAT GAME BUT HOW DO YOU TUNR THIS ON?
"Works like a charm, multiplayer games are hassle free with new Steam invite feature. Game in itself is just as great as it was back in the day."
"If you're thinking about buying this game, DO IT. It was a childhood favorite and now some friends and I are reliving our childhood playing together. Get this one, not Age of Empires 3."
"One of my favorite games from childhood, and now i can play it again... GREAT! Remastering in HD in some things doesnt really feels ok, BUT game is CLASSIC MASTERPIECE, that every self-respected rts player must try! Also there is some new stuff ( not talking for the expansions) but the population can be 500 (instead of the old 200) , for way more epicness.  Ah another thing for Age of Empires II, this game is like a history lesson, so if you like to know more medieval history, definetely get this one, you play and learn at same time. :)"
Great game to play with friends
"Love this game, especially when your mate secretly builds an army and destroys my ♥♥♥ like the backstabbing ♥♥♥ he is. 11/10"
"This game is amazing. Every society has something to like about it, there is alot campaign if you like that kind of thing, and there are plenty of difficulties, modes, and ways to tweak each match to your liking."
"Age of Empires II is a great Real Time Strategy ('RTS') game. The only issue is that the Difficulty settings are a mess in my opinion. Even with Original AI or new AI, if I play Easy or Moderate, it's too easy. If I play Standard or higher, its too difficult. This game if fun with multiplayer -- I have a friend I game with once every 6-8 weeks and its enjoyable. I'd give it a solid 9.2/10, regardless of the difficulty issue."
Many late hours spent playing with friends and the cause of many LAN parties. Also the cause of some feuds.
I was recommended to get this game from a friend and in one day I put 7 hours into it. This game is fantastic. I don't think it is worth $20 dollars but its definitely worth $10 or below. If you have a friend or two who would buy the game with you then I say that it is worth the $20 dollars.
"If you are an old lover to the franchise of the AoE-series then this HD edition will feel perfect for you. Atleast when it comes to the multiplayer and playing standard game. Sadly it have much to look into, I have compared my original version to this and the maping of units are simply terrible. Have had tradecarts getting stuck in trees when they should go around and so forth. But that is mostly it for standard/multiplay.  The new Campaigns thought is just terrible, fantastic ideas but when you look on the maps and missions they leave much that the old ones have. If truly feels like someone have thrown something into the map editior and pulled it out noticing that half the content is missing. 'They won't notice' seems to be the reaction.  Even for those two crucial things, I am having a nostalgic trip that made me bring forth my old one for some fun comparison and to continue to play this, love it and hope that they will polish it a bit!"
"Age of Empires II (and all its dlc)  This game means alot to me, it was the first real game i played when i was around 10 years old.  Ofcource i didn't understand at all what i had to do, but i played this game so incredibly much back then.  I remember spamming the British because they could outrange castles with their longbows, man that was fun.  But now i bought this game on steam, and i am actually able to understand the game. I never used to be able to playn the campains because my English was just to bad, but now it is an enjoyable and educatif ride through the middle ages. The AI makes the random games fun and channeling, and i still have no idea how to win a multiplayer battle.  In other words, 45 hours in I am enjoying this game immensly and i have alot of room for improvement left. This game presents a challenge and has alot of depth to it.  I have also played AoE 1 and AoE III with all it's expantions and think this one is the best one. But if you are easly bugged by old graphics, AoE III might be better, but for depth and length i think this is the best game in the franchise.  Thanks for reading."
The “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award  Sheep Scouts - Just sayin'
"  I played the original Age of Empires II endlessly as a child. Seeing it remastered is an absolute joy, and it hasn't lost any of its allure. It's a great RTS with enough difficulty to be challenging, but with a fairly easy learning curve that doesn't leave you scratching your head as to how to keep things going right. The addition of updated multiplayer for Steam seals the deal: for the first time I can play with another human being easily, and it's glorious, medieval fun. I received this game as a gift on Steam but owned the original on CD back in the day. Nothing gameplay-wise has changed."
"'Recommend' is putting it mildly. Between the expansions, the workshop, and AoK Heaven, there is nearly an endless amount of content and a great quantity of it is of extremely high quality and originality.  Put simply: I have enjoyed every single hour I've put into this game, and regret none of them. This game scores a 6.0 on a 4.0 grade scale.  Warning: Certain studies suggest this game may cause (social) life threatening conditions. You may see a sharp rise in your electric bill. This game is known to the state of California to cause Vitamin-D deficiency. Some players experience sudden and uncontrollable outbursts of rage while playing Age of Empires. Age of Empires may cause habit-forming use of caffeine. If, while on this game, you forget to sleep more than twice a week, contact a chiropractor as it is likely you have developed carpal tunnel. You shoud not play Age of Empires if you have a job, attend school, or frequently interact with friends. Players with a history trebuchet addiction should not play Age of Empires, as it may increase the likelihood of abuse. If you are experiencing strategic difficulties, you may be elligible for YouTube-assistance.   Contact the Steam Store today  to see if Age of Empires is right for you  because there isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Age of Empires is not for you."
"A great game for killing time. Playing a skirmish type game against 1 pc controlled race could have you sinking hours into it. Aoe II: HD Edition may be a bit tricky to get the hang of especially if you don't really play many RTS style games but it's really a trial and error, and every single time you lose a match you end up switching your strategy to prevent that from happening again. It's all really something you have to learn. When you do eventually get better and get all the timing down (like when to attack, or advance to a new age), leading a conquest can be pretty fun and gets addictive!"
Regarding the 4.8 beta patch...just tried it! AND IM OVER THE MOON!!!!!!!!!!! thankyou thankyou thankyou! AOE 2 HD is playable now! didnt have any 'lag/desync' i had like 20 villagers all working on my screen and didnt foul up once! goodbye social life and hello highly defensible positions in blackforest!.........
"FORGET ABOUT THE TOWN CENTRE!!!!!! JUST KEEP THE LAST VILLAGER ALIVE(AND A BOAT), YOU CAN REBUILD YOUR KINGDOM. 20/10 VILLAGERS IS OVERPOWERED"
A relly good RTS game.
Definitely a game you should try if you never played it before.
"Age of Empires II is still as deep and addictive as before, and new HD version is a brilliant addition for fans who have been waiting for an upgrade to the old strategy classic. Despite beeing a 17 years old game (damn has it realy been that long?). The mechanics still holds up and the new Steam integration works great."
"Pure Nostalgia, and its just as good as it was back then!"
The worst but also the best HD version of an old game
been playing this game since it first came out in the 1990s and I still love it!
"maybe the best game ever, 5/5."
"For me thats still one of the best game, but i dont really like that i has to pay for new update(African Kingdoms). Game is good btw ;P"
love this game so much mods also bring so much more into this game
Really loved wih this game. Remind me of my childhood
One of legendary games. Worth to play
"I have loved AOE II for such a long time. Seeing it on sale for so cheap, I bought it up right away. Even if you are not a big RTS fan, give this one a shot. It is a masterpiece! :)"
"The mechanics and gameplay of the AOE series were seminal in the development of the modern RTS. Age of Empires II is arguably the best iteration. When I saw that this game was up for re-release, I had to snap it up for multiplayer alone. Still fun after nearly two decades... They just don't make 'em like they used to!"
Ye its good stuff
Awesome.... One of my fav Strategy game ever
This game will  never  get old. I appreciate that they implemented a relative stable multiplayer. +ELO-rating +Soundtrack  brings GOOD OLD TIMES back!! 
"A normal Age game: medieval era cars with machine guns, a really ubffed monkey, hitting castles with hammers till they set on fire, wololo some trebuchets to cristianism, send troops to enemy land to steal sheeps, garrison an elephant on a ship..."
ahh old days...  One of the best Strategy Game ever.  If you don't have it then buy it.  If you never played it then start to play right now !
Very fun game to play with friends but my laptop broke down so I fixed my old iMac (don't have money) and apperently it's not available on Mac. I would rate this 9/10 just because it's not available for me D':

Excellent in every way.
great game
"--- Long review incoming ---  - Short version -  Age of Empires II is still damn awesome after so many years. Even if you can notice it's age (geddit? huehuehue) it's a classic that has stand up to the test of time. If you are a veteran or new to Real-Time strategy games, Age of Empires II will not dissapoint.  - Short version ends here - --------------------------------------------  Even if it's been nearly a decade since I played it, and even more since it was realeased, there's no doubt why Age of Empires II is still one of the RTS games that is still played even today, and with new life brought with the HD edition there's even more to enjoy. Even though you can see clearly how it has aged, comapred to other games of the same and similar genre, AoE II gives you hours of fun, frustration, planning and enjoyment. I was way too young when I played this to really understand it and appreciate it to it's fullest, but since then I knew this was a gem and throughout the years I still found myself wanting to play this again and not even just out of nostalgia. And now, I can remember and re-discover an all time classic once again. If your new to RTS games or an ol' ♥♥♥ veteran, you can always count on AoE II for an awesome game that just keeps on giving, even after more than ten years."
This game is amazing and great for friends and family. One of the best games ever!
best recomanded game
I much very liek it
"Amazing game. played this for years, this one is even better, more options and its in hd. I recommend"
Just as good now as it was back then!
"I love this game for more or less than two reasons....more. So it is one of the first games that got me hooked increadibly and till this day I am searching for a master piece such as this. The second one is that the HD basically means overhauled graphics (not really, just a couple of retextures and nothing else with graphics), they have extend the number of people you can play on the server and they extended the game's people number to a max of 500. Which believe me is more than enough..a lot more :D. Final thought, if you played games that are rts or strategy related, you will like this cause it's a masterpiece revived from the past"
"Hey, that's pretty good!"
The best game of my life.
Been in the same battle since buying
After all those years!
"Summary: A great rerelease for a great strategy game. Truly one of my favorites.  This game is a great throwback to my childhood. I fondly remember sending my armies of knights and archers into battle when I was young, and I feel that same sense of joy doing it here. Here are some of the things I liked and disliked:  Good:  -Still the same game: Not much has been changed since I last played, which is great for the most part. I loved the game back in the day, and this is pretty much the same thing. The most notable thing I can see is an update to the AI. It seems much more intelligent and responsive than I remember, and my friends and I had some trouble when we played some games against the harder difficulty levels. -Multiplayer: Easy to figure out, and a lot of fun playing some games with friends who also remember playing as kids. -Graphics: I didn't notice too much of a change, but after looking at some side by side photos I can see the details look a lot sharper.  Bad: -Still the same game: I would have liked to see a bit more added content. This was already a very full game with hours and hours of play time when it was released, but I would have liked to see a bit more with the remaster. This was an opportunity to build off of a great base game, and I would have liked to see more added.  Bottom-Line: I had a super great time reliving the good old days. It's still as great as it was back in the day, which was a whole lot of fun. While I would have liked to see a bit more, I still think it's worth a pickup for anyone who loved it years ago, or anyone who wants to play a straightforward and enjoyable strategy game."
"All the nostalgia, loads of workshop content, depressingly quick AI and more elite longbowmen than my TIME computer could ever handle back in '02"
"My first video game I bought with weeks of allowance... Great memories, and they did a great job modernizing it and making it all pretty while still staying true to the greatness of the game"
  I've always been a big fan of these games and this was no different. I've had the Non-steam version so i was limited to the age of king or conqurers which ever one it is. But my brother bought the steam version for me so we could play it together never beat him but absolutely love these types of game and this series Japenese for the win
"This game was very fun until all of a sudden it wouldn't open at all, I would refund it if I could. Fun but there are some game breaking glitches as in de-syncing and not being able to open it. I have deleted it around 8 times and re-installed it but still it wont open. I have even tryed fixing it with steam help but no progress. If anybody knows how to fix this please tell me."
"IT was working fine, and now the latest update has ♥♥♥♥ed it up! Constantly crashes out part way through games. Pointless and made me stop playing due to this."
Nothing to say here. Great game. Wonderful gameplay. Lovely graphics. Strange AI. Weird tactics. Probably the best thing Microsoft ever distributed to mankind.   If you are too young to know this game - I pity you fools.
  It's slow and gay. 10/10
"Age of Empires II is a classic and is still a lot of fun to play after all these years.  I would pay good money to anyone that would do a PROPER remake of this game for today's computer tech. Don't make it a MMO (Age of Empires Online) and forget the stupid cartoony style.  I also didn't care too much for AoE3, so why mess with a winning concept?  PS:."
"Greatest game I have played. The History, the skill cap and the strategy. Truly a masterpeice."
"What a great game! If you like RTS games based in the Ages, then you'll grow in age pretty quickly playing this. &gt;Fun &gt;You can build a lot of different ♥♥♥♥. &gt;You can kill-off your own team makes. &gt;Great chat-lines with voices. &gt;Still as good as it was about 17 years ago. &gt;And I'm cutting this review short, just so I can go back and play more!"
One archer can't hit anything. One hundred archers can't miss ;)
"Great game, brings back childhood memories but not as gold as AOE Rise Of Rome"
"If there is one Classic Game everyone should have played in his Life, then it must be this.  Playing it offline or online, it offers something unique - it never gets boring. If you like strategical Games, this is the one to start, ... and maybe the second, or the third, or the one you will play forever."
I tried starting it and Malwarebytes' Anti-Randomware blocked it. 10/10.
Just as good as before. Only problem is it has the same issues as before. Still love it though.
Incredible game that's fun to play every now and then. This is one of those games that never gets old.
"I remember watching one of my family members playing this as a child and I was had extreme wounder for it... Sadly during that time it was around 2000 or something like that and I was about 7 years old. Now, thanks to the powers of the beautiful internet and the fantastic devs we now have it for Steam. I might not be very good even against a normal AI but this game is great and I love it. Single-player also? I'll be better at that tbh. This was the first RTS I've seen in a long time that gets me coming back now and then.  Test of time for sure.  ... Dem some op Monks though."
"Do i really need to say,why this games is best!?"
Still one of the best RTS games.
One of if not the best RTS ever made. Now in HD!
A single man can repopulate the whole world Halbedier can kill a castle tree = stone buildings  10/10 would paint wood to stone again
great game
"One of humanity's greatest achievements, now in HD!"
"I saw that game is quite huge. I couldn't do much beginning and to learn all this stuff would take me hours and hours. So, that's why I make it short and leave the game for now with a positive review."
"  Age of Empires II is strategy game. There are various civilization, in normal mode you start with 3 villagers and a town hall. Need gather resources, make an army, upgrades, strategy the battles, fight with team mates, play competitive, build your own map, play campaign.  I lost a good part of my childhood playing this. Of course i Recommend this.  ------------------ Good ------------------ Is realy fun the you play with a lot of friends no bugs (haven't yet found one) hd version competitive mode a lot of content in the workshop   ------------------- Bad ------------------- if you play a long time it gets boring(well at least for me)    "
very nice gameplay ... much fun to play with friends
"Age of Empires 2 is a true classic strategy game, and I have been playing it since it came out! It still packs a punch in terms of storyline and difficulty."
Ah the good ol' days! The HD edition ensures the old game can take advantage of the large monitors of today which is good. Wish they'd create a revamp but the AOE3 attempt was not the same game really and the additions were a distraction.
Yeah it's alright
"AoE II is one of the 'classic' RTS out there... it was a overall medium game until the expansions kicked in. The mechanics are common and understandable, but the games shines through its setting, and mostly through the different civilations in the game... In today standart some of them can not be counted as civilations anymore... they are just garbage... With the first expansion 'The Conquerors' Social Justices Warriors were really happy and excited, because the Mayans and Aztecs where added; the SJW gave the following statment: 'Yeah, finally some game devs stand up for the rights of the native americans and this is really good' But then the developers realized they ♥♥♥♥ed up, because AoE II main market is the surperior european market, and that a expansion with natives will not sell that good there. So they worked with all their manpower 247/ to add the Spanish in the game, before the expansion goes to the stores. They finished this task just in time, so the typical european can replay the history as a superior conquistador to get the gold from the natives... But then the developers got sued... but not by Social Justices Warriors like you expect... they got sued by the  progeny of Francisco Pizarro, the reason why they sued the devs was, that the game features the Aztecs, but not the Inca, so only Hernan Cortes gets his glory in the game and Pizarro is threaten UNFAIR, and this is not ok. So the devs said, ok lets make a another Expansion. So 'The Forgotten' was born and the Incas where added, even the Indians to make the Britsh players happy, so they could enslave the Indians once again. And the slavs in general where added so all slavs like the polish, russians, etc can live in peace together... But adding the Indians was a big mistake, the Spanish and the British were happy... But what a about the portugese? They got really envious and said; 'Devs add us in the game or we will make the same things with you like we did with the average african slave' The devs where so impressed by this statment that they added a new expansion, with the name 'The triangular trade', but the title got ♥♥♥♥ stormed by Social Justice Warriors, so they changed it to 'African Kingdoms', wich means pretty much the same. This Expansions added the Portugese (what a surpirse) and Malians and Ethopians. The portugese were so happy that they added these two african nations, so they send the devs 1millions euros, because now they can take the people from mali and sell them as slaves (ingame). Triangular trade is a 2016 now. History has just become real.  I highly recommed this game, so i rate it with slavery/10."
Best game ever.... after many years i still playing with my friends and after 10 years it get a DLC amazing .....
"Absolutely, this game testified to time"
and there's people in the world who say history is boring. if you think this game is boring then you are not my friend.
Can't continue multiplayer game when one gets dcd...
There isn't very much HD in the game but still a good reboot of the game especially with the new campaigns.
"You can convert a catapult to the christianism, or a building to the islam. Dear GOD!! Its SOOO important that your catapult has the same faith as you."
"+ Technically amazing. This game is a networking example for 'Lockstep synchronization' to game developers. + Coop-able (2 players can control the same base). + Amazing animated sprite art. + History lesson. + Still kicking since 1999.  - Balance issues (spam onagers to win). - Coop feature broken with new patch. - Depends on connection quality a lot. - When setting over 75 max population game turns into unplayable korean crap that depends on 'clicks per minute' instead of skill and strategy. And believe me, almost everybody plays with 200+ population setting these days. This introduces even more balance issues and completely breaks the game design."
Get this ♥♥♥♥.
"One of my all time favorite games, many people slander it for being buggy, and in 12 hours of playtime, I have incountered only one minor texture bug. Gameplay is as classic as the original, improved AI is definitely a welcome change, but the original A.I. is still an option if you preferred it. Includes more map types, tooltips are added for every option in most menus, and has an active modding community. This game deserves so much more attention than it gets, and is vastly superiour to it's successor and matches up with it's predececcor. Multiplayer is simply set up using steam's native servers. HD Resolutions are available for modern graphics cards and many mouse options make the world easier to navigate.  Rating 10/10: Perfect Remaster, has replaced the original CD for me by far."
I remember playing this game as a kid with my old sh*tty computer good times good times
Played this back in the days when I was like 7 years old when it was released. And now it's back with new content! Had no idea what I did back when I was 8 years old more than howdoiturnthison and just removed kebab with it. Today I'm more mature and I'm trying to git gud for the first time. Even though I'm only playing against friends and AI it's still the good old classics that I liked.
Set yourself up for failure and somehow manage to win by a thread
"If you like RTS games, and haven't played this..... STOP READING AND BUY THIS GAME!!!! It is a clasic, and you should play it. Still enjoyable. Even after 20+ years."
'Start the game already!'
"  Childhood favorite game of mine. Highly recommend this game, every match is quick-paced, exciting, and entertaining. Play as your favorite Civilizations too, and don't forget the expansions, they are worth the cost.  And for those just learning how to play online, try unranked matches to get experience. Welcome to the AoE2 community!  9.5/10, would recommend"
  if you do not own this game then you are definately not a true RTS gamer for this is the best RTS game that i know of.
The masterpiece. 'The' RTS.  Ensemble Studio rules.  But expensive - buy only when discounted.
How do you turn this on
"Great game, classic rts. Buy it if you can"
"Doesn't really feel that much different from the original, which doesn't really matter considering how good it was.  Ignoring the original, it's a very good game. Solid gameplay, decent graphics, not many bugs, and the AI at least doesn't feel like it cheats and will still kick your ♥♥♥ on higher difficulties for most casual players. Storyline is somewhat lacking, but that's honestly not why you play this game in the first place."
Great game! I recommend this 100% if you like a good RTS game! improved graphics from the original game! played multiplayer without problems!
"This game is pretty awesome. I played it growing up, and recently tried to install it via disc onto my gaming computer. It wouldn't install because my system is too new for that old of a game, luckily this HD edition has been a life save. Just like the original game, this game has got me hooked! Thank you steam!"
  cool
Back from the days when games were actually good.
Tried all the solutions in the internet and forums to make it stop crashing on start-up. Nothing worked.   It used to run just fine a year ago on the same PC.
What a ♥♥♥♥ing classic. Highly recommended.
"Nostalgia kick from one of the first games I owned years ago. AI seems to have been improved, graphics aren't amazingly better but still nice. Love this game and the mods that can be put in. Pick it up and enjoy hours of running around classic maps and new scenarios from the workshop."
"Hi Steam,  Can you please make this game available for Mac?! I play it on my PC but would totally love to be able to play on my Mac too. Thanks!  "
Great game for all who like a fast paced game that can also be a slow game is you wish. All in all its a great game 
Not enough wood m'lord
Great Game
Good game. Much fun.
"This is the greatest game ever. I've been playing for 17 years now and I'm still not bored. I've played a lot of other games in the interim, and I've taken multi-year breaks from this one, but this is what I always come back to. It just never gets old.  For a long time it was kind of hard to play online multiplayer or even get it working on modern OSes, but with the steam HD re-release it works perfectly and there's a ton of people playing every day. It really says something when a game is still this popular 17 years later.  Play AoE2. You won't regret it."
I had this game when i was 8 years old and im plaing it again at 26 and it is still awesome. The strategy needed is awesome.
"An amazing game from my childhood. Had plenty of fun playing with friends, and pwning them. Only negative i can think of is the insane amount of lag when playing multiplayer. I get 0.5-2 seconds of lag, which is incredibly annoying coming from a lag-free game like Starcraft 2. Can't do much micro in this game due to the lag :( Still an amazing game. I wouldn't get it at full price, i would wait for a discount (i bought it for $5)."
dis is nice game
Turned 'Wololo' into my battle cry.
"it's mother♥♥♥♥ing age of empires 2, what else do you expect?"
My childhood &lt;3
-how do you turn this on -furious the monkey boy -aegis -lumberjack / cheese steak jimmy's / robin hood / rock on - marco / polo - natural wonders - i love the monkey head - to smithereens - black death
good game worth the price and is an easy going game to relaxe after a long days work
Another all time classic. Certainly one of the best RTS games ever made. Strong recommendation to buy the base game.   WARNING: Don't waste money on the 'The Forgotten' DLC. This  should  be forgotten.
"I love this game. However I have to warn that Steam version never worked properly for me :| To sum up, I cannot start games other than campaign - so no multiplayer and no custom games. Support tried to help me, but they eventually gave up. Just like me. EDIT: While support couldn't help, reinstalling system did. Game works fine ^^"
"Used to play this game for hours on end at the age of 14, 12 years later nothing has changed.. one of the Best RTS games of all time, you will find nothing like it."
"Only one word could describe this game, Wololo.."
this game wont even start
"I bought age of empires 2 hd for myself and my son so we could play each other. after a month we both get page script errors on the start up when we try to play the game. it asks us if we want to run script any way i click yes, click play game and nothing happens. There does not seem to be any steam backup i can email to get advise, i bought the games from steam and seem to have no game support, i cant reload the game as it says i already have it and does not allow for a reinstall. Can any one help?? regards kim"
Game will not start. I've asked for help from STEAM but all I hear is crickets. Maybe it's a Window's 8.1 PRO issue. I don't know. At first I kept getting script errors. Now I get the initial start screen but when I hit PLAY I get nothing. Nada. Zilch. And Steam is useless unless you love automated replies.
"piece of ♥♥♥♥ wont ♥♥♥♥ing launch, i want a refund or some support or something"
"Bought this game on sale. Didn't work, crashes whenever I try to start a single game. Tried reinstalling several times both the game itself, steam and windows, verified the game cache, even tried upgrading to windows 10 from 8.1, nothing works and you will not get any help from steam's support page.   Don't buy if you don't want to waste $$$$ n time! Peace."
would not work with windows 10...tried many things to get it working but no luck
Please! Can't you just have a bottom to return to the original AOCII hotkey?
Didn't work for me Sadly
Game does not work. Jipped out of money and got no help from steam about the issue
"for some reason i cant play, i go to standard game and set up small 2v2 deathmatch and it goes to waiting for players and freezes. can you please FIX THIS FOR ME :("
"I guess 'Single Player - Standard Game' means go ♥♥♥♥ my self, which leads to desktop."
"Game refuses to launch. Fully up to date, and i've reinstalled countless times."
"This game won't even work, I have tried everything people online have said to do and keep getting a main.ccp error. I have found literally hundreds of posts from people with this error. Game will not run, fails to start as soon I click play from the launcher. What a rip off. Going to have to be more careful purchasing games from steam."
"game doesnt even work anymore! i wasted 20 dollars on a game that should have been 5. i want my money back, how the hell can you sell me a game that cant even work when i want it to? this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."
"0/10  cant play game, have deleted and reinstalled several times.  will not open the game?????"
"was a great game, now crashes every second game and goes 'installing age of empires' since the update, please fix this else I wont ask others to get this game despite how amazing it is like I have in the past.  I can't host my own scenarios either else the game crashes. This game is currently plagued with bugs and crashes all the time, I doubt the developers will bother to fix this either  further updating this review, after the latest 'fix' the game fails to even start for me"
This is my childhood memory
"This is my second-favorite RTS. And by second-favorite, I mean my favorite besides the masterpiece that is Total Annihilation. All other RTS games can bow to the eternal struggle of Core versus Arm."
"Sick game m8, cured my cancer.  10 russians out of 69 hitlers. - IGN"
"Had over 1,000 hours on this game before steam. When I saw it was on steam I'm like. Holy s***! Instantly bought it. Haven't played it as much as of late but definitely a great game. 10/10 would buy again."
most amaing game ever period
One of the few games still playable 15 years since lauch
"Age of Empires II is an RTS classic. Anybody can still enjoy this game as it aged very well. The 2D sprites are still good and the gameplay is as awesome as you heard. This HD remaster is just what this legendary classic needed. If you like strategy games, this is the one most of us started off with."
"A classic that will never get old, period."
Bretty good 5/5. Just don't be a dunce like me and use the patch and the multiplayer works.
oh the good old days... when strategy games were at peak it was a wonderful time for gaming. no exceptions if you like strategy games buy this. jsut do it
"So, you have come to hear the tale of Frederick Barbarossa? This game teaches many things about medieval history, it's a legendary RTS with nice multiplayer community and you can go about some good ol' kebab removing templar style!"
This game deserves a classic RTS game award. I played this game long time ago when I was in the diaper.
"With all the add-ons and quality of life improvements, this game surely stands the test of time as one of the defining strategy classics."
"Age of Empires 2 is an extremely fun RTS game. In it you can build you Empire from a building and a few units to an immense kingdom stretching from one end of the map to the other. The game is quite simple to learn, and I've always enjoyed playing it. I highly recomend it to any who enjoy RTS games."
Still one of the best strategy games ever made
"I first played this game when I was 6. I'm 23 now, and still love it.  Fun to play, even if you suck at it with your friends or against the AI. Or if you want a challenge, playing online against other people is good for that too. There really is something for everyone in this game and I have never met anyone who has not liked playing it."
Not sure why HD but good
Great game I used to play loads when I was on my windows 95 pc. Still stands the test of time and is great to play single/multiplayer and the lobbies are populated
Still playing and enjoying this game for more than 10 years. It might have some flows but deserves a special place in my heart.
made 2 towers fight eachother 10/10
"Why play against other players when you and your friends can't beat the bots on moderate difficulty. Great strategy game that is perfect in every way. Buy it, play with friends, break your keyboard in frustration as the base you spent one hour building gets annihilated in 5 minutes."
Just as good as it was when the game first came out. Pure 10/10. Classic.
"EDIT: Changing this review to positive because over the years there have been loads of updates and DLC content for this game and I'm really digging it. Lots of effort gone into making the framerate higher too, which was one of my mine gripes back when I first wrote this review.  ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW  This game does not warrant the original price tag of £15 ($20). Simply because there isn't enough content to match it, the original AoE II (with TC) price is now £6.90 ($8.53) Support for higher resolutions, a couple texture changes and workshop support isn't worth £8.10  I would also like the mention the required specs. The original AoE II recommended specs are as follows: 32MB RAM 166MHz CPU 550MB HDD VIdeo Card with 2MB of Memory  The 'HD' Edition raises these considerably with little changes to the game: 1.2GHz CPU 1GB RAM 2GB HDD  Not only that, there is NOTICEABLE FRAMERATE ISSUES when playing the game, and my specs are way above the requirements: 4GB RAM 3.6GHz CPU 768MB 7540D (A6 - 5400K APU)  The original game did not have this problem. I would NOT recommend buying this game. The only time where I WILL is that when the game goes on offer, I bought this and The Forgotten expansion for around £6. But you still get the bad framerate. There's a reason why this got a 68 compared to the 92 for the original on metacritic.  Aside from that, it's regular good old AoE II with support for Aero (WIndows 7, Vista colour issue) and higher resolutions."
"It's official. The winner if Pantheon!!  I'm so happy.  As for the loser...well it was nice knowing you.  Wait can't we work something out?  Nope. CHOMP  And that is all for today. See you next time people who aren't me, Draven. Good night.  later in Tahm Kench's Stomach  LET ME OUT!!! Sigh This is not how I expected I die.  Do you want to live?  Who there?  Do you want power?  Of course I want power. Who is talking?  If you follow my orders, if you do what I say....  You're....it can't be.  I can free you and give you power.  Not like I have a whole lot of options here. Very well I accept.  And so it begins.  lightdragoon88 - about an hour ago"
I've been playing this game for 8 years and i still have a blast with it. Despite the fact that it hasn't been updated in about a year until now. highy recommend it. 9/10
nostalgia...   games were more fun when i was young...  work hard everyday to bring meal on the table and to cover rent for home makes me less focused on games thesedays...  now i understand why people commit suicide
Classic game! Friggin love this game will play with ANYONE WHO CHALLENGES MEEEEEE
A good rage-quitter when playing with friends through LAN
solid game fun to play when wanting to kys
""
A game from my teen years that keeps on bringing back good memories.
"My first game on PC. Very, very nice"
The best game I've played. Never gets old. Never gets boring. Always enjoyable. 100% worth the 20€ if you take the time to learn the basics. (It doesnt take long at all!)
It was k?
Long hours of play for each mission might be a bit stressful at times
"Age of Empires II really is a classic. Even afte playing the more modern versions (Age of Mythology, Age of Empires III) and other similar games (Rise of Nations, The Settlers) I still enjoy this game. I think it is it's simplicity which makes it such a joy to play. I also really like all of the different cultures which have their own unique units and building styles."
You can build settlements! Wololo/10
I wololo'd the ♥♥♥♥ outta enemies. 11/10
amazingly fun game. However not enough ressources on maps. You have just enough to build one entire army and then it's over.
Not until all the damn bugs this game came with since the release of African kingdoms. Then I'll recommend this game.
My favorite game of all time. Grown up with it and now playing it in HD is even more awesome! 10/10 would recomment to everyone!
Spent hours as a kid conquering the world and now will be fighting more civizilitons for the rest of my life. Only wish they were still makimg games like this.
"I don't really know what to say that people will find helpful and help them make an informred decision. All I can put down is my personal list of pro's and cons.  PROS:  - Making this fantastic game work for modern day cmputers is a great gift - A game for all types of players - war mongerers, trade cities, resource gatherers or all of the above and more. - Beautiful, even to this day - A wonderfully simple/complex game. You can learn everything you need to know in an hour, understand all your controls, and yet spend a year mastering it all. - A seamless multiplayer is introduced. No more dialling up your friend's phoneline with an I.P that may or may not change midgame. - Real life stories that meant something to our planet. A great history lesson for those who hate learning. I learned so much about history without meaning to, and I'm better for it.  CONS  - Multiplayer is perfected. This may seem like a great thing, except for the fact that RTS players are scum. A vile, cruel and pointless community of children and teenagers has attached itself to this game. Simply be aware when going online; no one will listen to your opinion; they WILL think they're better; those types on your team WILL lose the game for you; they WILL call you names: they WILL self destruct to stop you getting the win when it turns out they were wrong ... again."
Perfection.
"I think i will always come back to this game, its amazing :) 10/10"
"HD or not, this game is a classic and needs to be played by any RTS fan, arguably one of the originals."
One of the best games I have ever played
"Loved this game as a child, still love it know.  One of the best Strategy games I have ever played"
Have played this game fr years and it somehow never get old :)
This Game will forever stand the test of time. Truly the one of the best RTS games and my fav.
  Old But Gold! :D
"An old classic, which doesn't make it any less of a great game. You can choose from a wide range of civilizations, whether you want to play as the Huns or the Scottish, you can make it happen. Multiplayer and Steam Workshop are also available, and the Scenario Editor is a lot of fun to use and share your creations with others to play on."
Best RTS ever :) So many hours was spent on this game and still is being spent :D  10/10
this game is god like played it in my childhood and still love to this day
Old but gold :)
Pretty Good
"Can't recommend this game enough, a truely timeless game. I lost countless hours to this game in my younger years and still come back for more. A must have for any strategy lover!"
"This is a great game, and alot of fun to play with friends and family."
Great way to spend time in a challenging real time strategy.
"This game is a hit of a generation, and still is unbeatable against modern RTS games. A perfect balance of micro-managing, city building, army, and strategy will surely bring you and your friends hours of fun."
A classic in the RTS genre that shines even today. A milestone of the genre and a must buy to anyone who likes strategy games
Amazing game! Too bad I beat my friends everytime becus they have only just bought the game... When i play online i either have lagg or i suck and get f*cked by the other players
Very good HD version. runs Stable a Win7 and looks good.
"This piece of art reminds me of the good old days playing the original Age of Empires 2 on my old computer. They added new campaigns, new civilizations and fixed most bugs, even though there are still a few left (especially performance issues from time to time) - but it doesn't affect you in any way. 10/10 would buy again."
"Storytime gather round kids around the time i was 5 or 6 i had started playing age of mythology at a friends house. I begged my parents for over a year to buy me the game, and once I got it i played it for years. Sometime last year I saw Age of Empires 2 on sale. I had known this was made by the same devolpers and so I had bought it. I could not stop playing this game for months. Age of Empires is an amazing strategy game, and it deserves all the praise in the world. The game is incredibly hard to play as you need to use a lot of strategy inorder to win the random scenenarios. The game also has a campaign that follows many of the crusaders, conquers and warlords as they conquer, pillage, and force their faith."
Shelby Cobra Conquers The World
The greatest game of all time
"I love this game, it takes me back to my childhood as its one of the first games I ever played on the PS2"
great  if you are not great at strategy ally then wall yourself in and build a huge army position them then attack works every time
"AOE was one of my all time favorite games when I was young. Its fantastic to see it on steam! Game works great, no problems on my end! =D"
I played this game when it first came out however my disk broke and I haven't been able to play it since. When I saw this I was delighted and when I played it i realised the only changes that had been made were very good ones. This is an incredible game.
awesome way better than the first and the second i love the main character stories you chose from. i would give this a 4 out of 5. game can get rediculously hard tho.
It is good.
ever since my first computer i got at the age of 3 i played this when it was introduced to me. Now that i am able to play it again brings a lot of memories back. El Cid!
"A classic game with a great update, check out some of the new skins for units."
"Was a great game until the Mongols decided to attack. Jk, anyways I recommend getting this game whenever you have spare funds, a great time killer, along with varying gameplay every single multiplayer game you play. Single player is great for them easy achievements(recommend on lowest difficulty if you're achievement hunting.) Custom scenarios on multiplayer add more depth from the competetive side of things, and are for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, no salt pl0x. Overall, 11/10 would play again..was tempted to say 'It was alright.'"
"I remember getting the game for my windows xp and playing the game for +700 hours in the game, now i still have the case of the origional game but now the cd so i was super happy they put AOE2 on steam, i bought it the day it came out on steam for me and my brother to play together like we used to do. 20/10 GREAT GAME!"
"yes, but never take me to the first time when i played the original version of this game."
Solid and intuitive RTS that should be the first port of call for beginners to the genre. Just remember: you can never have too many villagers early game.
"Strats of the world, conquest or search and destroy ¨*"
It's an iconic game that everyone should at least have the chance to play
"AoE2 is an excellent RTS that still holds up years after release asking for a strong mix of strategic resource management, in-battle tactical decision making, and quick reactions from the player. Even years after its initial release, this game has a huge amount of depth, while still retaining an intuitive surface level that does not leave new/casual players feeling lost. The HD addition still has some networking problem, but the DLCs fix a lot of the bugs and UI issues from the games original release and add a number of interesting civilizations into the mix. Overall, an amazing game and a staple for any RTS fans."
"Timeless classic. They've done a fantastic job bringing Age of Empires 2 into the current era. It was enough of a graphics and engine haul to deserve a remake, runs smoothly and the additonal extra's through DLC and game content have been a welcomed edition.  If you loved the original, then this is a must have."
Timeless classic
"One of my favorite RTS games. Actually, the only RTS game I play. Played this since I was a kid, easily clocked in 200x the amount of time I've played on steam, still having fun with it.   Also, the soundtrack is amazing."
Such a classic game that you really cant go wrong with if you love history or RTS.
"What's there to say? Classic AoEII, instant time-travel to a part of your life where you were happy."
"This game will never stop entertaining me. Quick warning though: if you just play 1 game, it can all of a sudden be 3am."
It's Age of Empires. The multiplayer matchmaking works like a game is expected to in this generation.
This is probably one of my favourite games still. Reminds me so much of my childhood!
"Long Story short: If you've played before, and you're a fan, I totally recommend you buying this. You'll keep track of achievments, hours of play, and even a global multiplayer ranking. But if you never played before, I suggest trying it out first. --- This game should not be costing more than 20 bucks, really. As a new game AOE would be a must buy. But it's stale and old. Sure, there are lots of patchs to make it work on newer hardwares, and sure, the price is quite fair for an old game that's been reused maybe too much. People who've played this game since their childhood will find this steam option a great choice. But if you're not into nostalgia and little remaster work, you should not buy this. --- "
"Age of Empires is a lot like Bret 'Hit Man' Hart:   The Best There Is,  The Best There Was,  The Best There Ever Will Be  11/10"
how do you turn this on
Still has the same replay value years later.
"Something about this game always brings me back. I played it as a kid and loved it, I play it as an adult and love it."
"Age of Empires remade to work on all modern machines, with few new features. Nothing extraordinary, but you simply can't go wrong with this one."
relly good game i have playd it since i was saml!. then i saw that there was a HD version and i knew that i neded to get it and i relly love that its esy to play online ore withe friends. relly recomend it if you are in to stategy games;)
"I love this game. When it came out on Steam in HD, I literally said 'Shut up and take my money' and you should too."
Must buy to remember the good old days. Fit with resolution of new screen
"What could I expect. You get old, but old games will always take you back to childhood. HD is all I could ask from a remasterization, throwing mods made by the community updating old ones.   I mean, it's still funny as heck. Where else would you see buildings catching fire with swords. Or rams converted to christianity.  WOLOLOLOLO"
"Fantastic game, got this in the steam summer sale because I remembered playing with my cousin on the original game ages ago. Needles to say I completely sucked but I'm still really enjoying the campaign and I think this game has held up really well over almost 17 years "
Theres cheats 10/10
classic rts
loved it as a kid love it now
"When the AoE2 demo was released I played it every night on MSN Zone.  It’s awesome that AoE2 HD exists but it’s in dire need of TLC  No matchmaking Crashes &amp; desyncs  A lot of high skill players use 3rd party software to find opponents so it can seem as though there’s not many people online if you don’t use that software.  Even with it's faults, all these years later it's still an amazing game.   Hopefully we get another AoE game someday.  8/10"
been playing this game since it first came out in the 1990s and I still love it!
"Fun alone, amazing with friends ^^"
Blast from the past
Nice done to this game with new update
"(This is an old review, written again. The old review was very messy and based on my emotions towards a certain aspect that I will mention in here as well.)  Age of Empires 2 is a game I had loved AND it was one of the first more mature games that I have ever played on PC. Back then I was alot younger and mainly played games for... well... kids. I mean, I was like nine years old when I first played it and that mainly due to my father. But what I got is what I loved from that moment on. And in fact it changed my gaming future as it now became one of my favorite genres in gaming. I just loved how much you had to think about what you had to do and how you manage your own people and troops.  But of course, as time went on the games I played varied and AoE was forgotten. Until one day, years later, I found that old disc and shoved into the, now new, PC. Safe to say that it didnt live up to standards. Simply because Windows 7 and old AoE just dont really fit together anymore. At some point the game just broke on me and I couldnt play it anymore. I was sad until i found out about the HD remake of AoE2 on Steam. I instantly bought it and kinda did the same as before. I hopped into a sologame. Aaaaaaand I got rekt by the PC cause it was the highest difficulty.  But now I was looking for something new. When I first played the game I did everything. Played solo, the campaigns, made my own campaigns and all the good stuff. But, I never played online. And since I didnt really wanted to repeat it all, I thought: 'Lets have some fun online!' And, well, so I went online and had a good time! Or at least that is what I would if it would be true.  You know, I understand how a game (especially when its played online) can turn competetive. I myself want to win the game as well. Nothing bad about that, right? But when the whole experience turns into competetive garbage, the fun is left behind. The first time I went into the online experience I got about 6 people. We played on four Islands and I was together with someone else on one of them. So we said that we would not fight each other and declared each other as allies. We built our defenses and got some good stuff up. Until, all of the sudden, one of his guys started to attack my people. And soon after that he ran in with his whole entire army to just wreck my stuff. Safe to say that I was kind of surprised. You can win this game with an ally but this guy just went for it.   Being a bit disapointed and angry I started a second game, after that cluster♥♥♥♥ and got about 7 people. This time we played on solid ground with only a few rivers here and there. I I noticed that one of the guys was fairly close so I had to build up my wooden walls. But I soon, not having reached the first age milestone, realised how I was already attacked by a good amount of military units of the guy close to me. And again, I was disapointed. I had lost the game, soon after it started just because I didnt do the same thing he did, which is literally bumrushing the enemy.  And here comes the thing. Upon looking up what is going on, I found out that these are the strategies of the players today. There is no more old school strategy involved with working together or simply hoarding all of it for yourself. No trading, no building up your best stuff to send the army against the army of the other guy. Its simply just 'Kill when he least expects it' or 'Bumrush him so I dont have to fear him later on'. And here is my question for people like this: Where is the fun in that? I mean, I would get it if this would be like CS:GO where you level up and play against other grand players. But this is a game that is as casual as it can get. And to be honest, you are ruining the game for people that have never even played a strategy game.  So, would I recommend AoE2? Yea. I would. But not because of the Multiplayer. If you want to have a good time with an oldschool game and play some solo games, go for it. If you never played multiplayer or dont know any advanced techniques: DONT PLAY IT."
Love it
"EDIT: The game, in its current state, is extremely buggy due to recent updates. If you're buying the game for the new content, you're better off waiting. If you don't care much for the new updates, you can downgrade the game to an older version that works. Right now the game (especially multiplayer) is broken.  Nevertheless, this game is definitely one of my favourite multiplayer games."

Amazing game brought me back to my childhood. It you love strategy games this is for you 10/10.
"If you liked the game back in the day. Here it is for steam and with multiplayer, albeit a bit laggy."
Classic. Shame I'm ♥♥♥♥ at it.
*Nostalgia Intensifies* I just love this game!!!  Everything from the gameplay to the graphics that are nice (for it's time).  Would give it a 9 Outta 10
Wololo
"I'm glad that Microsoft let this happen. As a kid in the late 90's and early 00's, this was my go to game. Now its back, and bigger and better than ever. AoE II is a must for any RTS player."
I dont like strategy games but ik kan play this eny day And enjoy it 5.9/10
"Really good game, I played a lot when I was a child, and after a long time I played it again and still good."
"This game has a very simple concept, build through the ages to make the greatest empire. But to keep your empire you have to fight with armies chosen by outthinking your opponent. Not every army is build the same way, you have to think to outplay your opponent. Never make a one sided army which can be crushed by different one sided army. Mix your armies and outthink your opponent. Also never forget your economy, without resources you won’t make it far. This game is mix between resource management and making clever use of the units you have to your disposal."
"This game is still my favourite after all these years. Yes it will cause you anger and it will make you stay awake late at night, just to finish one mission!"
Amazing time-consuming game!
I was a king in my childhood.
"I so happy when this went on Steam as i had been playing the games on their orginal disk, but with operating systems coming out every year I know ill have this game for many more years"
"As great as I remember , note that if you have problems with sync and lag download the open beta 4.8 it will fix it"
Simple the best RTS game still around.
This game deserves the “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.
"I love this game. Played this so much as a kid, brings back some memories."
Age of Empires II was my favorite game at launch and still going strong!
"This is an excellent game that still holds up as a solid, engaging and at times, utterly relaxing experience, 17 years after its initial release. It is an excellent choice for anyone wanting an introduction to the RTS genre, or looking for a change of pace coming from an overlapping genre."
"I remember old times, but I don't like the new icons for resources"
Still playing it 17 years later.
Still A great game after all these years.
"This was my first RTS a long, LONG time ago. So many good memories, including a game that started with 8 people, lasted 3 days (effective playtime was more like 30 hours), of which the last 8 hours was just a friend against me which I won only because I spotted his navy by sheer luck while it was in the move. Also, history tests were a breeze having learned quite a bit from reading the info and playing the campaigns. If I ever reproduce I'll make sure my spawnlings play this game until they can beat me."
Best Use of a Farm Animal 2016  Sheep are the best source of early game food.
no need another RTS
Barely functions
"No lan support, games get desynced, the beginning of the game is really laggy which messes with your build order.  Is no good."
cool
"A classic is always a classic. It's a shame the resolution isn't changeble in the settings... (The old one, although with only 3 possible resolutions, they could be configured. Not in this one, especially bad for people with 2.5k or 4K monitors)"
Mildly Adequate.  10/10
"Really good strategy game, it is somewhat easy to pick up, but challenging to master. Good job."
Currently playing EU rules. No attacking. Freedom of movement. Heavy trading.  Until someone leaves and it errupts into all out war. 10/10.
A good nostalgia trip if you ask me. buy buy buy
It's Age of Empires II in HD.  Do i need to say anything more?
A worthy contender of the Nato Timeless Classic Award. If you haven't yet please vote for this as the Nato Timeless Classic Award. Thanks guys :)   Oh btw this game goes down alright.
.
It's the best RTS game I've played.
This is a great classic game that is even better with the Steam Workshop support. It truly stands the test of time!
"I have played a lot of strategy games, and I am not sure what it is about AOEII that keeps me playing it over others, but I do."
10/10 will raid enemy with sheeps again
"This game just never gets old, I remember first playing it when I was 4!"
"Worth money, great classic."
"I enjoyed this game on a number of levels. You have the fog of war to clear and scout units with which to do so. I like the bit of mystery at the beginning and the feeling of accomplishment I get when I've cleared the map. There's also different types of water navigation units that serve the purposes of gathering resources, transporting ground units, and fighting battles. And you can expand your territories by starting new towns in other areas.  I like games that encourage player creativity, allowing for a unique experience every time. That, more than anything else, will bring me back to Age of Empires over and over again."
Awesome. a must have!
Old but gold!
What a throwback! The graphics and AI have been updated to deliver a game that's just as challenging and fun as it used to be.
Good HD version of an old game.
"I used to play this game at LAN parties, and I still feel that the gameplay lends itself more towards the casual, over-the-table style of play than ultra-competitive build memorisation. Sure you can mess about with the scenario editor and create your own custom battles, but multiplayer is the way to go. If you get this game, make sure that you have someone to play it with, otherwise it's a tough sell compared to other RTS."
"Great game, tons of fun. Online gameplay is easy and smooth, takes a while to learn the game well, but it is totaly worth it."
"Hadn't played this game in years (as in, back in the days when it was only available via CDs), but what fun to relive the classic strategy game of legend and explore all the new enhancements! Definitely will be in my top games for all-time. If you haven't had yet the chance to experience this exceptionally thoughtful, historically-based RTS game that was the catalyst for today's online multiplayer behemoths...what are you waiting for? Game on!"
"Poured countless hours into multiplayer games post Afrikan Kingdoms, only to be desynced from the game every time with all progress lost (because restoring the savegame does not work.) Happens with nearly every single multiplayer session I've been in, we'll be a good hour or two in when it happens, so it's a major waste of my time.   If you want to play this game because of the multiplayer aspect, turn around right now and wait until they patch this game breaking scatfest of multiplayer bugs that were brought with their latest DLC, the Afrikan Kingdoms."
"I prefer age of empires 3 for an easier introduction for newer players, but 2 has abit more variety"
"I recommend this game to everyone who played this game back in 1999. Even if you played it never before, just give this new version a try!  The graphics are polished, its optimized to run on modern systems. Devs constantly bring updates (ca. once every six months).  Playing this with friends just immediately brings me back to the time when we had awesome LAN Parties all year.  The mod support is awesome, you can have new maps, scenarios, skins, etc..... I recommend you download ozharas skinpack from the workshop it makes the game look even better!  10/10"
WARNING*** YOU CAN GET TOOOO ADICTED
"The best RTS hands down. A classic that will never die, no matter how many years go by. This game is why I got into gaming froma young age. So much nostalgia and is still fun to play even today. No RTS title in my opinion has been able to surpass AOE. 10/10 wololooo"
"If I could give a neutral review if possible, but not reccomending the game would be too harsh as this game is incredible ONCE YOU GET IT WORKING. I spent hours last night modifying games file sto get this to work on my machine. Not very good for people who are not well aquainted with stuff like that.   However, provided that your game runs fine on your machine, this game is great."
Amazing with lots of updates
The good old Age!! So many memories!! Thanks for the HD version!!
Played this when I was a child and seeing this 'fan girl scream' becuase it`s back with an improved water visual and a few other minor improvements and it has a new two expansion pack WHAT! seriously its a great game.
"Why are the Celts fighting the Mongolians in Texas? Why does a Teutonic Knight have more health than a house? Why can a monk change the political beliefs of an elephant, a seige catapult and a ♥♥♥♥ing sawmill? It doesn't matter. Few games allow such a scale of war crimes to be committed against your friends, and fewer still capture the actual horror of having your peaceful farming village ransacked by a regiment of Viking Beserkers revealing themselves out of nowhere. One of the best games ever created and more than worth the price. (Its like 2 bucks oin ♥♥♥) (Sorry Steam)."
Classic. Love it. Don't forget to save every 5 minutes. -_-
  Basically the same background story as any other review for this game
"I'm so glad I don't need to look at pixels anymore from the disc I bought 10 years ago :') If you love setting up a village (food, stone, wood,..) If you love getting you're army ready and upgrading it, with a lot of variety.. This is your game!"
"The best real-time strategy game of it's time and one of the best to this date, AoE2 HD brings enhanced visuals and content to this installment of the series, including all expansions, new content and a revived multiplayer system. This game has more content and gameplay options than the sequel, Age of Empires 3, but has dated graphics and a bit worse AI. This game is historically accurate, riddled with customization, has mod support and an unforgettable soundtrack. If you like RTS games, this game will not disappoint you."
This game is good.  I Was create new scenarios I will share in steamworkshop
i bought the game package with the dlc on sale. best childhood game
"A classic RTS.  The HD remaster allows up to 500 unit cap.  New, better AI.  More civilizations to choose from.  Runs smooth and flawlessly on my machine. No more fiddling with compatibility modes."
  Would wololo again. 5/7
This is not only 'The Strategy Game'. Here you learn History and enjoy an awesome adventure!! WOLOLOLOLO!!
My favorite RTS growing up. Bring back the nostalgia!
"This is probably the only game I've put more hours into than Star Wars Battlefront 1-2, and Morrowind when I was younger. So glad they made a version that works on newer Windows operating systems."
"The best RTS is back better than ever, fully support to new generation, with Full HD ( I Play in 2K ), re-texture better looking, steam community mods, and a online system fully working."
one of the best rts games of all time definitely worth checking out!
"Age of Empires II HD, remastered a few things and charged again to play this old game. But I think in a way is worthed, It's not playable on Steam, which makes online games way way way easier than back in the day. And in general the game it's still intact. One of those strategy Games which are so fun to play even years later."
AOE 1 was my first strategy game. I played AOE II since it first came out. This is a classic RTS. I highly recommend it to everyone.
Good game if you played as a kid and again now + super to play long battle's
"Never gets old, great multiplayer and new content keeps comming"
excellent version of a game ive always loved. well worth a play. 30min to 1hour single player or play for hours on campaign.
Game patch has screwed things up
I still have nightmares of armies of priests coming for me.......
One of the first games i ever played and its still good
Too easy playing against Ai but otherwise a good game.
  All of my yes. All of it.
"It was nice coming to this game after 5 years, still wrecking ♥♥♥!And the new default hotkeys where actually a good surprise and make more sense than the old ones, definetely recommended.But beware this game is about strong decision making, fast thinking, micromanagement(especially since there is a lot of latency on multiplayer games because you are playing with people all around the world) and a lot of practice!New players dont be discouraged watch some youtube videos, read some guides and you will become a good player soon!"
"Talk about nostalgia! I used to play this game forever when I was a kid, and it totally brings back the vibe of the good ol' days. It's honestly what it's advertised to be, it's a working version of the old game. I do wish they could perhaps re-done the main menu to make it look a bit more modern or better, other then that it's like stepping into a time machine."
"I really enjoy this game, I've been playing it since the 90s and it never gets old."
"AOE II and III, one can not exist without the other, classic"
"This game is my first history educated book while I was a kid. One thing players should figure out is that the AI sometime looks stupid, it's hard to improve your skill by playing with AI all the time."
Switched to Linux Mint with Steam but I miss this game a lot since :(
Just as great as it used to be! I only wich I could play a friend over Lan instead of just beeing able to play via the internet
"  This game has reminded me of my youth. according to my opinion about this game;  pros:  the graphics are better than the old version   some new storylines   can play online between countries   supports Steam Workshop   cons: it's not free ( ofcourse, u must buy it )  I recommend you to buy this game."
F***ing rushers!
A classic in the RTS genre that shines even today. A milestone of the genre and a must buy to anyone who likes strategy games
Amazing game! Too bad I beat my friends everytime becus they have only just bought the game... When i play online i either have lagg or i suck and get f*cked by the other players
It's a meme.
Coolest stuff ever.
Best game of all time. It has withstood the test of time and is still the best game ever.
"Classic Game. Play it as a kid and loved it Play it now, still love it! "
Bretty good 5/5. Just don't be a dunce like me and use the patch and the multiplayer works.
One of the few games still playable 15 years since lauch
"Age of Empires II is an RTS classic. Anybody can still enjoy this game as it aged very well. The 2D sprites are still good and the gameplay is as awesome as you heard. This HD remaster is just what this legendary classic needed. If you like strategy games, this is the one most of us started off with."
"Already played it on Disc a lot of years ago, and now its even better (Easy online game setup)"
"Age of Empires II was probably one of the first games I ever played and left with me such a lasting impact that i still remember it 16 years on. It's, to this day, one of my favourite real time strategy games with an emphasis on resource and troop management. However, when I tried to play it recently I found it wouldn't run from my old disk so you can imagine my joy when I found this remastered version on steam. The game has everything i know and remember from the originals with all the DLC packs and even some new ones made for this HD up[date ( which i might add doesn't feel truly HD but i can appreciate that it's definitely a heck of a lot prettier than the original). Overall if you're looking for a fun real time strategy game you can't get much better than this!"
"Personally, this is one of the best games I have ever played. Definetly recommend getting this game especially if it is on sale. The workshop and community also give this game a new light with custom mods and texture packs. Playing multiplayer is easy and when I play with friends, the game is always fun."
Best RTS for the decade
"Probably the best RTS ever made! I've spent nearly a hundred hours in this game on Steam as well as many more when the non-HD game came out many years ago. The game has intuitive controls, decent AI, great 2d graphics and great sound,"
Greatest RTS ever! the olny game to ever past the the test of time. was the best RTS back in the days and even to day IT is STILL the best RTS.This game will last more then a life time
It's AoE 2... what more can you say??
Best strategy game of all time!
"Good HD edition, but still has room for improvment."
Have played this game fr years and it somehow never get old :)
"This is one of the first games I remember playing. It was back on my Windows 98 PC. The game is still, even today, a great game, that will never get too old. I've even bought the game 3 times. I highly recommend you to try it, if you haven't already."
I can't think of any game more deserving of the 'test of time' award
"HD or not, this game is a classic and needs to be played by any RTS fan, arguably one of the originals."
Just play this mother♥♥♥♥ing game already. If you haven't youre about 17 years late to the party.
"Been playing this since 2003, not stopped yet.  The HD is an icing on the cake"
One of the best games I have ever played
This Game will forever stand the test of time. Truly the one of the best RTS games and my fav.
I like this game because it had arrows and they are my favorite type of row. Also it had swords which are pointy and I am made of nothing but pointy things so i felt it was a tribute to my pointiness. In conclusion this game is great and all american school children should play it as part of their normal curriculum.
One of the best RTS of all time
"Ive had this game for a long time. I played this when I was a kid. Im not the best player or even one of them though.  This game will always be one of those games that I can come back to and enjoy. Especially with friends.  Its a must have. It isnt perfect, but its amazing."
"Although the graphics and engine are dated, it still has a lot of depth and complexity in terms of unit choice and economic management. Has quite a few preformance issues, but the latest patch (4.8) has resolved some of them."
The benchmark of the RTS genre.
"I was playing this on a Gateway running ME... oh gawd, what dark days those were. But, titles like this and Operation Flashpoint (now ARMA) made for lasting gaming memories. It's certainly not the shiniest game out there, but the new content and nostalgia were far more than enough to get me to drop for it (on sale, of course). Someone unfamiliar with the series might not find it as entertaining and enjoyable to play through, but I'd still recommend it to anyone with the $5 necessary during a sale.   On something of a side note, I don't recall the original having the issues that I experience with unit pathfinding, though I could be misremembering."
The game where you can explore the map with one sheep only. Isn't is the best use of a farm animal? :)
"Great game.  Was good back in 1999, and is still great in 2016. Is a perfect example of good games made to last.  10/10 would play again in 2030"
"This is one of the best RTS games of all time inmy opinion, I don't get as much time to play it now, however I enjoyed playing it very much when it was first released and it still plays well today.  Many older games can often be quite difficult to pick up I find, especially newer strategy games. With AoE the gameplay mechanics are well refined though, meaning that the game is pretty easy to pick up and play for a newcomer especially if there is some RTS experience. You have to balance four resources; stone, wood, gold and food. To get these is pretty simple, although there is strategy involved as you have to build villagers and decide which resource to gather. Do you go for wood, or do you place more emphasis on food? You also need to consider how many villagers to build, and if you are building more you may need to raise the population cap with more houses. Getting your resource management right is a big part of the game, however it becomes easier the more you play.  As for the gameplay mechanics, they pretty much stand the test of time. Simply drag and select your units and click them on an enemy/building to attack. You also can set formations for your units if you feel the need. As well as this you have hotkeys which you can use to circumvent the menus when building. Generally speaking the controls are very well refined and definitely stand the test of time. Another thing worth mentioning is in the bottom right is your minimap, next to it is a 'find villager' button which locates any idle villagers. This is a huge help in-game.  The HD version doesn't really feel much different from the original, the resolution is updated however this version is basically just the original updated for 2013. It's also great to see the game is still being updated with expansions, especially now given the demise of the Age of Empires series. "
I want that badge
Good old Age of Empires II like the original with Steam integration.
"Just like the old AoE2 this game is worth the price if you are up for this kind of games. The only problem I encountered with it was that the multiplayer servers weren't really the best ones.... A lot of games either me or someone I played with had lags. Even if we played in LAN (just 2 of us vs Comp) one or both had lags. Nowadays its solved more or less, but still it happens from tie to time.  Giving it a 8/10"
I still remember the first time I played this game. It was on my mom's pc with only 500mb RAM. Laggy but I loved it!
Still going strong 17 years and counting
I cannot believe that was able to play it with friends and with almost no lag and drops at all as the old version had so issues in this aspect. It is good to see a cult classic again and working flawlessly on a modern PC.
Still as good as the first day I played it 13 years ago.
"one of the all time classics, brings back a lot of good memories :D  hope we get to see new civs added with time, keep up the good work on this one devs!"
"This game will live through a millenia heh, best RTS :D"
"Quality timeless game, have been playing ever since it first came out!"
Been playing this game for over a decade. Still enjoyable and fun to kill a few hours on.
"The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.  The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.  The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.  With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.  In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]  In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, 'The Star-Spangled Banner') and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a 'second war of independence' against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an 'Era of Good Feelings' in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.  In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe."
"Really fun game that test how good you can lead a army and build the best city and defense in the game. With a Steam WorkShop, map editor, and texture packs its pretty amazing."
"This game was well made then, and it is a well made HD remake now. It is still fun and my childhood memories came flooding back loading it up. A fun game and if you aren't a RTS fan, you are missing out!"
"Was a lot of fun while I played it. I've not played it since discovering Banished. It was through this game, however, that I found I was more interested in city building than building armies. I'd get frustrated that the workers would cut down the trees that I built houses around and how my houses started looking cluttered the more I expanded to win the game. That's pretty much what told me that I was more interested in decor than actual fighting. The unique armies were great, the way each empire had its own specialty and building style is still appealing."
Best RTS ever have played it since i was 4
"Anyone who plays this game can already tell you how fantastic this time killer is. When I say 'time killer', I PROMISE that you will sit down and play this game over and over and over again. So go ahead and do yourself a favor; call into work for the next week, purchase all explansions and the base game, and kick out your girl for the week. A good way to save money too. (you'll play so much that you won't have time to spend money)"
"I ♥♥♥♥ing love warcraft 3 its great, but i cant see that dope 3d character portait instead its some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2d sprite. Wtf blizzard fix this game."
"This game is great. Here's my reasons.  Gameplay: The basics are very easy to master, from collecting resources at the start, to end-game massive wars that take place somewhere on the map. Once you get the hang of it, advanced techniques that you will pick up later on will help you gain more resources and create a larger more efficient army. Real world war-time strategies do work in this game to a certain extent. The game has a multitude of different nations each with their own specialities and weaknesses. This gives the player a huge amount of space to play, you could be a early-game rusher, or be a late-game fortress.  Graphics: The buildings and troops are easily distinguishable and the game is as great as it is, however if your eyes still burn from the 'horrible' graphics as you say. The steam workshop provides its huge array of textures and in some cases, sound. The textures you can find there will absolutely give your game a facelift, however your computer might suffer from fps drops depending on the mods added."
Good game. 8/10 would play again. Recommended for those who have played the original AoE and for those who like this kind of strategy games as this is one of the best in its genre.
Fantastic update on a classic!
"Of course, it's awesome"
"MONEY SCAM!  i bought HD version of this game for ONLY ONE reason.   And that is - be able to see more map (for gameplay comfort)   (all forum 'help' is useless, change desktop resolution every time you want play game - useless... )   Developers just played with photoshop and replaced old textures with ugly 'HD' ones.  Don't waste money!  -100/10"
"One the best RTS games of all time gets an HD overhaul. A better game engine that provides higher resolutions, more units on screen without lag, higher population limits, Steam multiplayer support, and more.  A must own for any fans of the classic Age of Empires series."
"The best RTS game ever, with the most replay value. Unmatched."
"Many happy childhoods were forged by this game. Great game, Great community."
"It's the same great experience, only now it supports high resolutions without a problem. I was just a kid when it was first released and playing it again brings back many fond memories. The addition of steam workshop is great. New content via DLC helps revive this classic.  Of course there are some problems and the most noteworthy issues are:  1- The same bugs that existed with the original version are carried over to the HD Edition as well. You'd think 15 years are enough to solve evey bug in the game but clearly they didn't even attempt to do so.  2- On my QHD monitor, the UI scaling is very poor and the icons and fonts are sharp but very small. I have tried fiddling with every scaling option in Windows or the GPU drivers and the sacling hasn't improved at all  3- Old saves from the original game can't be loaded because they cause the game to crash.  4- Enabling or disabling Vsync causes the game to crash  5- The game can suddenly crash without a known reason during gameplay. Make sure you save FREQUENTLY."
3 hours roll by pretty quickly.
Really good nostalgia. Can be a little slow after populations start to grow (around 500 mark). But otherwise awesome.
"Come on. It's mother-frickin Age of Empires II! Any guy who grew up with strategy games must've at least played this. A timeless classic which has elements that surprisingly hold up to this day. Sure the isometric view has it's quirks like weird wall and gate placements, but this game is pretty damn fun. Picked it up on sale for cheap so I can't argue value wise. One thing to note is the finicky nature of the game itself. Sometimes it refuses to start while at other times getting online is a chore. But once you get in man oh man. Nostalgia.  And yes. I've played enough of it over the years (and finally on Steam) to have heard all 12 or so of the soundtrack enough to know their tunes. And props to that kickass theme.  And developers you cheeky bunch. Releasing a DLC after ALL THESE YEARS. Major props. Might pick it up soon. Ah well. Hope my farms don't run out again."
"I loved it growing up and the steam reboot is nice, good to play with a few friends!"
It's the classic game back and looking better than ever. Still the same great game I remember. My only wish is that the developers would have tried to optimize the game more to take advantage of modern gaming rigs.
"This game is run smoothly in Windows 10, but i don't know it just me or anyone else. I only got/stuck at 30fps on modern pc, yeah maybe because is old game i don't know  But Overall, this game bring back my childhold.  The HD Version is not just a Remaster Edition, but supporting the newer version of windows (7, 8, 8.1, 10) And is integrated with Steam Workshop, so i don't need to open my browser to search for mods.  I try to play AOE3 before, but there is Flickering Graphics problem (resolved, but Menu freeze problem show up) they need to make a patch to Windows 10.  Age of Empires II HD is A RTS Game by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Games, well this game has known for it's RTS game back there (1999), and it got remastered by Microsoft in 2013, they improve old features like AI Improvement, High Definition Textures, also new features like, Steam Integration (Trading Cards, Workshop, etc.), AND MULTIPLAYER  Even my army cannot move correctly (stuck, glitches through wall, and other glitches)  THIS GAME GOT 10/10 17yo Games RTS Simulator"
"A little slower paced than some RTS games out there, however, the feeling of amassing a civilization from basically nothing is suprisingly addicting!"
This game brings so many good and bad feelings back to my memory.  Definetly worth every penny.
A very cool game that I like to play a lot and lose all the time :C
Just as good ole' times ey'
"Graphics can be fixed easily with workshop texture packs,but the main game is great.it has no DLC requirement and is over all better than 3 "
Excellent game. If there is too much lag play on voobly.
This review is probably not well supported by my hours of gameplay on Steam. Please note that I must have thousands of hours out of steam.  I will keep this review short and simple:  BEST RTS EVER.  That's it.  Buy it.
"  Awesome game with endless possibilities and replayability, would highly recommend to anyone"
AWESOME JOBS GUYS cool to be able one cild hood clasic
Most epic game ever enough said :D
"It's a classic! Great game, very entertaining and very competitive."
Never get bored of this game...
"I've played over 10,000 hours on this game. I've had it sense I was like 5. It's an amazing game. Why have you not bought it yet?"
Great
10/10 would have my friend's town destoyed then have him move into my town so I can have him give me his resources to destroy the english.
I converted a tower to catholicism.  wo/lolo
"I owned Forgotten Empire a while back and played the ♥♥♥♥ out it, after hearing that a new expansion came out and the game was $7(Plus Forgotten Empire and the African Kingdoms expansion), I had to get it. I do not regret my purchace, the is game is a solid 10/10  Oh yeah they also included the voice lines from AoE 2  14 14 14"
"This game has aged incredibly well. The DLC adds a lot to the experience, but you don't miss out for not having it."
Bought this game when it originally came out years ago. Spent tons of hours on that with no regrets. I'll be doing the same on this HD version.  Definitely recommend this!
I LOVE THIS SO FREAKING MUCH
Monopoly is not the only game where friendships die. 10/10 Would get betrayed again by my best friend in an online match.
I remember using that cobra car cheat to attack anyone....good times.
"Favorite game, totally worth it."
"Really fun and enjoyable game. Worth it, especially at the current sale price. Definitely going to keep playing this."
This game is incredible when it comes to devouring your time. What feels like a quick 10 minute session is really an hour. wololo/10
"i dont really know whats up with my game, i try to play against bots and it freezes on my loading screen with waiting for other players only visble...wonder if i have a bug or something"
"Great game - have loved this for over 10 years.   Multiplayer action is good aswell with a range of skilled players to suit all people... Some bugs as to be expected, but the underlying game is still excellent.  wololoooooo"
I would reccomend this game to anyone into this sort of stuff its by far the best age of empires out there i play pretty much ever day recently doesnt get old :) worth the money
"This game was already amazing but the HD totaly made it able to compeet with any modern day game. This hd effect will revolutionize the industry as we know it. As soon as i started playing it felt like ♥♥♥♥ came flying out of my screen. This however might have been hallucinations, since i sprayed toilet air freshener into my mouth thinking it was canned whipped cream."
Love the multiplayer interface as well as the additional DLC that is made available.
"I absolutely love this game. I believe that it is the best installment of these types of games. This has been a favourite game of my family since it came out. I never got fond of AoE III, this is the best yet.  Look at how many hours I have on account, I believe that says it all. Before I had it on Seam, I'm sure I had much more."
  Backstory of my Experince with Age of Empires
A wolf attacks the Village. Better get the forage instead of killing it. 10/10 would harvest forage again
"Until now, I still playing this game, since my childhood. Love this game, really &lt;3 "
"AoE II has been around for a very very long time and is still going strong today. When I think of rts games AoE is the first game to come to mind before any of the others. It has the perfect blend of civilization simulation, tower defense and combat. Its slower pace is easy for people new to the genre and while other rts games get laggy when you enter combat this game runs like butter. I remember the days when I used to play the AoE Gold CD on the family windows XP computer. It was the first rts game I ever played and the only one I will ever return to. Today we have AoE II HD. Its the same game as it was back then but with the ability to be played on hd displays and you get the Steam Workshop for more content then you could ever want. Its a great game. I love it and it will be my favorite rts game probably for the rest of my life. Totally worth buying and you would be a complete dummy not to get it when on sale."
"It's pretty hilarious how broken many parts of this game are. I just steamrolled through the Alaric Campaign (worst pathfinding ever?), and on the last level you can win in minutes as your main enemy does not respond to one of your allies attacks :P. Also managed to get both the 'Random Civilzation' and '10 wins with Britons' achievements, playing as the Goths in the Campaign...and I'm pretty sure a lot of other achievements must therefore be bugged too.   Don't get me wrong, the game is great. That is, the base game. All the developers have done since is made it 'HD' (i.e laggy, the original quality was ok imo), and stolen the Forgotten mod, which used to be free. Yes, there are updates, but these manifest themselves as times in which the community has to respond to the great amount of bugs before the game becomes replayable (the cursor is still screwed up from last patch...).   Worth £14.99? No. If you don't play multi-player and have the old CD from over a decade ago, use that with the FREE forgotten expansion. Otherwise buy this game on sale. About £6 for both forgotten and base seems reasonable to me, not £18.99 for essentially a stolen game.  Oh, and if you want achievements, don't press 'Pause', apparently using it is cheating and will disable achievements. Yes, even if the mission took 3 hours and you used it for a few seconds...  Edit: Went back to it after a few months. Completed first Portugese mission in expansion, got simulataneously the El Dorado completion and AOE Conquerors completion achievement..."
a classic that will never die.
This is the best game
For my childhood memories
"This game is just as good as the original CD version. It is only missing LAN support. If you played this as a kid, do youself a favor and get this game and the expansions. It's lots of fun!"
"Although it was made more than a decade ago, AOE II is still fun to play and easily one of the best games of this generation. Lots of Civs to choose from, each with their own style of gameplay. SIngle player is fun but Multiplayer is probably the best experience I've ever had from a stradegy game."
Srsly fool it's Age 2 HD get it if you are a cool kid
"Was my childhood life, still my life. Buy it if you're looking for a good RTS."
Omg i forgot how good this game was havent played in years brought it last night in the sale = amazing
"This is a beloved strategy game that I grew up on, and now it's even better. With the added expansion, you can never get too much of this game, and every match is different. This game has set, and upholds, the real-time strategy standards and is quite enjoyable.  The best part of this game is the process of making your own powerful civiliztion. You get to design and create your army to be made out of whoever you want according to opponents strength and weaknessess. It really involes alot of stategy once you get the hang of it, and no, it's not that hard to learn the syntax of the game, espeically if your familiar with RTS games."
Best strategy game ever but now on HD !
it's just like age of empires 2 but lags alot not just in multiplayer but also in singleplayer 10/10 
Probably best strategy game ever C:
10/10
Take a trip down memory lane and relive the glory days from when you first learned to conquer lands and defeat foes. This game is an instant classic and a staple of my childhood gaming experience.
"The game itself is very good, and it will remain a classic RTS game for ages to come, but it still suffers from game-breaking performance issues. LudaKRIS map-size is unplayable, playing NA with an EU player is no where near on the same level as other video games, and the 'HD textures' are a massive disappointment. The game frequently crashes, and the netcode has NOT been changed since the 1.03c patch from 2005.   If you don't care about any of these flaws, you'll probably still enjoy the game because at it's core it's fantastic."
"Best strategic game in history with awesome graphical remake. Enjoyable gameplay, civilizations, maps, including much better AI.  ∞/10 purchase"
"The game is as good as ever, and the new campaigns are well done. The convenience of the steam platform for matchmaking is a big selling point."
"One of the best games of all times in my opiniion, but if I think it through I like a lot of games."
"Childhood game, definitely the second best strategy game ever. (After Red Alert 2, it has a speciall place in my heart =D)"
"I have been playing AoE since its original release, oh those many moons ago. The HD reboot and new expansions, have yet to dissapoint my expectations, and in fact have returned this once beloved game to the top of my favorites list.  New AI is solid and a lot more 'Logical' than the original AI and dosent roll over very quickly when you lay waste to their base. New Turbo mode and other options let you customize the games pace in much better ways as well as let you attain victory only in the ways you approve of. (*Cough* Wonder Victories are for slackers *Cough*)  If you enjoyed classic AoE, you should not hesitate to buy this. (Or copies for your friends, and your friends friends)"
"after all these years, still one of my favourite games"
"I'm not actually that impressed. Graphics to me genuinely seem worse than in the first Age of Empires, units are too small and it\'s hard to differentiate between them.  The AI is just bizarre, when playing the Joan d Arc campaign, the enemies seem to completely ignore me strolling around them until I attack them. So on harder missions I just mass produce petards, walk them right up to the enemy walls/towers/gates/castles and explode them and they do nothing to stop me.  I would say the best feature of this game by far is the sound, the music is blissful.  But really it looks like it was made BEFORE the first Age of Empires...  I\'ll play another campaign and see if I like it more."
The ultimate time eater!
"good game just like the orginal, bit expensive i think for an old game that has been done up to HD. Also get a bit jerky when you have a large army but overall its a solid game with lots of hours of gameplay :)"
"It's not a surprise that such an old but complete game as aoe2 is keeping such a huge hype among players. Mainly I have good words about the game and its DLCs!  Though, few negative/annoying matters bother players who want to play in internet multiplayer. Many times I experienced crushes for many reasons (internet connection mainly), and one of the reasons is about Microsoft servers, which I found not capable for the game. The game itself is great, and is getting better and better everytime a DLC is released. Bad feedback for the crushes in internet multiplayer mode."
Simply Love it! :)
Best AoE in my opinion
Best game ive ever played!
"This is one of the first computer games I touched and I immediately fell in love with it. The simple interface is quick to learn and it's got a nice simple objective. The campaign is historically accurate and it's nicely designed. The graphics aren't anything nice, but you can't hope for better with an older game. The AI is really broken and they seem to have never fixed it. Unless you set it to a really buffed difficulty than there's methods of destroying the other side in a matter of literal minutes. Although that's true, the game itself makes up for it with the variety of troops, tech trees, and new buildings. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes an easy-going strategy. If you like a challenging competitive strategy then I highly recommend you steer clear of this cake-walk for try-hards. Great game though, a landmark in strategy scrolling."
One of the best RTS games behind SC2 and WAR3 in my opinion. Classic game!
very nice game
Never try to wololo a wolf.   10/10 would wololo again.
"I am enjoying the game very much. I startet to play the Conqueriors Expansions 10 years ago. Many bugs got fixed with the HD version(like Mangonel/Onagers/Siege Onager shots were faster before Chemistry,....).   I prefere to buy all of the dlcs. In the Forgotten Empires DLC there are now one unique- research for every civilisation added. There are some techh-trees changes, that improoves the game a little bit more. In the African Kingdoms DLC, camels are no longer definied as 'boats' so they are now better against buildings and the research heated shots now doesen't makes extra damage against camels, which is a huge change.   I like the fact, that there is the steam workshop added for the game, that means that you can install texture packs, maps, custom scenarios, custome AI's (Like Ressonace Bot and Bruteforce,....) and much more stuff, that the community is creating for the game.  When I bought the HD edition the multiplayer servers were very bad and the game started to lagg at the beginning of the game. Right now the servers are improved and the multiplayer is now 'playable'  One thing, that i don't like about the HD expansion is, that enemies can glitch through you walls and can easily raid your economy, which is a little bit annoying. With double walls and some castles you can avoid that pretty easy  Beside this little bug I personly think that buying the HD Version was totaly worth it! And I like to play with the new DLC civilations."
This game is cool.
Remind me old school strategy games. Nice and extended type of battles and ages. I recommend you all.
"If you were born between 1990-2000, please buy this.  If you are a crazy fan of RTS, please buy this.   For me, this is a memory of all my childhood and youth. I've deeply attracted when I'm 5. And, together with other RTS games, my computer is completely captured by RTS for 10 years.   You have to know that in China, It's quite difficult to buy a genuine game in early years. Thanks Steam that give me a chance to pay for this marvelous game.   Well, leave the emotional part, the reason for me to recommend this game is that , there's so many concept that appeared and affect the following RTS games. Multiple resources makes you crazy about how to spare your workers work efficiently. And the most interesting part of the game is that there's a huge complex counter system in this game. Archer counters infantry, while cavalry counter archer. Meanwhile, pikeman could also make great damage to cavalry. Some civiliazation's unique unit can handle melee well. Some is master in against archer. However some could handle others' unique unit. It's quite hard to handle your army in a limited population. This complex system makes the whole series of Age of Empires games great. But this also make 1 single games could last for 2 or 3, even 4 hours:(   Another great features of this games is that it widen the victory condition. You can build your own Wonders and keep it safe or you can kill enemy's king. What's more, you can just control a hill for a period of time. The change that inherited from Age of Empires makes this game more interesting(or just kill the useless time:) )  Last is that from all Age of Empires series, the importance of navy is increasing. While look at other games, only Red Alert series emphasized the importance of the navy like Age of Empires. The control of sea also means you could have more ways to gather food. Or beat your opponments hard.   Oh forget one thing. If you want to learn history, why not try all Age of Empires series? Age of Empires 2's history is ranged from the Fall of Rome to Columbous' exploration. And the 3's story is after until the WWI explode. Believe me, this game is the best history teacher than anyone in the world!!!  Finally...this is really a great game. If it's on sale. Don't hesitate to buy it. Even to nowadays, in my view, it's still one of the best RTS games in the world.  啊啊啊用英文码那么多字好累QWQ"
"a classic for sure and a very challenging and fun game to play all together, i highly recommend this one."
"You are under attack  Save one villager,  rebuild the second empire and take revenge  You are under attack again "
good version of age of empires
great game such war. no more memes ;) i like this game very much i play this in my childhood so yeah the main story is difficult and i like it :)  so i recommend this
"Same great game, terrible for newer large resolution monitors."
wolololol  yes  no  attack an enemy now  14  10/10
"This Game was the most fun I had in years, if you ever dreamed of building an Empire, and have full domination of your kingdom and battle others in a royal war. Then I recommend this game for you. There is a tiny problem with multiplayer, some players install god mode mods which makes so they won't die, so yeah. But overall such a great lovely game!"
10/10
Very good game!   Brings back a lot of memories...  mainly of WOLOLO
"The only RTS i have liked, though it doesn't say that much as i have only played this and one or two command&amp;conquer games. Slow paced most of the time but it can become fairly hectic when you are commanding one army, trying to not kill your own soldiers with catapults and suddenly hear wolololo while you see someone attacking your village :D The singleplayer campaign has many different scenarios and are fun to play. Some are pretty hard with you against many opponents but at least in standard difficulty i have managed to win most on my second attempt when i know where the enemy are and how they will act."
Many Age. Such Empires  5/5
"Ehhhh, its ok like Still not as good as Zenojears"
"I mean, if you havn't played this already and consider yourself an RTS buff, then you have to give it a try. Even though it lacks some of the modern elements to RTS and the graphics are a bit lackluster. This was the bread and butter game of my childhood. A definite must play for all!"
Mother of RTS games.  + Very detailed and excellent gameplay.  - Price tag is not so fair.
Better graphics and an AI that deserves to be called opponent!
"So the amount of hours I have on this game is nothing compared to how much I spent on the original version of this game and its expansion. I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game back then. I knew most of the good cheat codes for stuff like the cobra car or who could ever forget the unit that you could only move by itself, Furious the Monkey Boy. It's insta kill move. Its a game that is just really great overall. Plus the fact that they made additional dlc for such a good game. While I myself haven't got the new dlc for this game I will at some point. Its a good game to just waste your time on."
"This is a great game, all i would play in the mid 2000s"
"Yeah, its pretty good I guess...."
Villagers hunt with bows but walk straight up to enemies. 11/10
"Childhood favorite game, is a must buy for those who like Real Time Strategy games. All time classic.  EDIT: files cannot be recovered when trying to restart a multiplayer game, games completely lost. No ETA on fix. Don't buy/play unless you can finish a game in one sitting."
Love This game !!! The Nostalgia xD
"Loved this game as a kid, still love it these days.  The HD looks amazing, the game runs great, and the new content is pretty on point as well. "
This game.... Is so good cant stop thinking about it!
"fun game, other then some lagging, still works great. worth the buy."
"Possibly the most well crafted game of all time  100% would recommend to any player, goes on sale frequently for up to 85% off. Grabbing this game and it's expansions will be the best $8 you've ever spent.  W o l o l o b o i z"
nostalgia i played this game when i was 5 years old
This game is good.
"Awesome game, particularly thanks to the overhauled multiplayer."
"Simply put, one of the very best real time strategy games of all time."
It's Age of Empires II. Of course it's good. That's not even a question.
"A classic. Very aged graphics, but the music and gameplay are both still beautful. Great to play with friends."
"- Played AoEII when me was a lad. - Loved it. - Grew up, still loved computers and AoEII. - Purchased and built custom $4k computer. - Purchased AoEII, as well as Fallout 4, Skyrim, GRID 2, FarCry 4, Metro: Last Light, and twenty (20) other games. - Play AoEII (a game released in 1999) FAR more than any other game I have (Good thing I bought that i7-4790k). - Wonder why in the hell I spent so much on a computer.  Buy the game. Let it consume you. More food please."
"Lets be honest its the same good old AoE II with same AI issues as it had years back. Worth buying if you want to check Forgotten Empire extension which adds new things.  Cant say much about multi yet. But its another reason to buy it if you have people to play with, despite some awfull server stability. This game is legend."
One of the greatest PC games ever made.
The closest outlet one can have as wish-fulfillment should anybody wish that Chinese people never existed at any point in time.
"What can I say about this gem of a game, have beening playing it forever. Just one of those games that your stuck by even after years and never gets boring!"
"Hands down my favourite game of all-time, in HD edition, AI has improved a lot, making games against computer even hard to win, big recommendation"
"Absolute ♥♥♥♥ game, buggy as all Hell, and the devs dont even fix the bugs because all they care about is $$$$$ do NOT waste your money on this 'High-Def' game. and the problem im having where it wont launch anymore even though, i've checked everything, this problem is being had by other people as well"
"A great game, and it's nice to have the option of a much higher pop cap. Oddly laggy though, even in single player, on a brand new gaming PC.."
I have always loved this game and bringing back multiplayer was a great move
"I got this game on discount for 4 EUR, but I would definitely NOT pay the 20 EUR original price for such an old game. The content is the same from AoE II The Age of Kings and The Conquerors expansion pack, but you can add some graphic and playability modifications through the Steam workshop. I had many problems with the installation (sometimes the game just does not want launch...) and many ppl have also reported having problems playing online, although I have not tried it yet. Overall it is a decent nostalgic experience, but it is not worth 20 bucks. Wait for it to go on sale."
My favourite strategy game and pretty muchy my favourite thing about Microsoft. So glad they decided to develope it further. I highly recommend it especially if you have friends to enjoy it with.
"Still an amazing game after all this time. One thing I do miss is the old LAN mode. Other than that game has quite a few extra new things. New AI you can play against or you can play against the old AI. I've never been good enough to play ranked but elo and ranked games are available. Mods that have been added via steam are good. Overall, this is a staple of the real time strategy genre. If you played the original and liked it get this version."
"Definitely love the game. My play time on Steam is simply cute compared to how many hours I've actually spent playing this game.  While everything is as it was before, the title 'HD' might be a bit misleading. Maybe they should've named it 'Age of Empires II Widescreen Edition' since that's all it is.   While they've had their hands on the game, I'd expect a few fixes or enhancements. Such as;   - Putting in a good waypoint system, like they have in Age of Mythology. It'd be very useful to be able to set a waypoint for a monk to collect a relic and then place it into your temple.  Or set up the foundations for a few buildings and have your peasant follow them in the order that you've set them. Instead of only building what foundations they can see, starting from the last one.  And having your peasants continue repairing other buildings after you've ordered them to repair one. Or at least the ability to set up a few repair orders. Come on, you're all gamers, you know what I mean...  - Your soldiers being able to follow moving targets; You see an enemy unit and direct your soldier(s) towards it and then you go back to doing something else. Since you always have something else to do in this game... And then two minutes later you see that unit still walking around, doing whatever, because your soldiers didn't actually go to that unit as you ordered, but just walked to the spot the enemy was on when you clicked on it.   - A number for how many units you have selected, instead of seeing 60 (or whatever the actual number is) different portraits.   - Farms as unlimited sources of food. Or a better way to renew them. Maybe the ability to place farm orders for each new windmill... (Instead of having a limited universal order)  - A way to see short buldings behind tall buildings. (It can be really hard to repair a wall behind a castle) I know another strategy game that certainly has the right idea for it.  - And maybe a hero for each faction? Come on, it wouldn't hurt... Well, it'd hurt your enemies but... That's why we have soldiers, no?  But probably this (writing this) was a waste of time. Well, didn't hurt me.  No actual players were hurt in the typing of this article. (I did get a bit peckish though)"
Best game of my childhood! Brings back great memories!
It very good. Many memory
Remains as one of the best RTS of all time.
Awsome
"Even if you never had the opportunity to play this classical game when it was first released and therefore have nostalgia for it, I still think that if you can see beyond the slightly old graphics and pathfinding problems that this game occasionally has, that you would really enjoy it.  Take the chance to play as a historical civilization such as the Mayans, Britons, Spaniards and so on. and make sure that their glorious legacy lives forever on.  The HD makeover just adds to the experience, with improvements throughout the game, I'd say that it was a well made HD-remake, not one of the more 'Cash-Grabby' ones which do appear from time to time. Even though you could still claim that the graphics look 'dated' I just think that it adds to the experience and wouldn't want it any other way.   The campaigns alone would make this game worth purchasing in my opion, but if you have a couple of friends to play this game online with, then this game will bring you hours upon hours of entertainment and you'll be talking about you mighty victories and shameful plays... for days/weeks maybe even months after they happened.  So, if you like strategy games and can look beyond the slightly dated graphics and somethings wonky pathfinding. Then you have yourself a really nice game here, a gem from days yonder that will never come again and well worth your consideration.  The expansions are in no way required, unless you want some more campaigns to put your teeth into and a few more civilizations from online play, but never fear, there are random civilizations that are available to play online every week, so you get a chance to experience the civilizations in the campaigns, even if you don't own the expansions.  Please consider it as your next bout into a strategy game. You won't regret it."
The Greatest RTS that Ever Was or Will Be...
It hasn't aged one bit &lt;3
I'm not sure what makes this game tick. So simple mechanics yet one of the best... Even if it's graphics are revised this is my nomination for The “Test of Time” Award of steam. Look at all those players alter all those years.
"A blast from the past, awesome classic game with endless hours of stratergy either against ai or players or friends. "
It's unfortunate that this game took too long to be brought to a playable state online to capture anyone's interest
love this game for a time killer allways enjoyable 
Steam let's us experience this game in the best way. Strongly reccomend it.
"This game is really fun, but it won't work on my computer anymore. I don't know why but if you want me to continue to use this program you have to fix it."
even better than when i was in 2nd grade 
Good old age of empires at it best. Must have
It provided an opportunity for me to be crazyed of study of Military
 Plz add some new trigger function for new scenario and make new look for this game TRIGGER Should Add in this game 1.) Unit Duplicator : Can Duplicate Any unit you want
It's my favorite real-time strategy game. How much time I spent with it!
Still good after all this time.
"Personally i think its the best way to introduce someone to strategy games &lt;3 its simple but not overly so , its fun and you learn history! :3"
Old but Gold
A great classic this game was my childhood
"Seeing a great classic being remade is always a wonderfull experience and thats what this is, I have played many hours of the original and now having it on steam made me proud. This is by far the greatest stratigy game i have ever witnessed.  So if your thinking of perchasing, this is a must to any steam libraby worth boosting about or not.     10/10 (amazing)"
Great to replay this game once again! higly reccomend to other to buy it if you ever loved the franchise when you were younger :D
"I loved the game. I loved that it was HD. But since the new DLC its unplayable for me. I have 1 hour since then. Why you ask? Not cause its a bad DLC.. No cause me, and so do my friends, have lags as hell. The game is unplayable. Even against bots. If it would be only me i would think its something with my PC.. But no, its not only me. And it hurts me a little.. Cause i loved to play this in my spare time."
"an amazing game, and a steal at current sale prices. i remember playing this game over a deade ago, and i still play it to this day."
not that good as it was in 2008 :S
"I loved this game ever since I seen it displayed on laptops in PC world as a child. Start from nothing and conquer the world (or map). What's not to like? Who needs allies?  Also, it's very addicting."
I've played this game way back in the day. Got excited when I saw it on steam. Great game to play and waste some time on.
I WANT TO REBUY THE GAME FOR FREE UO GSTUPIDE A$$ES!
"The day has finally come! This is a true rebirth of AoE2. Looks great, Everything works amazing. Props to steam for giving this classic another life, one it deserves. Huge community behind this one. New Expansions coming out for a game this old is unheard of! LOVE LOVE LOVE,  buy this game now and stop waiting!! 10/10"
I still remember when i played aoe2 Demo long back when i was in middile school HD brings back those great memmories when i bunked class to play  Thank you for the awsome improvements  and yeah the forgotten expansion with India is just great
One of the defining games of my childhood and responsible for most of my knowledge on medieval history. The HD version is just that; no bug fixes or gameplay changes. Intending to play the campaign again just like the good old days.
A classic RTS that any RTS fan will love.
I've played it short and do not regret a minute.
"had this game when it first released on my old windows pc back in the late 90's, was addictive then and is more addictive now, never played online when i first owned it, but now its amazing, i always get my ♥♥♥ handed to me online, but i still go back for more, hd remaster makes it even better"
Big ping and lag problems in multiplayer.   But the game is hella good anyways!!
"Ofcourse I have to recommend my favorite childhood game, but why u no Linux or mac support windows! greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :p"
been playing this since i was a kid Modern RTS games can still learn from this game
"Pros: - The game feeling realy reminds of the original game. - As far as i can say, the game is quite balanced. - Funny to play in multiplayer, especially with some friends. - The campaign is quite interesting, too.  Cons: - Since the release of the new addon there occur some problems when playing online, which had been fixed in earlier versions. Unfortunately they are not fixed yet. (Especially things concerning synchronisation and saving in online mode was very good before the addon) "
"I made my ally take all the attacks from two enemy civs, built up 15 trebuchets, then tore the enermy a new you-know-what. 10/10 would decimate cities again"
Great game I can't stop playing
Gives you the feeling of saying GG to someone before attacking their Base or multiple Bases it also give you the feeling to say GG and quit once they are 8 researchs ahead of you
The last update contain bucks on the damage produced by tower
It's the same Age of Empires 2 you know and love... but better.

"A blast from the past, awesome classic game with endless hours of stratergy either against ai or players or friends. "
I spent most of my childhood playing this game. What more do I have to say?
Best of the Age of Empires!
There's nothing like razing a village to the ground with 100 Persian war elephants.  10/10 ancient genocide simulator deserves the “Test of Time” Award!
Best 'Wololo' simulator of ever
Remains as one of the best RTS of all time.
Was fantastic 15 years ago and is still awesome.
"This game is very good, but poor graphics and you get fooked in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in multiplayer"
Old but Gold
"Personally i think its the best way to introduce someone to strategy games &lt;3 its simple but not overly so , its fun and you learn history! :3"
Best RTS I've ever played. Lots of nostalgia from this game.
It's my favorite real-time strategy game. How much time I spent with it!
Still good after all this time.
"A classic? No, this is THE Classic."
"Its a very fun and time consuming game((when played with friends)), like sessions can be an hour+. Have the ai as strong or as weak as you want, feel like a god crushing ants, or a hero defeating giants. Either way, I'm sure you'll find plenty to enjoy. Make your own custom maps, it takes a long time to make them, but I think its worth it.  Played it as a kid and I still love it today, so have fun, and enjoy."
"Timeless, endless age of empires 2.  This game has truely stood the test of time being as much fun today as it was the day it came out. The ' HD-Remaster' does not get in the way of nostalgia but instead does a good job of making it a little bit easier on the eyes that have become used to at least 1920x1080 at 60fps.  Bought the original game when i came out, lost the disk, bough 'HD' version on steam, never regretted it. 9/10"
Amazing fun with friends. Only con is a typical game takes 30 min or more.
BEST GAME 10/10 IGN
This is a glorious strategy game that I recommend to anyone who plays strategy games with a total of 500 pop cap it gives large fighting that most unmodded games dont give plus the steam workshop and other mods makes this game amazing
Best RTS without a doubt! Played for hundred of hours back in the good ol' days :) Now finaly here!
Just Get It!  You Won't Be Disappointed!
"One of the greatest strategy games of our time; it will continue to provide challenging scenarios and hours of entertainment, many years after it's original release."
"I loved this game when I first played it all those years ago. Still love it now. Addictive Gameplay, and an RTS Style that you simply cannot find in anything anymore. It even beats out most Civilization games in my opinion. If you have never played this game, and you love RTS genre games, this NEEDS to be in your library. The dev team also did a FANTASTIC job coming out with new expansions for this old game that blends seemlessly together. Call it bias, call it nostalgia, this is one of the best games that has ever existed."
Wololo ! Quit touching me ! Start the game already !
"I used to play this game a lot years ago. My friends and I picked it up and have been playing in matches against the computer.  + lots of history flavored units and buildings + lots of variety + multi-player is why I bought it and it does not disappoint + random map generation + you get to build castles, and walls, and kill baddies + I love winning by Wonder or by Relic + lots of single player and multi-player content  - there are waay too many civilizations sometimes - don't like how you can't research 100% for your civilization; that it measures what you've researched against all possible technologies - the map editor doesn't have basic editing features like palettes and brush sizes - when the game is over it pauses the game and then tells you to quit--why don't you just pause the game and bring up the pertinent menu? seems lazy to me - the single player campaigns did not hold my attention"
Fantastic rebuild of the game of my childhood. Continued support from dedicated (and community-involved) Devs! New content and the same amazing strategy-focused gameplay as originally designed.
"I have been playing this game on and off since this game was released back in the pre-2000 era of games. And this game has more than withstood the test of time. LAN parties, online games, mods and custom expansions; Just name it! As a whole this game really landed the definition of Real Time Strategy with a great historical feel and absolutely phenomenal mechanics.  10/10, will definitely be playing again."
This game should be Nominated for Test of Time award. This game is truly timeless
"The second of a line of RTS classics. Might be old, but it feels like my inner child likes to remember good old times..."
  it's alright
"oh god, the crash"
does it still need a review?
skyrim with guns
"Everyone should give this game the, 'Best Use of a Farm Animal Award' for their accurate portrail of sheep."
It stands the test of time.
"Loved this game 15 years ago, and still love it today. Very few games keep that kind of replayability."
"I have played this game occasionally since the late 90s. It was my first RTS game and I loved it ever since. The graphics are timeless, the controls are simple, the strategies are endless, and online gameplay is smooth. This HD Remake comes with more civilizations, maps, upgrades, and increased population limits. Definitely worth the price."
"One of the best games ever, imo."
"Pretty good, i guess."
Old but gold
Stands the test of time better than any other game I can think of.
used to love playing this LAN back in the hood days
So good until today that makes you think where the RTS gaming industry has gone wrong...
"This is truly a game for the ages. There are so many other RTS games and even several more in this series, but it always comes back to Age of Empires 2. The gameplay is excellent, the civilizations are similar enough to make them familiar, but JUST different enough for some strategy. It provides both multiplayer and casual fun with smashing armies into computers in single player."
The memory is back.
"An incredible classic, this game truly stands the test of time."
This is my 'Test of Time' nomination.  Being over 17 years old now this game still gaining expantions to add on to the massive amounts of content that already exists. The game truly has stood the test of time and will hopfully continue it's life span for years to come.
21  29  30  11 11 11
Thia game is never get old.
This game is still a great game (don't mind my hours on steam). I played this game so much back in the day and love it. Saw it on steam and got some friends to get it as well and it still reminds me of the old days. This version is not without its faults like there is a little bit of latency in between what you want to happen to when it does happen but later on in the game you tend to forget about it as you are focusing on a lot of things.
Possibly the best RTS ever made.
The best out of the three.
World best game ever .... I am playing from last 15 Years ... Awesome as HELL
"This game is extremally fun, Totally worth your 20$!"
Nostalgia at it's finest. Great game to relive the glory days.
A classic RTS that has been had an update and new content added. If you are into RTS or are wanting to get into these types of games then this is where to start. It has stood the test of time and is still fun to this day
"Best RTS game, now in HD form. Get this if you're into real-time-strategy, or if you enjoy blowing up your helpless enemies with masses of cannonballs."
"This game justifies the price tag as the content it has is much more than just HD texture packs. There are all the expansions, different game types and civilizations to choose from which will keep one engaged for hours. I have myself clocked more than 10 hours offline in it. One of the best strategy games ever."
"Not really in HD, poor multiplayer support."
"This game. This game is my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ childhood. Loved it then, love it even more now. This is the strategy game that birthed modern strategy gaming. Classic RTS gameplay, customization, historical backgrounds for the nerds like me. You will be hard pressed to be dissapointed by this game.  Zerg rushing with Huns 123/10"
Its fun
I challenge every single one of you to pick a better game for Timeless Classic!
"The most satisfying historical RTS I've played, with a savory balance of economy building, history and military strategy. In all honesty, neither one of these categories is extremely realistic or accurate, but to me it makes for greater playability and gratification this way.  UPDATE: 2 years later, the game has a new mod and is still great. This game will never go out of fashion!"
Childhood amaze! very nice. much play...for real tho...played the ♥♥♥♥ outta this game when iwas young! Worth the buy!!
"Hands down the best RTS game ever, and is still going strong. Easy to pick up for new players as well.  (Nominated as well for the Autumn Sale 2016)  10/10"
A timeless classic RTS.
I was a king in my childhood.
"I so happy when this went on Steam as i had been playing the games on their orginal disk, but with operating systems coming out every year I know ill have this game for many more years"
"As great as I remember , note that if you have problems with sync and lag download the open beta 4.8 it will fix it"
A great game that is infinitely replayable. Age of Empires is the greatest strategy series of all time!
great game!
"Just as I did in my childhood with the original and AoE 2, chances are you'll spend most of your time in the map editor making absolutely massive armies of random units fight each other just to see the absolute carnage that will follow.  Ahh good ol' childhood memories of bloodshed and watching battlefields littered with corpses rot away and leave nothing but skeletons and armour everywhere. Amazing how this game still holds up beautifully to this date, still incredibly addictive and entertaining to no end. Staple franchise that introduced thousands into the RTS genre back in the 90's.  Great introductory game to the genre of RTS or even for more hardcore players. Some of the battles can leave whole stretches of maps full of corpses and wrecked wooden vehicles."
A great game.
find all the sheeps
"I'm doing this for badges. At any rate, good game even after all this time."
"AOE II Is a game I played almost exclusively for almost 5 years, I may not have much time logged in the steam version but I've spent many many hours playing this game, just messing around against bots and playing some of the most intelligent matches I've played in any RTS or game period. The level of tactics required is not as high as other games like Hearts of Iron III of even CIV IV but it is a game with much depth and much to learn, I highly recommend it. "
"This is the game that got me into pc gaming, trully a game that will never go out of style in my opinion. If you have the means, I would suggest you get it."
+1
"I use to play this game a lot. It works well, doesnt crash and doesn't take long to learn again."
"8/10  As someone who's played this game from childhood, I have a completely objective view when reviewing this game. No bias involved.  Something that's entirely underappreciated about this game is its sound design. I love the building noises, music, and taunts. It has a broad and diverse selection of nations, and a variety of units and technologies. The HD update improves the textures for a lot of ugly graphics from the original. You can play it with friends or against AI, in whatever gamemode you want. You can play many campaigns that follow historical medieval figures. Overall, this game has tons of character for an RTS. It's fun, interesting, and timeless. Besides, you learn a lot of history."
The best RTS.
Childhood memories piled up in an exquisite game which has survived through the ages. Love it!
Pros:  -Age of Empires II HD  Cons:   -Nothing  10/10
Yo let me play this on Mac tho dawg.
this is a awesome game!!!
I remember buying this game for 2 dollars on ebay when I was like 5 years old and being so excited that I could finally play a game on our ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2003 gateway.
"The graphics update is great. The multiplayer is fun. If you're into this sort of thing, you're probably a nerd, but that's okay. I don't know if there's any real benefit or wow factor in this game but, it's mindless yet invigorating. Good for the blossoming ADHD kid."
childhood ;-;  100000000000000000000000000000000000000/10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
"As good as it was in my childhood but with the simplicity of the Steam Hub. Nervertheless, a little bit too expensive for the content (DLCs...)"
"Played this game alot before the HD edition was released on Steam. Overall a fantastic game. There is still an active online community. As well as some great youtubers who review games played by competitive players (bbqturkman comes to mind). There is lots of strategy involved, but the game doesnt evolve much through the different ages. Theres only 4 different ages, and they are all medieval ages, which isnt a problem for me, but games like Empire Earth or even 4X games like Civilization span from the dark ages all the way to the futuristic ages, which is something this game doesnt feature. Great purchase, often on sale, pick it up if youre looking for a great RTS game."
"I thouroughly enjoy playing this game, the AI never fail to test my skills, and patience. The graphics are absoloutely scrumptious, and fit the style of game nicely. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games "
Good ol' Age of Empires.
a verry good game
"One of the best game I have been playing with pleasure, though I am too silly."
Fantastic! I had this game when I was 10 glad to see it rereleased on Steam.
I like this game but i find it vary frustrating when i click the play now button for the game and nothing happens...
"It's a little buggy during multiplayer, but Age of Empires II HD is a fantastic remaster of a classic game."
"A timeless classic of an RTS game, still as fun as I remembered the original version was back in 1999! 10/10 would definitely recommend!"
I played this game when I was child after like 15 years still playing it...and I'm still trash at it which should say somthing for how good it is
"Greatest RTS, actually greatest game of all time."
THE ONE AND ONLY RTS!!
"Really a good old classic game,hope for more updates and civilizations and if you like strategy games I advice you to buy this one"
"Never gets old... Never.. Played it when I was 5 years old, played it when I was 19 years old... Still had continues and interesting games. One of the best and most legendary RTS of our time."
"Oh boy the childhood memories, I dumped probably thousands of hours into this as a child and it's still just as good as it was then."
I've been playing this game since 1998 and I believe I'll play it forever
no need another RTS
Still as good as when it was released :) JUST UPDATED GRAPHICS AND MULTIPLAYER
It brought back memories of the good old day. But if it's ur first time playing it will feel 'Old'. A game from a different time.
"After all these years, my wife, the kids and I still fire this game up and have fun :) Also leads to a bit of a history lesson for the family. I enjoy the straight forward nature of this RTS, before they get too complicated with Heroes or move from Rock Paper Scissors to a convoluted game of 'Rock, Paper,Scissors,Lizard,Spock'."

"Age of Empires II, released in 1999 and still surviving to 2016 with new content, how does a game so old survive over 15 years and yet still maintain interest? This is one such game.  Age of Empires II HD gives new life combining old and new, the graphics are decidedly outdated but still maintain a sense of luster that doesnt turn you away, but rather endears you to what games used to be like. They gave them new life.  The gameplay is indepth, random, and the AI can be absolutely brutal if you want a challenge or want it easy, dont like playing with people, enjoy the multitutde of story based missions and campaigns that span multiple historical eras.  The story is well written, fairly accurate, if you can call a lone villager building an entire town spanning several hundred years and still happy to keep serving it's oppressive overlord accurate. You'll enjoy the voiced over characters, the story of taking men and women from the birth of their career to the very height such as Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Atilla the Hun, the list is fairly extensive between this game and the dlc's.  It is a game worth buying for new players or reminding old players of what it truly meant to play an RTS game that has class, charm, and still some of the strongest AI I've ever encountered.  10/10"
great game when it was released and still great to play with friends
"A legend in new suit. Still enjoy playing it, good as it was at the millenium, now with new quests! I just hope someone will also make a SW: Galactic Battlegrounds HD as well"
",,,"
"Look at the other reviews to see how AoE II is a timeless classic. I'm just here to say that this is a timeless piece of software: the devs remain engaged with the community and they keep releasing patches, even though it already worked great (for me at least) two years ago.  And if you have the money, you can look forward to a new, pretty decent DLC every year or so (this release already comes with the old The Conquerors expansion, though).  So what I'm saying is that if you're like me and were turned off by Steam re-releases of classic strategy games like HoMM III: HD, that doesn't mean you'll be disappointed by this."
"Still the best RTS game out there. With new update and DLC, it seems that there are more players playing than ever before. Lots of bugs have been fixed with new update. Lots of downloadable content, scenarios etc. Really recommend buying it after 500 hours of playing it, still fun and interesting."
It is good old AoC. Only con is the new keybind system. If you are used to the old mapping it could be difficult to play with new. For this I expect at least an in game feature as 'Return the key bindings to old system.'  Edit: There are workshop items for returning old kb system but after a while new kb system is growing on you.
"VERY WELL GAME, NEED MORE graphics QUALITY ONLY."
This game is amazing i've always liked it and I recommend this game many hours of fun.
"Play vs old AI on standard, Smash them. Play vs new AI on standard, i just got castle age they have been imperial age for 5+mins, get smashed. 10/10 would lose again"
Love this game 10 hiel hitlers out of 10
"As good as ever! Hope they would fix the backend, and performance issues before they release more content.."
any idea why it want let me play a standerd game? says something wasnt found!!!
"The hostory, stratedgy and the fact I have enjoyed it solo and with others."
So good it makes me cry from joy 
CLASSIC! A must!
Best stretegic game in the market P.S my childhood game easly in my top 3 favourite game of all time
Really good game. A classic and old school game. One of the first games I've played back in the day. Really worth buying it again.
i've playe this game since I was 6 years old I still love it man
Is very good yes
"IT'S BAD. I regret buying it.  (note, includes African Kingdoms and Forgotten campaigns). The artwork put into the structurse in African Kingdoms is truly a sight to behold... but that's really all the praise I have for it. It's clearly intended to cater for people who still like AOE2's multiplayer mode.  Little improvement upon AOE2's outdated setup. It's extremely buggy and prone to crashes. The interface and AI is shamefully bad and the gameplay is really quite boring and annoying. Expect units (yours and enemy alike) to get confused, distracted by irrelevant targets, and often getting stuck and tangled as they attempt to form pointless formations (you can't turn it off).  Worst of all are the campaigns. Hardly any building, almost all are 'take this small group to that part of the map'. So you sit bored out of your mind as you guide your clumsy squad around an obstacle course where every 'combat' situation involves your squad slowly chipping away at an enemy until they (eventually) win."
"Age of Empires II brings back alot of old memories for me. In my opinion it is the original strategy game. This is one that has truely stood the test of time. I would definetely pay up to $30 to get this game again. If you havent really played strategy games before and are looking for a simple intro, or just want to see what the fuss is about its well worth your time."
"One of the best games ever made, playing for last 12 years."
I used to play this when I was 5 Xd
"In memory of years i spend on this game, for the Empires's sake i would be more at peace if they would fix the bugs on forgotten packs. But although these kind of things that is epic to see oldie maps in HD and living the childhood memories again."
A classic that is truly to be adored. Highly recommended.
"A great game, one of the best RTS of all time."
"Grew up with this game, still suck at it though. But it doesn't matter, I can still play it to this day!"
"As good as old times, same problems of old times. Avoid MP."
"Age of Empires II, released in 1999 and still surviving to 2016 with new content, how does a game so old survive over 15 years and yet still maintain interest? This is one such game.  Age of Empires II HD gives new life combining old and new, the graphics are decidedly outdated but still maintain a sense of luster that doesnt turn you away, but rather endears you to what games used to be like.

great game when it was released and still great to play with friends
wololo 10/10 would convert again
"One of my favorite RTS games. Actually, the only RTS game I play. Played this since I was a kid, easily clocked in 200x the amount of time I've played on steam, still having fun with it.   Also, the soundtrack is amazing."
Such a classic game that you really cant go wrong with if you love history or RTS.
"After all these years, my wife, the kids and I still fire this game up and have fun :) Also leads to a bit of a history lesson for the family. I enjoy the straight forward nature of this RTS, before they get too complicated with Heroes or move from Rock Paper Scissors to a convoluted game of 'Rock, Paper,Scissors,Lizard,Spock'."
♥
The perfect RTS. Great to play with friends.
This game is a nostalgia machine for someone like me who played the first Age of Empires on my older cousin's PC back in the day. Glad to see it on Steam.
It never gets old beating enemies and rounding up all those sheep so I keep them as pets and don't murder them for their meat.  Til bardaga!
I wish i had as much time to play this as i did in my childhood
Great game since 1350
"Had this game since '99. Bought it again with the M$ RTS collection awhile back ( which I own all on CD) for the sake of not carrying the CDs with me. Also hoped to be able to play on my older computer, yet I cannot since it has been optimized. So if youre looking for games to use on older machines, this and the bundled ones wont be able to. Otherwise, It still holds up just like almost 20 years ago.   protip for online matches though: do not create maps of ludacris size; the coding cannot handle it and will lag and eventually crash the match."
Simply Wololo
CLASSIC! A must!
Best strategy game tbf
"Play vs old AI on standard, Smash them. Play vs new AI on standard, i just got castle age they have been imperial age for 5+mins, get smashed. 10/10 would lose again"
Really good game. A classic and old school game. One of the first games I've played back in the day. Really worth buying it again.
Best stretegic game in the market P.S my childhood game easly in my top 3 favourite game of all time
Amazing game that still manages to take hours of my time to this day
"In Age of Empires II, each of the civilzation's has hundreds of possible traits, including a unique selection of: units, buildings, and technologies. WIth 31 civilizations, even skilled veterans have not mastered every civilization in the game. Because the civilizations use the same base units, buildings, and technologies, knowledge of one civilization is somewhat applicable to another. There is no 'best way to play this game', as every style can be countered. As each 'type' of unit can be countered by another 'type'; it is really important to have a military composition that contains different 'types' of units.  Early game demands: setting up, and planning out your economy; exploring the map for resources and choke points; as well as communicating with your team mates, and planning out your overall strategy. You must balance your time: perfecting the efficiency of your economy, while advancing and managing your military interests. Upgrading and maintaining complex military compositions, formations, and unit countering demand attention: and only the most experienced and efficient players can manage their economy and military simultaneously."
AOE in HD??? HELLS YEAH!
dagum  wololo  food please  start the game already  wood please
will never get old its timeless
It's got llamas in it.
You should definitely give it a try. This is one of my favourite strategy games I've ever played and I remember how my father kicked my ♥♥♥ with the Persian elephants.lol xD
Still best game since 1999 :D
Was fantastic 15 years ago and is still awesome.
"This game is as great as it was when I bought it on release day! Even better, even because it includes new content and is optimized for newer systems"
I cannot believe that was able to play it with friends and with almost no lag and drops at all as the old version had so issues in this aspect. It is good to see a cult classic again and working flawlessly on a modern PC.
Still as good as the first day I played it 13 years ago.
"one of the all time classics, brings back a lot of good memories :D  hope we get to see new civs added with time, keep up the good work on this one devs!"
Love love love this game! It's a fantastic multiplayer strategy game. I've played it for years and years and it's still always fun.   Just play it. Trust me.
This game finally feels like a modern day age of empires
So I'm supposed to be playing Age of Empires II HD but this one player keeps kicking my ♥♥♥...
"Hands down, the most strategic game. Dodging arrowfire from archers and working on different and new META strategies for the 10+ civilisation's.  I plan to play 1000+ more hours on this 17 year old game and i doubt I'll ever be fed up of playing. Plus the developing team are great at responding."
I use to play when i was young till now this game is too much fun/enjoyment this game will never get old but other will do.
Childhood.. ✊
"Bought the original when it first came out along with the expansion later on, and was hooked. I could not even guess how many hours I put into the game. I played others in the series, along with similiar games but kept coming back to this one over and over.  I was worried about picking the HD remake up fearing that it would not stand up compared to my memory of the game, like so many other games I have gone back to play years later. But I decided to buy it, and I am not disappointed.  I look forward to reliving the campaign, long with the two new expansions. Maybe even checking out what is available in the workshop."
I think this game should win a steam award prize 'cause it is awesome! 50 years old but never boring
Well it is a legend and still great game to play :)
this game is a good game
A classic among classics!
Timeless Classic.
"This game came out in 1999, but it's still the best strategy game ever! 10/10"
10/10
  nice game part of my childhood
One of the best games of all time.
"Old, but Gold"
It is trully a classic. Many good memories.
"11/10 - Gonna WOLOLO the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone again,"
Still incredible
"I had fun back in the early 2000's when i got the game. I just bought the HD version, i still have fun. One of the greates RTS out there. :)"
"One of the greatest RTS games of all time. Never grows old, I was ever so glad when they released the HD version. I used to play the orignal Age of Empires 2 Age of Kings + The Conquerors like crazy when I was younger.  In addition to that, I love the fact that a lot of what I know about history was learnt through this game (or motivated to look into because of this game). XD  A definite go-to for any fan of RTS genre or someone looking to explore it."
"  This game is literally crack. You'll be HOOKED on this game all night, and it would be almost 5AM. That's what happened to me.  Get it. It's a worthy classic. The Community is great, the game is fun, so many new strategies, and surprised from your opponents."
"I nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' award.  I first bought Age of Empires II when I was about 10 years old. I had saved up my allowance and some birthday money, and my mom drove me to Circuit City to plonk down $48.99 for the CD-ROM (I got the Gold Edition that came with both AoE II and The Conquerors.) I'm almost 26 now, and I still play this game regularly.   AoE II is RTS perfected. The different maps and civilizations allow for plenty of different strategy styles, but the gameplay remains simple and very streamlined, and is still superior (in my opinion, at least) to AoE III and Age of Mythology. The game has even held up visually as well (thought I do appreciate some of the improvements made in the HD edition.) Simply put, Age of Empires II is a timeless classic, and if you're a fan of the RTS genre and somehow haven't played it yet, you really should."
I once played this game as a sunday morning coffee.
One of the best games ever made
"Classic RTS, classic taunts, great game.  The HD update makes this game work better on modern systems."
The fact that people still play tgis game is proof enough how awesome it is. I couldn't wait to play this game on my 1500eur rig.
The definition of classic. One of the finest RTS games ever crafted. The HD edition adds more content than the original and revives multiplayer. Buy without any second thoughts.  UPDATE: Yep. still the best.
You should definitely give it a try. This is one of my favourite strategy games I've ever played and I remember how my father kicked my ♥♥♥ with the Persian elephants.lol xD
"A Classic! Very fun strategy game from the good old days! if you like strategy, and empire building this game is almost as good as AOE3! 5/10 Average!"
AoE and AoC - classic.
Timeless classic. Best RTS I've ever played.
Timeless Classic.
"This game came out in 1999, but it's still the best strategy game ever! 10/10"
"Still one of the best RTS around. It's very fun and challenging and still has a very active community behind it. I nominated it for the 'Test of Time' award here on Steam, as it's already been 14 years."
"This is Age of Empires II, with new HD textures, new factions, new campaigns, and steam multiplayer. Seriously dude, what do you want more ?"
"They say nothing lasts Forever, I say they never played Age of Empires then."
"Age of Empires 2 in my opinion is a really fun, classic game that has held up very well for the past ~16 years. However, there are some flaws about this game that I would like to point out.   PROS ------------------------------------- -The Multiplayer Is a Really Fun and Enjoyable Experience -Workshop Compatibility Allows For Things Such as Enhanced Textures, More Sounds, etc. -The Gameplay is Unique and Doesn't Take Too Long to Get The Hang of -With All The Different Civilizations, it Allows For New/Different Strategies and Gameplay Techniques to be Used -Graphics Aren't Too Great, Which Can Allow For Older Machines to Run This Game    CONS ------------------------------------- -Multiplayer Can Be Laggy (Especially Because of Steam) -Some Maps Can Become Boring After Awhile -Some Civilizations Can Easily Be Crushed, While Other Are Too Powerful -Although a Pro, the Graphics (again) Aren't Too Great, But Can Easily be Fixed With Some Workshop Addons  Even with these cons, AoE2 is a really fun game that you can always come back to  Final Score - 9/10"
"It's a game that I grew up playing. But only in Age of Empires can a dense forest be used an defensive measure for your walls. The only aspect of this game that can be frustrating is the amount of steps needed to actually get a good soldier. But once you get that arbalest, you're already being attacked by a swarm of soldiers. Nothing's changed from this from the old one except a slight boost in graphics. It is still an excellent game, that is more realistic in the building process (minus the hammering in the same nail for minutes aspect)."
My childhood reborn
"I ve got the cd of AoE 1 whit it s expansion, 2 cd of AoE 2 whit the expansion ( 1 of the cds has the expansion the other one has the expansion on another cd), 1 cd of AoE 3 alone and another cd of AoE 3 whit all it s expansions (arround 6 cs total for its expansions), I end up buying AoE 2 on steam and all the expansions ( I m going to buy the Raja's when it comes out) and I also bought AoE 3 on steam whit all it s expansions. ... I love this game and so will you !"
"One of the best games ever made, playing for last 12 years."

"In memory of years i spend on this game, for the Empires's sake i would be more at peace if they would fix the bugs on forgotten packs. But although these kind of things that is epic to see oldie maps in HD and living the childhood memories again."
"Age of Empires II brings back alot of old memories for me. In my opinion it is the original strategy game. This is one that has truely stood the test of time. I would definetely pay up to $30 to get this game again. If you havent really played strategy games before and are looking for a simple intro, or just want to see what the fuss is about its well worth your time."
"AOE II Is a game I played almost exclusively for almost 5 years, I may not have much time logged in the steam version but I've spent many many hours playing this game, just messing around against bots and playing some of the most intelligent matches I've played in any RTS or game period. The level of tactics required is not as high as other games like Hearts of Iron III of even CIV IV but it is a game with much depth and much to learn, I highly recommend it. "
"For many, this is about nostalgia, but I feel this game does indeed hold up as one of the grestest (and still great) RTS ever made. Amazing to think new content being made for AOEII, the fact that people still love this game, and presumably new fans as well..."
find all the sheeps
Best AoE ever. The nostalgia is unreal.
One of the first games I have ever played. Still love playing this game.
"What can i say, an ageless classic here. If you liked AoE before you will like the HD version with updated graphics,AI,balance and supported constantly with new dlc. If you dont know what AoE is, shame on you.But if you are into rock,paper,scissors games with multiple variables,eco management or generally good strategy you will like this ,a lot."
Old but Gold
"'tis just for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ badge, but great game (y)"
This game just brings back memories
"My thoughts in 50 words or fewer:  One of the most loved RTS classics that has stood the test of time. From the vast number of different civilizations to the sheer number of lovingly created mods, there are no shortages of ways to play this game. This is one game I will always recommend."
"Glad the peer to peer multiplayer works, at least for me. Can't tell you how much easier this is as opposed to LAN parties"
"Fantastic game that has truly stood against the test of time. The reviewers below cover many of the positives and negatives, so I'll just add one main point:  - Compared to alternative methods of playing this game, the HD edition is laggier and significantly buggier.  HOWEVER  - Compared to alternative methods of playing this game, the HD edition is easy to set up and coordinate with friends. MUCH easier. This for me more than makes up for the increased lag and other issues. This is especially important to me because many of my not-so-tech-savvy friends love to play AOE2 and this is simply the easiest way to arrange that."
"Walls, baby, walls.   I first played this game back when it was included for free with certain computers, sometime in the early 2000's. To this day it's remained a favorite among myself and other nostalgic gamers who remember when games were simple and complete. But in simplicity comes layers of complexity, and it is likely this aspect that has kept this game relevant to some degree.  Sure, it is it's own RTS experience, unlike many others in its genre. And of course, who can ignore the dense historical accuracy which informs each army's unique abilities? But this game hits on a certain self-indulgent gameplay that can keep most interested for some hours. Whether it be building layers and layers of walls (like me)to keep those pesky invaders out, or achieving diplomacy with each nation only to swarm their unsuspecting settlements, this game somehow hits on certain niche aspects that has kept me coming back for years. And somehow no other game has done quite so similar a thing.  The HD Edition features several updates that make the game seem at least new enough to appear like an updated game (like descriptions for upgrades!). And to be honest, there are definitely better strategy games out there, with more support, add-ons, and updates than this one can boast. But fear not: this game remains golden even in its former glory.   "
"This game never gets old, I recommend it for anyone who hasn't tried it yet, it's still easily the best RTS game out there. I'm still waiting for AOE IV!"
"Great game, timeless, and i played it when it came out, and still play it today."
Still one of the better RTS games around that has a well and alive multiplayer scene. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid RTS experience a bit slower than the classic RTS experience but also much grander and larger scale.
Bringing back the nostalgia of childhood LANs.
"  One classic, one legion, one of the best PC games ever"
"I used to play this game in first grade and its just as good, This game is worth it if you are a aoe vet."
"Simply amazing, and fun. Zero regrets."
"I played this game for the first time back in 2001 when I was 6. I can honestly say the game is just as fun, if not more so now than it was then. The campaigns are in depth, historical, and fun. I have yet to come accross another RTS game that has held my attention even half as long as this game. Have fun."
"I bought the legacy bundle for 60 and now it's 15... perfect.  Great game I've played it for a long time and still do, but this game is very time consuming."
Still the best strategy game out there!
The Best game EVER
Still one of the best RPG's I ever played. 10/10
"Wow, this game is something special. I might be a bit biased since this was the first video games I ever played, but it deserves to be in your Library. Engaging resource mangement, strategic combat, and decent multiplayer make this game a must have for strategy game palyers.   Although not much except for the DLCs and HD have been added since its release the game still holds up and has aged well."
This game is fun  
Age of Empires is probably the best real time strategy game you can buy on steam. The addition of updated AI alone is worth the extra cost to get the HD edition.
"This one is a classic. The HD remaster is really nice, played a few campaigns with no issues and enjoyed it a lot!"
"Amazing game. There are some small issues with networking, but the devs seem to keep the game in good shape. Keep it up!"
START THE GAME ALREADY
"One relic of old times, I still enjoy that one. interesting + great variety of possibilities.   Ps: Paladin = maybe the best unit :)"
"This game never gets old, I recommend it for anyone who hasn't tried it yet, it's still easily the best RTS game out there. I'm still waiting for AOE IV!"
"I can't play this, didn't run when I start it"
It's one of the best games I have played since I was a little kid and after 9 years I still play it and still it's a lot of fun 9/10 (because of the bad villager AI that gets on my nerves)
A fantastic game from childhood
Amazing game that still manages to take hours of my time to this day

After the last patch the game wont launch. How do I fix?
"I remember playing this all the time when I was a kid. Now that it gets new stuff added to it, it's both a roadtrip through nostalgia land and a tread through newer waters. AoE II not only still holds up, it gets better with age."
this game is a classic!
"The goats in this game are NOT easy to slay, let me tell you that. These are some strategic Goats.  If you need to slay some Goats...then...learn better goat strategies. 10/10"
Age of Empire ll is one of my favorite games.
"I highly recommend this game. It has evolved into such a vast, complex game, with a community still healthy and thriving. This game offers hours upon hours of content, from campaigns to multiplayer. The DLC are also great, just adding more to what is already an awesome and deserving game. To have a game that you valued in your childhood being supported by the FE team to this day is something that many games won't come across, and AoE2 has definately aged well after all the years."
great RTS game! I recomend for everyone to try!
"I love this clasic game, just bought it for my brother so we can play it again"
Why not have Tradional Chinese ? 
It's such an addicting game.
"a true classic, a top10 game for me... all the rts gameplay of the original in an updated packaging... a huge world of campaigns to explore together with workshop support... outstanding!  .......EDIT In view of the rajas dlc, i decided to add to my review, hoping that someone from the devs will pick it up and consider my suggestions for subsequent expansions: -look into civs from other eras, eg. from the original AoE I, like the Romans, Egyptians, Greeks, or subsets thereof, eg. the Spartans, Alexander's Macedonians etc. -look into civs from the AoE III, like the American indian tribes etc. -look into subsets of civs already included, eg. the Ninjas (off the japanese) or the Shaolin (off the chinese) , the Knights Templar, Knights of Saint John etc.  many thanks"
An oldie but a goody. So many different ways to play this game. On top of that all of the mods/steam workshop addons that are available add another breath of life into this game. Definitely one of my 'it's been how long?' games. On top of that you get to learn about great times/people in history!
"One of my favourites and now even on Steam so you can mod the game or collect trading cards or simply play with or against your friends. I definitely recommend you play this game (sandbox mode is far more awesome than the singleplayer story which is quite educating actually). Also, this is a classic!"
After coming out in 1999 it is still one of the greats and now even better with HD.
AOE2 HD is still the best strategy game. The new contens are good as well. Must Have!
pretty good
"You don't like this game? Wololo, you like it now. AoE II is simply the best RTS ever. Nothing better than converting an entire army of Persian Elephants, or building a wonder on the same spot where you razed the enemy base to the ground.  "
"The best immortal game ! Shut-up, buy it and vote for the test of time award."
Please add better data mod support.
This game just never gets old &lt;3 10/10 recommend
This game just brings back memories
"My thoughts in 50 words or fewer:  One of the most loved RTS classics that has stood the test of time. From the vast number of different civilizations to the sheer number of lovingly created mods, there are no shortages of ways to play this game. This is one game I will always recommend."
"They first PC game I ever played, still my favourite RTS. It isn't fllashy but the graphics still look good, it is a timeless classic which doesn't need to be asymetrical and is in really good balance because of it. The HD version still has desyncs and other problems but they aren't that frequent anymore and if you want a really stable perfomance and better players you can just patch voobly support. All in all highly recommended if you have any interest in RTS whatsoever."
I used to watch my dad play AoE/AoE2 all the time when I was younger so this is rather nostalgic. It's a top tier game and you should all play it&lt;3
Nostalgia is that you?
"Do you really need to read a review of this game? I mean, it's Age of Empires II, this game has aged as well as Jennifer Aniston. Just buy it."
"Loved this game ever since it was AoEII: Age of Kings 1.0c....and for that I nominated it for the 'stands the test of time' award  If you have any love for quick paced third person medievel combat strategy games, then you've probably already heard of this game. Age of Empires II remastered in HD is beautiful as well as challenging. You can play the 5 campaigns, the frantic random map game, or even a hellish death match with AIs or other steam players. After grasping the simple mechanics of using villagers to grow your economy and your troops to destroy those of others, it becomes a game of strategy to defeat your opponent. Ultimately you'll find how essential the raids and sieges of the real era was. There are some historical discrepencies, but what do you expect when it's games of Huns fighting Mayans?  Unfortuanatly, the game doesn't feel complete without The Forgotten DLC causing you to likely shell out some more, but the fact that it is quite cheap when it periodically goes on sale at 30% to 75% off keeps it from being a burden. It also will need a higher power computer to run some of the better features.  All in all, Age of Empires II HD is a great strategy game for any player to own.  EDIT: The new African Kingdoms DLC is really for hardcore fans, and the update/patch that came along with it is enough. Good addition and an easy pickup during sales, but definitely not necessary."
"The Steam version of this game is a great port of the original title. It works very well and has been updated to run on more modern computers, but does require the user to use lower their display resolution before starting the game to get the correct size user interface."
I played this game a long time ago with friends at my school. I am glad that I can keep playing this fantastic game with new and old friends.
Crush your enemies while learning history.
Loved this game since i was a little boy!
One of the best classic games available on steam.
A great game thats always fun to come back to. Its one of the must play games when you get together with your old highschool buddies at LAN parties.
the greatest RTS game I have ever seen
One of the best games i know! Really having fun playing with my friends. Rocks. The HD version is really OP!
Such a great game! Spent days and days and days playing this game before steam was a thing.
"Age of Empires II is definitely one of those games you just keep coming back to. Despite its age, it’s one of the best strategy games I have played. This game stands as testament that you don´t need fancy graphics to have some fun. It truly is a game that stands the test of time."
"Great game, timeless, and i played it when it came out, and still play it today."
played the original version a long time ago; then saw that this has easy multiplayer. great game 9/10
After all this years still gold! And the new add-ons work great too
This is easily the greatest stradegy game of all time. It has more than stood the test of time and its impact on the genre of stradegy is irrefutable. 11/10
Very good remastered of classic AoE!!!
This game just brings back memories
"My thoughts in 50 words or fewer:  One of the most loved RTS classics that has stood the test of time. From the vast number of different civilizations to the sheer number of lovingly created mods, there are no shortages of ways to play this game. This is one game I will always recommend."
"They first PC game I ever played, still my favourite RTS. It isn't fllashy but the graphics still look good, it is a timeless classic which doesn't need to be asymetrical and is in really good balance because of it. The HD version still has desyncs and other problems but they aren't that frequent anymore and if you want a really stable perfomance and better players you can just patch voobly support. All in all highly recommended if you have any interest in RTS whatsoever."
I used to watch my dad play AoE/AoE2 all the time when I was younger so this is rather nostalgic. It's a top tier game and you should all play it&lt;3
Still as fun as I remember from being a kid!
"A classic RTS game and a favorite for anyone who grew up in the 90s. Pure nostalgia, updated for screens twenty years more advanced than originally intended - 9/10 - Exactly what its supposed to be!"
"Edit : Game works great now! Thanks to the devs who work on updating the game daily.    This review is mainly concerning people looking to play online with friends.   I love AOE2HD but after the recent update the multiplayer is unplayable for me. The match starts - some guy gets a lag spike, and thats it boom, desync. The game desyncs and you lose rating. Rating is usually not important, but it sucks when people wont let you join matches because of your rating being low.  So far today I've not been able to play a single match without it getting desynced. I regret buying the new expansion so early. I'm not sure if its only for people who bought the expansion or everyone thats getting affected by it but it really sucks.  Before the update multiplayer had its issues but never as bad as this. "
This great is literally a Hitory teacher and time consumer.
"this game is a classic will never get old, updated graphics mean it will be playable for another 10 years well done guys 5/5"
It's crazy how I am putting so many hours into this game still like 10 years ago. I highly recommend buying this game if you are a fan of RTS's or simply want to get into it! If you are a veteran of this game I'd get the DLC. With the new civ's comes more different ways to approach the game which is really refreshing for a player like me who has been playing this for ages.
a classic back from the froggoten ones. awesome game worth it especially if you buy the collection for 20 $ thanks steam
One of the best strategy games of all time. I played this over a decade ago when I was younger and it is still going strong today! Strong community with lots of updates and mods too!
  my favourite and one of the best rts of all time
I absolutely Love this game!!!
Only get's better with Age.
This is the game i used to play when i was a kid. I'm not a kid anymore and i'm still playing it ....
I once played this game as a sunday morning coffee.
"&gt;Played a round with a friend &gt;We start off as allies, helping eachother out &gt;Turns out he's building a massive army behind my back &gt;I start seeing NPCs disappearing off the map &gt;'Cool, dude, we're gonna win!' &gt;'hehe, no' &gt;I see his army crossing a bridge into my territory &gt;'Oh ♥♥♥♥' &gt;Start mass-producing monks, as well as Pikemen &gt;Pikemen fend off his soldiers while my monks slowly convert his army, thereby creating more enemies for him to fight &gt;He has no idea what's going on &gt;'This is your religion now' &gt;I send his army back to destroy him and he has nothing &gt;Gg I win 10/10 would 'wololo' again"
Pretty good
"Love this game since my childhood.  This is an impressive feat for a real-time strategy game that came out over a decade ago, especially when you consider that the official multiplayer matchmaking service was shut down years ago."
Kock it up to nostalgia but this game in particular has always ben a favorite.
A great game that is infinitely replayable. Age of Empires is the greatest strategy series of all time!
Old but gold
Great Games. Love it
"Nostalgia ✓ Game play ✓ Replayable ✓  One of the first games I've ever played and I'm so damn thankful that it's surpased the test of time and advancements.  Don't let this game die out, Long Live AoE II ♥"
Ilove This Game It Is Realy Good Game (y)
Still the best RTS around after so many years! Now running on HD resolutions and 60fps.
It's AoE2...with Conquorers...what else is there to say?
Greatest startegy game ever made!!!!! No doubt about this!
Really fun when you get to know the game and you have friends
Great game to sit back and relax. enjoy it :)
"Nostalgic, still in love with this game!"
"I load up a custom map, play for an hour, and it turns out that there's no enemies on the map, because the default difficulty mode is set to 'easy.' So I load up a campaign, and realize that nothing happens, and I win from walking from one end of the map to the other (where's the empire-building?). I decide to flip to the next campaign, Joan of Arc, and the mission is exactly the same: walk from one end of the map to the other. Where's the castle-building? I'm tired of hearing old British and French accents try to make up for the lack of gameplay."
"I use to play this game when I was 8. Today I am 22, and I can still play this game, even with better grapic, much better MP compatibility and also with mod support!   There are also lots of new factions and campaigns.   Great game for its price.  Could be also played perfectly fine on older computers or laptops."
"It's a history teacher in a form of a ridiculously interesting yet fun game. Come on, who doesn't like games?"
Do I even need to review this? Everybody knows about this nostalgia.  Play it stragtically and train units that counters your enemy; play it to your own liking and swarm your rival; play it educationally with the campaign mode... JUST PLAY THIS GAME.
"Great strategic game, nostalgic as well, reinforcing 'old but gold'."
"First strategic i've ever played. Still in love with this game and it will never grow away from my childhood. i even remember the good ol days cheat codes 'Howdoyouturnthison' :,).. Aaahh memories"
"I remember playing this game when i was 10 years old. I had played it for 500+ hours before I even completed one mission storyline. But what I enjoyed is the athmosphere, the music, sounds and voice fluffs. Now when i look at it, it is amazing how much depth a game had for that time. Also, first time I saw what shelby cobra looks like."
"'Test of Time' nomination. The game is still great, and will continue to be so."
I have been playing this series since the first release of Age of Empires. Age of Empires II only further hooked me. I was playing this on the MSN Gaming Zone back in the days. I'm glad they released the DLCs to give us more civilizations to play to add a bit more fun to the game. This is a game that I have spent hours playing in huge 3v3 or 4v4 battles with friends. A game that I highly recommend to anyone that wants an all out battle royale.
5/7
This game is awesome and stands the test of time.
This is THE GAME that got me into the RTS genre. AOE II has stood the test of time and is still one of the best RTS games out there. With the new expansions and continued updates and developer support AOE II has never looked better! AOE II will always have a special place in my heart. The Campaigns are very interesting and has in fact taught me a lot about history too. A very good game all around. Highly recommended.
after all this time this game still holds a lot of value
"This game is freaking cool. Go buy it.  But don't play against bots, they're farming as hell"
"This game is the definition of RTS. Even to this day the mechanics are relevant and the updates it receives make the game feel like a new one.  There is not much that can be said about this MASTERPIECE that hasn't been said before. However, let's hope that between this 'HD Remasters' and Halo Wars 2, Age of Empires IV can become a reality."
"Just nominated this for the 'test of time award'. AOE 2 is my first ever RTS game when I first played it back in 1999 in Windows 98. . I was so happy when I first saw it comeback in the HD release and was on offer! This games reminds me of my childhood when I 'nolifed' this game! skipped entire nights countless times. Well I don't have luxury to do the same again, I do enjoy playing the new campaigns. I hope there will be more and more DLCs available for this game. It sucks you in and you forget the concept of time! Many young gamers might find it un-attractive and dated but I'm a fan!"
Classic game I've played on and off for years! If you like original RTS' try it out!
START THE GAME ALREADY
"One relic of old times, I still enjoy that one. interesting + great variety of possibilities.   Ps: Paladin = maybe the best unit :)"
"This game never gets old, I recommend it for anyone who hasn't tried it yet, it's still easily the best RTS game out there. I'm still waiting for AOE IV!"
"chiken always wins, never lose, chiken is love, chiken is lyfe"
Who would have thought fighting an AI could be this good?

Greatest RTS ever!
Still as epic as it used to be.
"Just nominated for 'Test of Time Award'. My favorite game on steam hands down. I have a couple thousand hours on the CD version and i play on voobly/Gameranger. The Graphics, resolutions, and DLCs all make it a great buy. I think the full price is worth it but if you've never played before you'll want to wait for a sale. Do yourself a favor and buy a classic."
Best. Game. Ever. Why are you not playing it?
10 out of 10 would save Joan of Arc again just to watch her die.
Japanese castle is made out of wood -&gt; not enough stone
"I Believe that is still one of the best, even better with the remastered"
"Well, what should I say? It's an all-time classic, never got old, never got boring. It's just great."
"It seems that even in the ancient times, dodge viper was rulling the world !  +1 would play it all over again"
"This is the game I nominated for the 'Test of Time' award. I suspect many others have done so as well. To my mind, that says much about just how seminal Age of Empires II has really become.  I've been playing this since it first came out, all the way back in 1999. I was 13 at the time, and I was into it like a junkie is into crank. Every minute I wasn't at school, or doing homework, I was on AoEII. Even at weekends, I'd get up at 6 in the morning just so I could play a few extra hours. I admit, that's partly just the kind of teenager I was, but I don't think there's many others games that could've had the same effect.  I don't play it nearly so much now, granted. It's been many years since I've become that obsessed about anything. But I do still keep coming back to it, maybe 2-3 times a year, and every time it feels like meeting up with an old friend. Again, it's probably the only game I can really say that about.  Later games in the series are perhaps a little more streamlined, or have more interesting features - the 'home city' system in AoEIII, in particular, is something that I really wish could be retro-fitted here - but AoEII still remains the high point, and I feel it always will. It has a sense of immersion that few other RTS games can match: with only the simplest production design, it really conjures up feelings of the forests of Olde England, or the deserts of the Crusader States, or the steppes of the Great Khans. I could go on and on in that regard, but I shall spare you any further gushings about medieval history. Save this: it was with this game that my fascination with the period really began.  And from a purely gameplay perspective...whilst, yes, the UI is a little crude compared to Mythology and AoEIII, it is still a masterpiece of efficiency in its own right. Even the most complex of civillisations are effortlessly controlled. If you lose a battle, it is because you made poor decisions, not because you struggled with the game over executing them. Getting that balance right - being simple and yet still challenging - is an achievement that does not really grow old.  So, for me, this is the game that has best stood the test of time. And if you are not convinced by my arguments, consider this: how many games get new DLC fifteen years after their first release? None but this one, that's how many."
Will be WAY better once TFT update rolls around
"This game was my first game on PS2. Yes, I played this game on console and I adored it since the very first moment. Since than I always followed the community and watched commentaries and streamed games. Now I've finally bought it HD and I really think it's still a solid game.  Test of time award? Hope so!  "
I love this one. You have my time.
Its AOE II....
Great Game that has stood the test of time.
108 hours in and i cant win a pvp match. Great game i just suck XD
One of the best RTS games to ever be made. Definitely a classic! The HD update makes a great game even better.
"For many players and myself this is an all-time classic real-time strategy game.   Pros: Excellent multiplayer balance - Each civilization has a balanced set of available technologies Depth - Many civilizations to play with unique bonuses and unique units Sound - Great music. All civilizations have unique unit voices for their respective languages. History - Become familiar with technologies and wartime  Graphics - For being made in 1999, the game has aged wonderously. HD Update - Full support for all HD resolutions. Smooth scrolling, 3d water effects, AA, V-Sync Replayability - Multiplayer is hundreds of hours of playing, learning, adapting, best with FRIENDS   Meh: Mild Learning Curve AI - AI is better than in original and can sometimes be a great challenge. But it can also be too good sometimes or do just plain stupid mistakes.  Cons: Graphics - 16bit game engine is limited so modding will only make it look so much better. Can't Zoom or rotate map Performance - Single-threaded performance bottleneck (CPUs with slow max core clock will suffer, if you're on a laptop make sure your fans are set to max and CPU performance set to max if you have that option)"
Bringing me back to the good old days! As good as the original one and even better because of the mods and extra content. One of the best RTS of all time.
This game and its prequel marked my beginning to PC gaming.
Had to nominate this game for the 'TEST OF TIME' award. I don't know if I'll ever get bored of this game.. It's a ton of fun to play with friends!!
"The First game I've paid on the Steam, good memories!!"
A game that contains a few heroes that use to command an army and lead them to success. Based on real stories. A perfect game if you're lazy enough to read the real history. As you play this game you will know more about them 1 by 1.
Still awesome.
"Anyone who loves RTS games should have (and almost certainly has) played this game by now. You don't get as much variation between races as, say, Starcraft, but all the races feel unique and have different playstyles. The campaigns are fun, the AI ranges from Childish to Skynet depending on how much of a beating you want to receive, and the soundtrack is surprisingly soothing (if a bit repetitive).  I am a bit biased towards this game because it was what got me into gaming, but it's still a great game! Sure, the graphics suck. Sure, the Aztec pikemen look just like the French pikemen. Sure, I usually just cheat in a couple dozen COBRAS and wipe my enemy out with superior firepower rather than playing the game properly. But dammit, this game was THE real-time strategy game back then! And by 'back then' I mean 'about 8 years ago when I was too young to buy games for myself'. These kids with their CODs and their Skyrims and their Fallouts don't know just how great games used to be! *shakes old man fist*  Seriously though, buy the game. It's old and the graphics aren't the best, but it's still one of the best RTSs ever."
WOLOLO SIMULATOR   10/10 would convert the HOLY LAND again
"Extremely good game, had a fun time reminising :)"
I play it since forever. The best game ever.
"I played this game a lot when I was 8 years old, and when I saw it on steam I was a bit sceptical. I thought I wouldn't enjoy the game as much as my younger self enjoyed the game, but I was totally wrong. This is without a doubt my favourite game on steam. Because there are so much civilisations there is so much diversity, meaning that this game never gets boring. This could be the only game that (in my opnion) is damn near perfect, so I give this game 5 stars. I you are looking for a great and fun game to play alone or online with others, I would totally recommend Age of Empires 2 HD."
  I remember when I was like ten years old and I had the cd version of this aoe2 and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Then it broke and the grass turned pink but I still liked it. Now I have gotten this HD version and the dlc's and the game are so great!
me: this game sucks  preist: WOOLOOLOO  me: this game is awesome
Still satisfying after all these years. Playing against friends on LAN Parties still rocks.  Test of Time definitely won!
What a fantastic game even after soooo many years
"Despite only having this game for a little bit, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing against friends. Really would recommend playing this against friends or others as it is so much fun setting siege on there undefended buildings and just blowing there ♥♥♥♥ up. 10/10 would play again."
"There was no better part of my childhood than booting up Windows XP and playing AOE2 until the sun went down, and the treatment this game has been given is nothing short of superb."
This game simply cant age.
Literally my childhood &amp; the beginning of my love for history.
"Nice game, strongly addicting skirmishes"
Will always be one of the best classics around!
Will be WAY better once TFT update rolls around

"One of the best classic RTS ever. Music, art, gamedesign is really good."
"it will stop being fun when the universe ends, the it will be slightly less fun"
rly dodgy but excellent fun
"Pretty good, reminding old times with this classic. Works fine on windows 7."
"Desynchs and random crashes aside, this game brings back some fond memories of when i didnt understand how this game worked when i was a youngin.."
As good as the first day i play it
This game is one of the best out there. Had the game when it first came out and played it till it broke. Had to get the steam version of it when I say it again. 10/10
"An incredible RTS with amazing scope, featuring numerous civilizations and campaigns from across the globe during Europe's Middle Ages. This game stood the test of time even before the new expansions came out."
"Stands the test of time, still as good now as 10 years ago."
"Still the height of RTS gaming!  Smoother animations and a nice uplift in textures, but still the same top notch game mechanics. If you're new to Age of Empires or real-time-strategy in general, there is no better game to play than this. The thrills and chills of bloody medevil combat without all that horse !@#$!  If you're part of the returning Ladies and Lords, the only thing you'll be miffed at when purchasing this is that they changed all the 'hotkeys!' But that is a small price to pay for new content to one of your favorite games! Take a look at the new Forgotten Expansion for AOE II HD!  Update: Lords and Ladies! Warriors and Scholars! There is still more to be had! Take a look at the African Kings expansion!"
AoE will always be a game I return to I have many fond memories from this franchise.
A really really good game. It stands the test of time.
"I saw that game is quite huge. I couldn't do much beginning and to learn all this stuff would take me hours and hours. So, that's why I make it short and leave the game for now with a positive review."
You can build a wall to keep the mexicans out... 10/10
"  Age of Empires II is strategy game. There are various civilization, in normal mode you start with 3 villagers and a town hall. Need gather resources, make an army, upgrades, strategy the battles, fight with team mates, play competitive, build your own map, play campaign.  I lost a good part of my childhood playing this. Of course i Recommend this.  ------------------ Good ------------------ Is realy fun the you play with a lot of friends no bugs (haven't yet found one) hd version competitive mode a lot of content in the workshop   ------------------- Bad ------------------- if you play a long time it gets boring(well at least for me)    "
Still the best strategy game ever.  
Surprisingly large amount of players
"I fell in love with this game at the very first day I played it, and to this day I still love playing it. There was no doubt that it was the 'Test of Time' winner for me.    P.S. I would really love if the bring LAN multiplayer back."
AoE 2 HD is what you know and love about old RTS because it is old RTS in higher resolution
Still as fun to play as when it first came out. You can always find a multiplayer game and the campaign is great.
This Game is just a Classic. It makes so much fun to play.  Also... Sheep Scouting!
"A strategy game from the year 1999 that is to this day one of the best games of all time. Also a great tool for learning about history. For someone who knows nothing about this game: you play as a certain civilization and try to defeat your enemy by building your city and gathering resources to build an army to fight with. But there's much more to it than that. Also, the game has kickass music."
"AoE II is one of the 'classic' RTS out there... it was a overall medium game until the expansions kicked in. The mechanics are common and understandable, but the games shines through its setting, and mostly through the different civilations in the game... In today standart some of them can not be counted as civilations anymore... they are just garbage... With the first expansion 'The Conquerors' Social Justices Warriors were really happy and excited, because the Mayans and Aztecs where added; the SJW gave the following statment: 'Yeah, finally some game devs stand up for the rights of the native americans and this is really good' But then the developers realized they ♥♥♥♥ed up, because AoE II main market is the surperior european market, and that a expansion with natives will not sell that good there. So they worked with all their manpower 247/ to add the Spanish in the game, before the expansion goes to the stores. They finished this task just in time, so the typical european can replay the history as a superior conquistador to get the gold from the natives... But then the developers got sued... but not by Social Justices Warriors like you expect... they got sued by the  progeny of Francisco Pizarro, the reason why they sued the devs was, that the game features the Aztecs, but not the Inca, so only Hernan Cortes gets his glory in the game and Pizarro is threaten UNFAIR, and this is not ok. So the devs said, ok lets make a another Expansion. So 'The Forgotten' was born and the Incas where added, even the Indians to make the Britsh players happy, so they could enslave the Indians once again. And the slavs in general where added so all slavs like the polish, russians, etc can live in peace together... But adding the Indians was a big mistake, the Spanish and the British were happy... But what a about the portugese? They got really envious and said; 'Devs add us in the game or we will make the same things with you like we did with the average african slave' The devs where so impressed by this statment that they added a new expansion, with the name 'The triangular trade', but the title got ♥♥♥♥ stormed by Social Justice Warriors, so they changed it to 'African Kingdoms', wich means pretty much the same. This Expansions added the Portugese (what a surpirse) and Malians and Ethopians. The portugese were so happy that they added these two african nations, so they send the devs 1millions euros, because now they can take the people from mali and sell them as slaves (ingame). Triangular trade is a 2016 now. History has just become real.  I highly recommed this game, so i rate it with slavery/10."
Yeah it's alright
It's ♥♥♥♥ing Age of Empires II... C'mon... Of course it's great!
and there's people in the world who say history is boring. if you think this game is boring then you are not my friend.
fun as hell
The game brings back loads of memories. I used to play this when I was in school and the new campaigns are although buggy but do add a lot more content to the game. Feels great to revisit my childhood.
"Great game, since it's launch."
Truly the Greatest RTS ever made.
"This game was my first game on PS2. Yes, I played this game on console and I adored it since the very first moment.

"An incredible RTS with amazing scope, featuring numerous civilizations and campaigns from across the globe during Europe's Middle Ages. This game stood the test of time even before the new expansions came out."
Only new to it. Very fun and rewarding.
Fun game. I play this game with my friends and its a blast. $20 is a bit steep but if its on sale you should get it. Pros -Fun with friends -Good strategy game Cons -Too old to be worth $20
Just as good now as it was a decade ago. Mods bring nostalgia to life in the best way.
A timeless classic.
"I had this game on a disc and I played it for almost two years. When I got a new PC with windows 10, the disc didn't work anymore, but I didn't hestitate to buy this game again on steam. The HD edition brings many bug fixes and is a very good game. Despite its age, Age of Empires is still a game worth playing."
Best feeling is upgrading to Imperial Age and you get to get the Halberdier and Condottiero while everyone has to use their Militia because they don't have necesarry gold and food.
"  The old AGE II reviewed. If you want to re-play this old glory, this is the version you should buy this version. There's alot of multiplayer games to play, and the single-player story to rewin.  Worth."
"THe best strategy game till date. There is so much built intot his game that it can never get old. My frinds play at least about 5-6 game in one session and believe m, a game is quite long in most cases. The multiplayer element is a constant bounty land while the single player campaigns are a crash course in history."
"Just as good as the old and even better. The multiplayer was while often getting kicked from the lobby annoying, still fun to be able to play more with other people. The AI has also been improved. If given a large amount of resources in a custom environment then they will be able to rush with paladins and trebuchets, meaning even if you have 10 castles producing teutonic knights and halberdiers everywhere then you'll still have a tough time!"
always a good time playing
Iz rily gud. PLZ gif me moni ty.
"Amazing classic RTS, one of the best games of its time and still holds weight as you might notice by the amount of people still playing it."
Awesome Game ! Both with Aoe 3 this is my favourite game ever ! :D
"It's one of the first strategy games i ever played and still one of my favorite. It's simple and realy fun to play.The only problem i have with it, is the lag in multiplayer otherwise it's great. Highly recommend it :)"
Literally my childhood &amp; the beginning of my love for history.
"Nice game, strongly addicting skirmishes"
Will always be one of the best classics around!
Will be WAY better once TFT update rolls around
"This game was my first game on PS2. Yes, I played this game on console and I adored it since the very first moment. Since than I always followed the community and watched commentaries and streamed games. Now I've finally bought it HD and I really think it's still a solid game.  Test of time award? Hope so!  "
I love this one. You have my time.
Its AOE II....
Great Game that has stood the test of time.
108 hours in and i cant win a pvp match. Great game i just suck XD
Regarding the 4.8 beta patch...just tried it! AND IM OVER THE MOON!!!!!!!!!!! thankyou thankyou thankyou! AOE 2 HD is playable now! didnt have any 'lag/desync' i had like 20 villagers all working on my screen and didnt foul up once! goodbye social life and hello highly defensible positions in blackforest!.........
"FORGET ABOUT THE TOWN CENTRE!!!!!! JUST KEEP THE LAST VILLAGER ALIVE(AND A BOAT), YOU CAN REBUILD YOUR KINGDOM. 20/10 VILLAGERS IS OVERPOWERED"
Awsome game of the decade
"If you are an old lover to the franchise of the AoE-series then this HD edition will feel perfect for you. Atleast when it comes to the multiplayer and playing standard game. Sadly it have much to look into, I have compared my original version to this and the maping of units are simply terrible. Have had tradecarts getting stuck in trees when they should go around and so forth. But that is mostly it for standard/multiplay.  The new Campaigns thought is just terrible, fantastic ideas but when you look on the maps and missions they leave much that the old ones have. If truly feels like someone have thrown something into the map editior and pulled it out noticing that half the content is missing. 'They won't notice' seems to be the reaction.  Even for those two crucial things, I am having a nostalgic trip that made me bring forth my old one for some fun comparison and to continue to play this, love it and hope that they will polish it a bit!"
Amazing gameplay for a game over 10 years old and any RTS player should have this in their library.
The game is fantastic.
10/10 would petard again
"A timeless classic, need I say more?"
"Great game. Although some of the new content does not quite mesh with the original content, AoE 2 is such an awesome game that those parts are easy to overlook. As someone who grew up on the Age of Empires and C&amp;C series, this is at the top of the list for RTS games. They don't make 'em like this anymore."
A classic game that still stands the test of time...
"It was great when i would go over to my friends house and do lan battles as a kid. Its still just as great as good as it was back then.  Btw, a full samurai army from the japanese is the most broken thing in the game"
"I'm a huge fan of the series, AoE2 is the standard for classic RTS's in my opinion. A great game."
Honestly so many memories were made with this game back in the day. I would spend hours after school playing this game. I totally recommened it to anyone who wants a blast from the past!
This game is STILL awesome!
"AOE2, one of the best real time strategy games of all time. Such nostalgia. Wololo!!! 10/10, but tricky AI balances too. I've recommended it for test of time award no bias... :D Because this was it back then, and it still stands up."
My favorite late 90's RTS game given HD textures. How could I not recommend this to others? Gotta get those badges
"Man, this game holds up so well, for RTS fan is a must buy and the HD edition only makes it better.  In summary BUY THIS GAME.  &gt;:D  The only drawback is that priests don't say 'wololo' anymore while converting units, i really miss that from Age 1 (moddrs pls T.T)"
Classic game. Basically the pinnacle of the RTS genre.
Still love using the animals in the catapults.
This game is one of the greatest and most fun strategy games ever! 
I nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' award.  Can you think of a game that is more timeless than this one? I certainly can't.
An awesome classic
"This game is definetly not for everyone and games can take a very long time but if you like rts games, then I highly suggest AOE:2"
I used to play this game as a kid and now I play it competively online. Such a fun game! The mins fly by!
"Voted most likely to have played during childhood!  Still holds up to this day as a great game especially with friends in a Game of thrones style diplomacy, the dlc is nice but I think the base game is fine.   Havn't really played much Mulitplayer but the few people I've played with are friendly and make multiplayer enjoyable."
"Good old AOE 2, play alot in childhood, play 42 hr in HD version. Still good playing even as of now. Very good RTS, there are some really well made guide on youtube. One of the best communities I think."
Wololo
"Always been a great game, now the HD update makes it even better. What's not to love?"
Honestly so many memories were made with this game back in the day. I would spend hours after school playing this game. I totally recommened it to anyone who wants a blast from the past!
This game is STILL awesome!

Classic game. Basically the pinnacle of the RTS genre.
Timeless game! Remember playing this when I was younger and recently just started playing again. Love playing with friends.
Its a very good game however I am pretty new to it.
This is an awesome game. I remember playing the old version. This is all that and more!
This game is a peice of my child hood in game form. Love this game. multi-player is still very active. Hours of fun! Please PM me for more information!
"Age of Empires II is one of those games that withstand the wraith of time. Keeping up with new content and updates even today this game is one of the classic Jewels.  An incredible balance between units with a great variety of civilizations, each with there own bonuses, unique units and arquitecture, and a pretty interesting and mostly historically accurate campaign for you to enjoy. This game is definitely worth and it can surprise you all the hidden bonuses to exploit."
"Excellent game that stands the test of time, one of the best RTS ever. Throughout the years no game quite managed to have the essence (and nostalgia factor) that AOE 2 has. Recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it (yes, there are some who haven't)."
10/10 Just like the old one but with the new civs and stuff
anyone else remember getting AoE in the cereal boxes as kids?
Just play it. Like right now
Fantastic game that has stood the test of time! Well worth the money.
"The golden olden from an age gone by, among the best LAN games there was back when internet made dubstep noises.  "
Childhood 10/10
"Having liked the Age of Empires series as a kid, I really enjoyed this sense of nostalgia by playing this hd collection. It is an overall wonderful game for those whole like a great strategy game to play by yourself or with friends! Easily 10/10 !!!!!!"
"One of humanity's greatest achievements, now in HD!"
"I saw that game is quite huge. I couldn't do much beginning and to learn all this stuff would take me hours and hours. So, that's why I make it short and leave the game for now with a positive review."
You can build a wall to keep the mexicans out... 10/10
"  Age of Empires II is strategy game. There are various civilization, in normal mode you start with 3 villagers and a town hall. Need gather resources, make an army, upgrades, strategy the battles, fight with team mates, play competitive, build your own map, play campaign.  I lost a good part of my childhood playing this. Of course i Recommend this.  ------------------ Good ------------------ Is realy fun the you play with a lot of friends no bugs (haven't yet found one) hd version competitive mode a lot of content in the workshop   ------------------- Bad ------------------- if you play a long time it gets boring(well at least for me)    "
Still the best strategy game ever.  
Surprisingly large amount of players
"I fell in love with this game at the very first day I played it, and to this day I still love playing it. There was no doubt that it was the 'Test of Time' winner for me.    P.S. I would really love if the bring LAN multiplayer back."
"Extremely good game, had a fun time reminising :)"
What a fantastic game even after soooo many years
Still satisfying after all these years. Playing against friends on LAN Parties still rocks.  Test of Time definitely won!
So much nostalgia from this game
"Oh man, how do I start this review?   Age of Empires II"
30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30
"Whoever have nostalgic moments when playing this game, knows how I feel right now :3 "
"Old but gold, a strategy classic."
"I played this game a lot when I was 8 years old, and when I saw it on steam I was a bit sceptical. I thought I wouldn't enjoy the game as much as my younger self enjoyed the game, but I was totally wrong. This is without a doubt my favourite game on steam. Because there are so much civilisations there is so much diversity, meaning that this game never gets boring. This could be the only game that (in my opnion) is damn near perfect, so I give this game 5 stars. I you are looking for a great and fun game to play alone or online with others, I would totally recommend Age of Empires 2 HD."
Nostalgia HD with added content
"over many years, this is still a good game"
Can confirm this game has passed the test of time.
"This survives the test of time, love it."
"A timeless classic. Simple mechanics, but a huge amount of depth.  HD remake isn't overly HD, but it enables it to work on new systems, and to play easily with Steam friends. Worth it on special."
Classics never get old
Can't wait for the sequel!   /s
Playing this is High School is why i do construction for a living now. :( How the Mighty have fallen...
"It's a timeless, classic game :')"
7 years later and I'm still playing this game
"I'm not much into strategy games, but AoE has been one of my favorites for many many years. I never get tired of playing it."
Fun game. I play this game with my friends and its a blast. $20 is a bit steep but if its on sale you should get it. Pros -Fun with friends -Good strategy game Cons -Too old to be worth $20
Just as good now as it was a decade ago. Mods bring nostalgia to life in the best way.
Only new to it. Very fun and rewarding.
Just as good as the day I first bought it on CD
It's as great as it always was
"loved this game since 2000, now I'm back to the childhood :))"
Wish have Official Chinese Support
Old classic which is definitely worth picking up during a sale.
Never gets old. And The DLCs are also a great addition to it. I recommend buying them on sale. I'm giving this a TEST OF TIME award. I will always enjoy playing it.
"If i have to select one game for my entire lifetime just one and no other, it would be Age of Empires 2. I first started to play it when i was 8 years old. Now im 27 and i still play it. Best game i have ever played."
Still holds up to this day!
"An awesome upgrade from the first AoE, that I consider to be the best game ever. AoE 2 stepped up a knotch and still remains one of the most amusing game to date. Buy that s*** bro!"
this is my favorite out of the age on empires games and was the game that got me into RTS games. picked it for the test of time reward for this one will last longer then any of the other age of empire games
As fun as the day I bought the original!!
"As incredibly good as the day it first launched many years ago. The new civilizations, tweaks and revalances are really nice too. And best of all, it works great in new computers and modern screens!"
This brought back memories. Good and well refine game. I just wish the first DLC has voice acting.

the one and only strategy game that I will truly remember
"This game never gets old. 10/10, would crush my enemies before me again."
It's AoE II! Enough said
This was the first game i ever played on pc when i was 6 years old im 21 now and i still love playing the game
"Still the best RTS of all time, especially if you prefer single player or coop. Includes rare and fun features like wall building and random maps!"
The good ol' days
"The king of classic RTS experiences, back in the days when MSN Gaming Zone was a thing, and sending hotkeyed taunts via multiplayer chat was just soooo far ouuut, man. Terrific range of civilisations, each with their own unique abilities. Bright and pretty game world with a lovely colour palette makes for a fun multiplayer or single player experience. Whether you fancy yourself a Yuri, Rogan, Mandatum or Chopper, AOE 2 is a timeless treasure of realtime strategy fun.  The HD Edition elevates this masterpiece to Certified Platinum level, with a beaut range of enhancements and a great buffet of mods available via the Steam Workshop. 10/10 will always Wolololololololololo again"
Very nice! Old but gold with new hd graphic.
"A classic in the strategy genre, still to this day I play it and in truth a game that I’ve played over the course of 17 years, is simply mind blowing, and of all the games I have ever played this one always get reinstalled onto a new PC before any other game, if that doesn’t tell you everything then nothing will, the HD update with expansion packs just makes it a little sweeter."
This game brought me some good old memories. Its still a great ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and now even in hd with dlc! &lt;333
Amazing game! Been playing it since it came out.
What a game!
Some things just NEVER get old.
Just 'The best ever'. Love it
workshop makes everything easy Balanced Regular patches  what is The People asking for?
A timeless classic.
"I had this game on a disc and I played it for almost two years. When I got a new PC with windows 10, the disc didn't work anymore, but I didn't hestitate to buy this game again on steam. The HD edition brings many bug fixes and is a very good game. Despite its age, Age of Empires is still a game worth playing."
"Years later, and I still keep coming back to play this game. Granted, within an hour I'm bringing out the stone throwing sports car to decimate the attacking hordes, but never mind that now."
Just came back for playing this game at a LAN party with my friends. It never gets old.
"I'm not much into strategy games, but AoE has been one of my favorites for many many years. I never get tired of playing it."
Fun game. I play this game with my friends and its a blast. $20 is a bit steep but if its on sale you should get it. Pros -Fun with friends -Good strategy game Cons -Too old to be worth $20

My favorite late 90's RTS game given HD textures. How could I not recommend this to others? Gotta get those badges
"Man, this game holds up so well, for RTS fan is a must buy and the HD edition only makes it better.  In summary BUY THIS GAME.  &gt;:D  The only drawback is that priests don't say 'wololo' anymore while converting units, i really miss that from Age 1 (moddrs pls T.T)"
Classic game. Basically the pinnacle of the RTS genre.
Timeless game! Remember playing this when I was younger and recently just started playing again. Love playing with friends.
Its a very good game however I am pretty new to it.
'What age are you in?!'
"AoE will be nominated and most likely win the test of time awards, it's amazing in many ways and It's something old but enjoyable. Definitely reccomended to any RTS fan."
"HD is just a HD version, but The Forgotten expansion is received with gratitude :) All hail AoE  P.S. Definitely the best use of farm animals! 8)"
A timeless classic from the golden days of RTS' It's just a shame they removed the ability to destroy trees with siege.
"The game that never stops giving, Age of Empires II is probably Ensemble Studios' most remembered venture, and thanks to some weird chances it has been given a new lease on life through an HD port with better performance.  In it's simplicity it reveals how games have evolved during the last 16 years, specially a once popular genre such as Real Time Strategy. With a compelling campaign that seemed to never end, it offered plenty of playtime through a robust scenario editor and frantic skirmish battles, without mentioning the possibility for online play, which has been properly realized through the Steam rerelease despite the clunky code that lies behind it, another showcase of how far games have come in terms of multiplayer.  I'll probably sink a few more hours into this, listening endlessly to the signature warhorn and trying my best to hotkey my way to victory."
"A classic? No, this is THE Classic."
Just nominated this for the test of time award.  Classic RTS. Still as much fun as I remember.
Still good after all this time.
Best RTS I've ever played. Lots of nostalgia from this game.
It's my favorite real-time strategy game. How much time I spent with it!
"Timeless, endless age of empires 2.  This game has truely stood the test of time being as much fun today as it was the day it came out. The ' HD-Remaster' does not get in the way of nostalgia but instead does a good job of making it a little bit easier on the eyes that have become used to at least 1920x1080 at 60fps.  Bought the original game when i came out, lost the disk, bough 'HD' version on steam, never regretted it. 9/10"
A great classic this game was my childhood
"HD EDITION means that you can play in hd or full hd resolution. Graphics are the same. Most of the problems are the same. C'mon, it's AoE2. If you play, you play, the rest is irrelevant."
"If they would add sea walls, and moats this game would finally be complete and the best RTS game ever made."
For the acheivement
its a classic so check it out
Such a great game! Spent days and days and days playing this game before steam was a thing.
"Age of Empires II is definitely one of those games you just keep coming back to. Despite its age, it’s one of the best strategy games I have played. This game stands as testament that you don´t need fancy graphics to have some fun. It truly is a game that stands the test of time."
one of the best games ever made
10/10 would scout the whole map with sheep again
"'tis just for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ badge, but great game (y)"
Old but awesome! :3  
"Tis a fun game, played it on and off for about 8 years (since 2008)"
"Pretty good, i guess."
Nostalgia and childhood memories.
Very good old school game.
Probably the only RTS i'll ever actually use hotkeys in and i'm 100% okay with that.
Childehood game beforer the internet was big. where you played really slow maybe with your dad together. than you found teh internet where you could beat all the people yoou know. years later you just get dominated by all the people online and you see that there is just as much action as in a starcraft game.
Timeless classic! Even better in HD on modern hardware.
"Good old classic game, love it."
This is definitely one of the best strategy games. IM DUMB
"Same as before, but better looking."
"The game of my youth, enjoyed playing it. Amazing strategy, this game is a real classic!"
"Do I need to praise this game even more? Played it since I was 5 years old, 3 years after it got launched back in '97. Great game for the 'Best use of a farm animal' award, that's all I can add to this jewel, heh :)"
A masterpiece This gem never gets old  10/10 would buy again
"17 years on, and this classic is still one of the best RTS games available!"
I never be too old for playing this game!
This game is still amazing even today with all the shiney graphics and overcomplicated game design. AOE is still one of the kings in the RTS Genre.
A Beautiful game that stood the test of time...
Old but gold
"It's Age of Empires 2, Still the same but working on a new generation of pc... GET IT!"
"I greatly enjoy this game, and I think it should belong in anyone's Steam library. This game is a classic now.  I played this game before it was remastered, and it is still a great game. I refrain from saying 'it is the great game it was in the past,' mostly because they have fixed and added to the game. In my opinion, it is greater than it once was.  Plus, it has a Steam Workshop."
Nothing beats a decade old tradition of fighting back Aztec monks with Welsh bamboo.
"Well... you dont have to buy it.  YOU NEED TO DO IT  This game is a classic of classics, its pretty good to spend some time when bored, or to play with friends or even random people online.  You can also make your own scenarios and post them to the workshop!  You NEED to play this."
Awesome classic
Are there better RTS's out there? Probably.  Are there RTS's out there with more nostalgia? No!
old classic. Now we can play online without dread of lag or the need of a lan party!
"It's a classic, it's fun, it's got community support, and theres still new expansions.  Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it already."
One of the best classic games available on steam.
A great game thats always fun to come back to. Its one of the must play games when you get together with your old highschool buddies at LAN parties.
the greatest RTS game I have ever seen
One of the best games i know! Really having fun playing with my friends. Rocks. The HD version is really OP!
It is very good. 1v1 me. I'll rekt u with my conquistadores.
Such a great game! Spent days and days and days playing this game before steam was a thing.
"Age of Empires II is definitely one of those games you just keep coming back to. Despite its age, it’s one of the best strategy games I have played. This game stands as testament that you don´t need fancy graphics to have some fun. It truly is a game that stands the test of time."
It stands the test of time.
"Loved this game 15 years ago, and still love it today. Very few games keep that kind of replayability."
"One of the best games ever, imo."
"I have played this game occasionally since the late 90s. It was my first RTS game and I loved it ever since. The graphics are timeless, the controls are simple, the strategies are endless, and online gameplay is smooth. This HD Remake comes with more civilizations, maps, upgrades, and increased population limits. Definitely worth the price."
9/10
"'old', but still great game"
Old but gold :)
"Although its quite old already, its still one of the best RTS games."
"The first and the best! Nostalgic strategy game, with excellent solo play and even more fun with multiplayer."
yes. buy. play. even gooder than original release. 
"one of the best game , I just nominated for the test of time award"
10 years later and 'How do you turn this on' still cracks me up
"Best game ever made. Nowhere else can you learn history and remove Saracen kebab at the same time. Just reading the fluff in the manual carried me easily through all my secondary school history classes. 10/10, don't forget to lock your villagers in or those filthy traitors will open the gates to a horde of paladins."
A classic RTS. Strongly recommended for strategy fans.
One of my most favorite games of all Time!!!!!!!
This game should beat Goat Simulator in the nomination for 'Best Use of A Farm Animal'
Undying and classic strategy game!
What they did with the HD edition is great. It's a simple refresh to a timeless classic.
"Just a classic and good game here, you can't get better."
30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30
"Whoever have nostalgic moments when playing this game, knows how I feel right now :3 "
I play it since forever. The best game ever.
This is a game that will never grow old. LONG LIVE THE MAMELUKES!
"One of the best games i have ever played. Had it when i was younger and loved just messing around on it, but now i am older and fully understand how to play it i find is entertaining to play.  A must have game!!"
"I played this with friends a lot when I was a kid. This revamp makes multiplayer much easier, and introduces this masterpiece to the next generation. It was especially nostalgic considering I still remember all the cheats and they still work."
Classic!
while my play time says 10.2 hrs i have played AoE 2 for years  i still have original disks for Age of EMPIERS 1 it's xpack Rise of Rome and Age of Empiers 2 ;Age of Kings and it's xpack The Conquerors and have lost hours to them all i really hope the Age of Empiers 1 comes to steam as well with an HD upgrade
Old games still the best
"The goto game to waste a hour or two, or three..."
me: this game sucks  preist: WOOLOOLOO  me: this game is awesome
"Just nominated this game for the'Best use of a farm animal' award, cos if using a sheep as a scout isn't the best use of a farm animal then i don't know what is!!  Used to play this game loads back in the day so ignore my measly hours played. Would highly recommend"
will always be great
One of the greatest RTS games ever made
All time classic. Nothing to add.
Keep calm and Wololo.
The best strategy game i've ever played
"The 'remake' sucks and could have been so much better. Every patch brings its own new problems, like really severe game-breaking bugs, and I don't know if it's sloppy work or the terribly old engine. The only reason why I still wholeheartedly recommend this game to any minor strategy fan is the flawless gameplay design which, almost 20 years after the initial release, can motivate you for hundreds and hundreds of hours. Multiplayer is pretty crowded and you'll always find a game, also there are fun singleplayer campaigns waiting for you, although the presentation is a bit outdated."
"One of my favourites and now even on Steam so you can mod the game or collect trading cards or simply play with or against your friends. I definitely recommend you play this game (sandbox mode is far more awesome than the singleplayer story which is quite educating actually). Also, this is a classic!"
After coming out in 1999 it is still one of the greats and now even better with HD.
AOE2 HD is still the best strategy game. The new contens are good as well. Must Have!
pretty good
My friends are now my slaves
"This game is a classic. Redone in HD graphics it is nicer to look at on the screen even if the lag issues still persist in multiplayer. The expansions add extra races and a lot of extra hours of play to this timeless game. Had loads of fun playing it when it came out and then spent loads more playing it now. If you like building walled cities, managing large armies and annhilating your foes, this is the game for you!"
"Spent like 80% of my time age 10-12 playing this game, it's pretty cool. Cool Steam port yo"
This is one of them games that stood the test of time and still is as good as the first time you played it.
"You don't like this game? Wololo, you like it now. AoE II is simply the best RTS ever. Nothing better than converting an entire army of Persian Elephants, or building a wonder on the same spot where you razed the enemy base to the ground.  "
5/5
the best rts
Still like to play it
"Best game ever made. Nowhere else can you learn history and remove Saracen kebab at the same time. Just reading the fluff in the manual carried me easily through all my secondary school history classes. 10/10, don't forget to lock your villagers in or those filthy traitors will open the gates to a horde of paladins."
loved this game since i played it as a kid
"  This game is literally crack. You'll be HOOKED on this game all night, and it would be almost 5AM. That's what happened to me.  Get it. It's a worthy classic. The Community is great, the game is fun, so many new strategies, and surprised from your opponents."
A must have game!
This is the game i used to play when i was a kid. I'm not a kid anymore and i'm still playing it ....
still playing...
"Nominated for best use of farm animal award. I mean, a sheep than can explore a map for an empire is pretty impressive, right?"
This is one of my favorite games ever my first game i ever owned and the game i will always own definietly worth all the money
"One of the greatest RTS games of all time. Never grows old, I was ever so glad when they released the HD version. I used to play the orignal Age of Empires 2 Age of Kings + The Conquerors like crazy when I was younger.  In addition to that, I love the fact that a lot of what I know about history was learnt through this game (or motivated to look into because of this game). XD  A definite go-to for any fan of RTS genre or someone looking to explore it."
Spent too many hours on this game using cheats as a kid and now don't know how to play properly. 10/10.
Start game. Type '8'. Repeat.  10/10. Would be your king again.
"I nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' award.  I first bought Age of Empires II when I was about 10 years old. I had saved up my allowance and some birthday money, and my mom drove me to Circuit City to plonk down $48.99 for the CD-ROM (I got the Gold Edition that came with both AoE II and The Conquerors.) I'm almost 26 now, and I still play this game regularly.   AoE II is RTS perfected. The different maps and civilizations allow for plenty of different strategy styles, but the gameplay remains simple and very streamlined, and is still superior (in my opinion, at least) to AoE III and Age of Mythology. The game has even held up visually as well (thought I do appreciate some of the improvements made in the HD edition.) Simply put, Age of Empires II is a timeless classic, and if you're a fan of the RTS genre and somehow haven't played it yet, you really should."
This is the game i used to play when i was a kid. I'm not a kid anymore and i'm still playing it ....
"Nominated for best use of farm animal award. I mean, a sheep than can explore a map for an empire is pretty impressive, right?"
Still one of the best RTS games I have ever played.
"Good old classic game, love it."
This is definitely one of the best strategy games. IM DUMB
"Same as before, but better looking."
It is still alive!
"Just nominated for the 'Test Of Time' award, one of the greatest game from my childhood!"
"When I was younger I liked playing this game, but because I never had any cd or other ways to play it when I got older then I couldn't play it, so I was happy to see that it not only became possible to buy and play through Steam, but also in HD quality. And it does show the HD when and where it needs to, at least for me. But I honestly don't pay too much attention to the graphic, because all I want to do is play this fantastic game! My childhood in one game, love it, and won't part with it. If you played this game as a child and feel nostalgic, or just want to play a great RTS, give this a try. :)"
"Classic game. Excellent historical campaigns, who doesn't want to El Cid or Joan of Arc?"
"gud but still prefer the beta from 1998, bak in the goledn dayz"
"This is the game you remember from your childhood. If you're not sure whether it lives up to your memories, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. There have been some graphic updates, bug fixes and even new expansions for this steam version (I wouldn't say expansions were neccessary, but are very welcome nontheless!).  If you are one of the few that didn't play this... well, what are you waiting for? AoEII is the best real time strategy game made. Great fun as a single player or multiplayer. There is one lingering problem with it - it's pretty easy to sink a lot of time into it.  10/10 would reccommend"
"It was good then, it's good now."
Still one of the best RTS games.
Just as good as before. Only problem is it has the same issues as before. Still love it though.
Incredible game that's fun to play every now and then. This is one of those games that never gets old.
10 years later and 'How do you turn this on' still cracks me up
"Best game ever made. Nowhere else can you learn history and remove Saracen kebab at the same time. Just reading the fluff in the manual carried me easily through all my secondary school history classes. 10/10, don't forget to lock your villagers in or those filthy traitors will open the gates to a horde of paladins."
A classic RTS. Strongly recommended for strategy fans.
One of my most favorite games of all Time!!!!!!!
This game should beat Goat Simulator in the nomination for 'Best Use of A Farm Animal'
Undying and classic strategy game!
What they did with the HD edition is great. It's a simple refresh to a timeless classic.
This is one of my favorite games ever my first game i ever owned and the game i will always own definietly worth all the money
I once played this game as a sunday morning coffee.
Brings back the memories while ruining friendships
I grew up on this game and love it dearly. Awesome RTS.
still playing...
11
Will play this game for the rest of my life if I had to!!
"A classic RTS, updated in just the right ways: adding proper widescreen support, very minor graphical upgrades, and Steam Workshop support, along with two new expansion packs.  My only complaint is that the dev team sometimes takes a very long time to fix known issues with the game. Restoring of multiplayer games remained totally broken for a long time, until they released the Patch 4.8 Beta tjhat fixed the issue."
"I played this game quite a bit when I was younger. Still just as fun now, except people actually know how to play and kill you immediately after the 30 minute treaty you set finishes."
"Love this game since my childhood.  This is an impressive feat for a real-time strategy game that came out over a decade ago, especially when you consider that the official multiplayer matchmaking service was shut down years ago."
The fact that people still play tgis game is proof enough how awesome it is. I couldn't wait to play this game on my 1500eur rig.
Probably one of the best medieval strategy games that I've ever played
"bi far 7he bes7 game i've plaied in a long 7ime, brings me back 7o 7he golden age of s7ra7egi games. (keiboard is broken... never said i was ani good a7 7his game x)"
5/5 game for every couchgeneral
"Best game. Although the original works better, multiplayer is easy to set up though."
Quality game.
What's a better use of a Farm Animal than to explore the map?
I grew up on this game and love it dearly. Awesome RTS.
This game was my childhood and is just as good as I remember. Wololol
After coming out in 1999 it is still one of the greats and now even better with HD.
AOE2 HD is still the best strategy game. The new contens are good as well. Must Have!
pretty good
My friends are now my slaves
"This game is a classic. Redone in HD graphics it is nicer to look at on the screen even if the lag issues still persist in multiplayer. The expansions add extra races and a lot of extra hours of play to this timeless game. Had loads of fun playing it when it came out and then spent loads more playing it now. If you like building walled cities, managing large armies and annhilating your foes, this is the game for you!"
"Spent like 80% of my time age 10-12 playing this game, it's pretty cool. Cool Steam port yo"
This is one of them games that stood the test of time and still is as good as the first time you played it.
"You don't like this game? Wololo, you like it now. AoE II is simply the best RTS ever. Nothing better than converting an entire army of Persian Elephants, or building a wonder on the same spot where you razed the enemy base to the ground.  "
5/5
"Classics and one of the best RTS ever, this remastered version is worthit"
"My favourite game of all time, here on steam in an HD edition. Been playing this since it originally came out in 1999 and will never get bored of it. Probably logged a few thousand hours in this game before the HD edition released."
This game has stood and will continue to stand the test of time. Every time I boot this game up I'm blasted back to middle school and even then it was old. This game has a special place in my heart as I poured many of my childhood hours into the original. Pick this up if you are feeling sentimental over AOEII or if you just miss the RTS genre in general.  #bringbackgoodrts2k16
It's an iconic game that everyone should at least have the chance to play
"AoE2 is an excellent RTS that still holds up years after release asking for a strong mix of strategic resource management, in-battle tactical decision making, and quick reactions from the player. Even years after its initial release, this game has a huge amount of depth, while still retaining an intuitive surface level that does not leave new/casual players feeling lost. The HD addition still has some networking problem, but the DLCs fix a lot of the bugs and UI issues from the games original release and add a number of interesting civilizations into the mix. Overall, an amazing game and a staple for any RTS fans."
"Timeless classic. They've done a fantastic job bringing Age of Empires 2 into the current era. It was enough of a graphics and engine haul to deserve a remake, runs smoothly and the additonal extra's through DLC and game content have been a welcomed edition.  If you loved the original, then this is a must have."
Never get older.. There's no to say... Respect.
"An absolute masterpiece. I have played this game since i was a kid, and with the remaster it showed itself again on an (somewhat) better form."
Nominated AoE II for The “Test of Time” Award. Great game I still play to this day.
"Strats of the world, conquest or search and destroy ¨*"
"Can't say much about this game. I've played AoE since the original CD release back in the late 90's. Today the way I see it, it hasn't aged a bit. On the one hand, the HD version adds new content, but on the other hand it introduces new bugs. It's far from flawless but it's getting nearer with the latest patch. It's a classic nevertheless that many of us enjoy playing even after all these years."
"Age of Empires II is as good now as it was years ago! I remember playing this game when I was young so I thought 'Whatever, it's on special, might as well have a go again.' I wasn't expecting to still be able to play it for hours on end like I used to but, spoiler alert! I can. AOE is great to play with friends or single player.  Great game, 10/10 would Wololo again."
Really good real time strat game.
One of the best games ever made

Classic Real Time Strategy Game. Age of Empires 2 is a game I still play with friends today. After revisiting it recently I imagine I'll still be playing it with friends for a long time to come.
Old but gold
Childehood game beforer the internet was big. where you played really slow maybe with your dad together. than you found teh internet where you could beat all the people yoou know. years later you just get dominated by all the people online and you see that there is just as much action as in a starcraft game.
Probably the only RTS i'll ever actually use hotkeys in and i'm 100% okay with that.
"An aboslute classic RTS game, I still remember buying the whole box set of AoE 1+2 and the expansions on CD back in the day.. I didn't do anything else but play.. Got the cool tech tree booklets with it and planned out strategies with my school buddies. Ohh.. the memories!  These days, it may be a little dated, graphics wise but the gameplay is still unmatched.  "
"I remember watching one of my family members playing this as a child and I was had extreme wounder for it... Sadly during that time it was around 2000 or something like that and I was about 7 years old. Now, thanks to the powers of the beautiful internet and the fantastic devs we now have it for Steam. I might not be very good even against a normal AI but this game is great and I love it. Single-player also? I'll be better at that tbh. This was the first RTS I've seen in a long time that gets me coming back now and then.  Test of time for sure.  ... Dem some op Monks though."
"Well, if you played the classic version pick this one, its really wonderfull that such an old game still have an online comunity"
I love this game since early 2000's this game make me hero..but than one monk come and convert me..K
"Nominated for the Test of Time award 2016 - I first played this in 2000 as a demo, and the HD verrsion makes it a lot nicer to play today."
Most people will nominate it for test of time award! It is still the king of RTS games.
"I've nominated this game for the 'The Test of Time Award'. Since its release in 1999 (2000 for 'The Conquerors Expansion') it has been one of my most favorite games to go to. I've spent countless hours playing the (original) campaigns, numerous of random maps and a lot of user-created scenarios and campaigns, and I'll happily continue to do so with this HD re-release of the original classic.   Both the DLC packs 'The Forgotten' and 'The African Kingdoms' are worth it too and are a very nice addition to the original game.  Be aware though, that playing this game in multiplayer can be laggy. Patches (trying) to resolve this (and other bugs) are coming out on an irregular base (the latest patch as of writing is 4.8 beta).  All in all, I do recommend this game."
good game and brings back heaps of memories
"Really cool RTS game, even after 20 years its fun to play,   first plaed in 1999 and still playing in 2016 . Cheers to the great game."
I love old games like this one 10/10
14... 14... 14...
"A gem from the past, this RTS has aged quite well. This game proves that you don't need flashy graphics or fancy animations. Just good game design and a dedicated player base."
This Game is So Awesome! Age of Empires II You got to get this game!
Picked this game up 10+ years ago having never heard of AoE before. I ended up nearly flunking 8th grade.  10/10 would lock self in room for 6 hours a night doing 'homework' again.
"Originally released in the 20th century, and people still want to play it... Yes, it's a good game (if you don't mind old school sprites and UI)."
"Age of Empires II was one of my favourite games growing up and I put so many hours into it. To have an HD re-release was the best news for me. A perfect point and click strategy game that incorporates different cultures, teaching you along the way. I'd highly recommend it to any gamer; I'm not a fan of strategy games but I love this a lot."
"Played it back in '99 when it released and still play it today, definitely a game that deserves the 'Test of Time' award."
Great RTS
"Played it back in '99 when it released and still play it today, definitely a game that deserves the 'Test of Time' award."
Great RTS
THE GAME BRING SOME NICE MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD !! WHY I'M YELLING I DON'T KNOW!     'not worth the full price' ¯\_(ツ)_/¯       
I hate these damn priests  wololo/10
It's simply old but gold.
Really good game :v
This game is lit xD! KidsRunTh3World!!!
"Do i really need to say,why this games is best!?"
This is absolute RTS ever!
Old but Gold  
"Before steam I played this to death. If you like old school good solid strategy rts, then this is the game for you. Big thumbs up and in my subjective nostalgic opinion... 10/10. Gameplay, music, graphics... mmmmmmh!"
Nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' award since this is one of my most favourite games of all time to play together. This game will never be not fun even after all this time.
"One of the best RTSes of all time, even today."
It is still alive!
"Just nominated for the 'Test Of Time' award, one of the greatest game from my childhood!"

"Loved this game for a long time, even now it stands the test of time for me."
Still one of my favorite games of all time!!!
"Do you really need to read a review of this game? I mean, it's Age of Empires II, this game has aged as well as Jennifer Aniston. Just buy it."
"Loved this game ever since it was AoEII: Age of Kings 1.0c....and for that I nominated it for the 'stands the test of time' award  If you have any love for quick paced third person medievel combat strategy games, then you've probably already heard of this game. Age of Empires II remastered in HD is beautiful as well as challenging. You can play the 5 campaigns, the frantic random map game, or even a hellish death match with AIs or other steam players. After grasping the simple mechanics of using villagers to grow your economy and your troops to destroy those of others, it becomes a game of strategy to defeat your opponent. Ultimately you'll find how essential the raids and sieges of the real era was. There are some historical discrepencies, but what do you expect when it's games of Huns fighting Mayans?  Unfortuanatly, the game doesn't feel complete without The Forgotten DLC causing you to likely shell out some more, but the fact that it is quite cheap when it periodically goes on sale at 30% to 75% off keeps it from being a burden. It also will need a higher power computer to run some of the better features.  All in all, Age of Empires II HD is a great strategy game for any player to own.  EDIT: The new African Kingdoms DLC is really for hardcore fans, and the update/patch that came along with it is enough. Good addition and an easy pickup during sales, but definitely not necessary."
I used to watch my dad play AoE/AoE2 all the time when I was younger so this is rather nostalgic. It's a top tier game and you should all play it&lt;3
Nostalgia is that you?
Who would have thought fighting an AI could be this good?
"Why are the Celts fighting the Mongolians in Texas? Why does a Teutonic Knight have more health than a house? Why can a monk change the political beliefs of an elephant, a seige catapult and a ♥♥♥♥ing sawmill? It doesn't matter. Few games allow such a scale of war crimes to be committed against your friends, and fewer still capture the actual horror of having your peaceful farming village ransacked by a regiment of Viking Beserkers revealing themselves out of nowhere. One of the best games ever created and more than worth the price. (Its like 2 bucks oin ♥♥♥) (Sorry Steam)."
"This is the game that made me a gamer. If i have more than a 1000 games in all plataforms, this is the one responsable, age I start, age II confirmed."
I have never loved farming so much !
The magnum opus and pinnacle of the RTS genre. Depth of gameplay holds up today.
made 2 towers fight eachother 10/10
"Very good game even though it is very old. I can play this for hours on end, absolutely timeless"
Helped me pass my history exam. 10/10 would play before exam.
Best game ever! 10 out of 10
"17 years on, and this classic is still one of the best RTS games available!"
love this game get it for the mods
"A classic and an absolute must-have for all strategy gamers. Didn't experience any downsides in gameplay with the HD version, comparing to the original AOE II. On the contrary, the HD graphics as well as a smoother scrolling of the game screen make this version a great purchase.  Having played loads of different strategy classics such as Command &amp; Conquer, Civilization, XCOM and others, AOE II is still one of my favourites."
what can i say. Strategy games were never my forte but this particularly one had bring me very good times playing it.
"The date: Christmas of the year 2000   I was just turning into a teenger when I had my very first PC (Compaq Presario), been a console player all my life before that (oh those golden Nintendo days). But man, Ensemble Studios arrived into my life to change it all.  I played this game to death, I just don't know how many hours I put into it through the years. In those times I had a pc but no internet, so I loved it when I could sleep in a cousin's house and spend from dusk to dawn playing his copy on MSN: Gaming Zone. In school we had a little group of friends making LAN parties and played this game for hours. We even had a clan started by me called 'The Shadow Clan' and got into some great torunaments (never won, but hell what a fight we used to put). Arch Koven was our master (some of the most hardened AoE2 oldschoolers might know his name, Korean Legend). Those were the days...  The years passed, and like a lot of things in life, this game aswell but always remianed in my heart.  Until recently, I completely turned to PC and said goodbye and my thanks to consoles for their service to me, and started to build up my Steam Library. I was very happy when I saw this game here and of course, I had to buy it, hell I even bought it for some friends and my wife because I just couldn't pay enough for all the joy this game gave me back in the day.   So this more than a review is a short story, really, this game does not need a review, Age of Empires 2 has already proved the world what it is and what it has to offer, you don't need to read a review to buy it, just do it.   It is a gem that will last through the ages and remain in your heart, just like the empires within the game, just like Flavius Aetius, the last Roman."
Still like to play it
One of the best games ever.
"Ageless classic, now with more expansions!"
"I can't bellive, this game is 15 years old and still one of my favorite!"
Amazing with lots of updates
The good old Age!! So many memories!! Thanks for the HD version!!
"If I could give a neutral review if possible, but not reccomending the game would be too harsh as this game is incredible ONCE YOU GET IT WORKING. I spent hours last night modifying games file sto get this to work on my machine. Not very good for people who are not well aquainted with stuff like that.   However, provided that your game runs fine on your machine, this game is great."
"The best RTS hands down. A classic that will never die, no matter how many years go by. This game is why I got into gaming froma young age. So much nostalgia and is still fun to play even today. No RTS title in my opinion has been able to surpass AOE. 10/10 wololooo"
"This game is the ♥♥♥♥. It's old as ♥♥♥♥, like older than Dinosaurs, but it's still mean as ♥♥♥♥. The graphics are now hardcore HD. So basically the same but work on my ♥♥♥♥ing huge monitor. Who needs that ♥♥♥♥ though cause the gameplay is better than sex, anal sex. Get this ♥♥♥♥, then play MP. Good ♥♥♥♥. Mad hardcore props to this sick ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ game. Mad."
"I absolutely love this game.  It is the first videogame I have ever played, and I still do sometimes. It is a marvelous strategy masterpiece that stood well the test of time.   However, WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING TO MY GAME?  BRINGING OUT EXPANSION PACKS AFTER 16 YEARS, AND TRYING TO TURN AOE 2 INTO THE NEW COD WITH ALL THAT DLC AND REBALANCING?  NO. I WON'T HAVE IT.   SOME THINGS SHOULD NEVER CHANGE FROM THEIR PERFECTION."
"Great classic!  Pro's - Good balance - Lot's of civilizations to choose from.  - Mediumly paced gamespeed (therefor the game is more about strategy and less about clicks/min) - Easy to learn, hard to master. - Still being updated in the same spirit as the original game - Historical campaigns :)  Con's - Graphics are a bit outdated (does help with the nostalgia though ;) ) - Pathfinding of the units is a bit clunky at times - A few civ's are slightly overpowered compared to the rest (e.g. Chinese, Italians)  Al in all I think AoEII HD is a great classic and a solid RTS title. It is a bit old and therefor has some flaws, but fun for young, old, die-hard RTS'er and for the casual gamer."
"Absolutely awesome game. Recommended for all RTS fans of all ages. This is the standard and it (probably) still hasn't been beaten!  I've nominated this game for the Test of Time Award as I'm still playing it, and it's over 20 years old! I don't know a better contender."
14... 14... 14...
"A gem from the past, this RTS has aged quite well. This game proves that you don't need flashy graphics or fancy animations. Just good game design and a dedicated player base."
This Game is So Awesome! Age of Empires II You got to get this game!
Picked this game up 10+ years ago having never heard of AoE before. I ended up nearly flunking 8th grade.  10/10 would lock self in room for 6 hours a night doing 'homework' again.

"Played it back in '99 when it released and still play it today, definitely a game that deserves the 'Test of Time' award."
This is the greatest RTS out there. Pure nostalgia.
Same gameplay with great grafics. 
"  Monks and sheeps; what could possibly go wrong? Right, no WOOLOLO..."
Childhood in one game.
"A simple update to a classic game, giving a whole new group of people the opportunity to experience one of the greatest Real Time Strategy games to ever be made."
Still 1 of the best strategy games around ;) never gets old
"Old, but Gold"
"I'm glad that this was the first strategic game I have played, it's just awesome :D  Totally recommend"
A single man can repopulate the whole world Halbedier can kill a castle tree = stone buildings  10/10 would paint wood to stone again
"A great game for killing time. Playing a skirmish type game against 1 pc controlled race could have you sinking hours into it. Aoe II: HD Edition may be a bit tricky to get the hang of especially if you don't really play many RTS style games but it's really a trial and error, and every single time you lose a match you end up switching your strategy to prevent that from happening again. It's all really something you have to learn. When you do eventually get better and get all the timing down (like when to attack, or advance to a new age), leading a conquest can be pretty fun and gets addictive!"
I don't think I would've ever been into RTS games if it weren't for Age of Empires II.
"'Recommend' is putting it mildly. Between the expansions, the workshop, and AoK Heaven, there is nearly an endless amount of content and a great quantity of it is of extremely high quality and originality.  Put simply: I have enjoyed every single hour I've put into this game, and regret none of them. This game scores a 6.0 on a 4.0 grade scale.  Warning: Certain studies suggest this game may cause (social) life threatening conditions. You may see a sharp rise in your electric bill. This game is known to the state of California to cause Vitamin-D deficiency. Some players experience sudden and uncontrollable outbursts of rage while playing Age of Empires. Age of Empires may cause habit-forming use of caffeine. If, while on this game, you forget to sleep more than twice a week, contact a chiropractor as it is likely you have developed carpal tunnel. You shoud not play Age of Empires if you have a job, attend school, or frequently interact with friends. Players with a history trebuchet addiction should not play Age of Empires, as it may increase the likelihood of abuse. If you are experiencing strategic difficulties, you may be elligible for YouTube-assistance.   Contact the Steam Store today  to see if Age of Empires is right for you  because there isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Age of Empires is not for you."
"Induces a Middle School Nostalgia Coma of LAN parties, disc swapping, cobra cars, and pounding the ground to build castles.  11/10"
Anyone else remember the MSN days? then Gamespy? Times were good...
Words cannot express how much I love this game.   My favorite real time strategy game ever.
The “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award  Sheep Scouts - Just sayin'
"  I played the original Age of Empires II endlessly as a child. Seeing it remastered is an absolute joy, and it hasn't lost any of its allure. It's a great RTS with enough difficulty to be challenging, but with a fairly easy learning curve that doesn't leave you scratching your head as to how to keep things going right. The addition of updated multiplayer for Steam seals the deal: for the first time I can play with another human being easily, and it's glorious, medieval fun. I received this game as a gift on Steam but owned the original on CD back in the day. Nothing gameplay-wise has changed."
Still the best RTS around!
"The ultimate game of my childhood. Hours of gaming years ago (original version), and still a whole lot of fun today."
"'ALL HAIL, KING OF THE LOSERS'  Cant beat this classic, runs on any compyter and runs well. Has everything you could want out of a RTS"
New AK/AoF campaigns are a great addition to a classic RTS. Multiplayer has issues that are currently being patched out but otherwise works well.
"Really love this game, played it as a child glad to see it again on steam"
Pros: -Balanced -Fun -Amazing  Cons: -No support for higher resolutions
Classic game. One of the best games from my childhood!!!
another gem from the late 90's... they don't make them like this anymore...  the somewhat relaxed pace and not too many options to overwhelm makes this game a still 'good for winding down' sessions...  the HD edition adds to an already excellent game and steam workshop makes it even more exciting...
"Although my hours on the HD Edition are very low, let me assure you I have about 400 hours on the original game, the Conquerors expansion, and The Forgotten Empire before it became an official expansion.  My friends and I are all in our 20s and we still have giant LAN parties throughout the year where we all drag our computers to a central friend's house. As we pass around our game disks to start the game, we connect to our 2 or 3 routers with 200 feet of Ethernet cable. There are computers all through the house, in the kitchen, the living room, and the bedrooms. Waiting for everyone to join the game, the lobby is full of in-game taunts: 'Quit touching me!' 'No' 'Quit touching me!' 'No' 'Yes' 'Smite me!' 'Raiding party!' 'Sure, blame it on your ISP' 'All hail, king of the losers' 'Wololo' 'Quit touching me!' 'No'  Now, the games begin. We play Regicide for 8-10 hours in a knockout tournament style. As we battle in 2 vs. 2 battles we drink enough Mountain Dew and Monster to stay awake for a month and enough junk food to give a herd of elephants diabetes, until only two teams are left. The rest of us either start playing matches or spectate the final battle that decides the winner. The final in-game taunt of the night is 'You played 2 hours to die like this!?'  Your experience will be similar when playing multiplayer.   This game is a blast to play, either solo or with friends, although it's more enjoyable when you can look into your friend's eyes as their king falls to the ground, dead. I highly recommend buying this game with the Forgotten Empire pack when it's on sale for $5. Heck, go buy the original game from Walmart for $10 and get your friends hooked with a LAN party, you'll have great memories for years to come.  That being said, the HD edition is only slightly different graphically from the original. The textures have been updated and the game now supports a wide selection of monitor resolutions compared to the original 3 settings. The best part of the HD upgrade in the Steam Workshop, lot's of cool stuff in there.  The only downside, and I mean the only, is the server lag. It can be pretty bad but compared to how awesome this game is it's a minor inconvenience.  Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 8/10 Audio: 9/10 'Quit touching me!' 'No': 9000/9000"
Modded this game so my ranged units rained sheep down upon my foes.  Covered the map with the corpses of my projectiles and my enemies.  10/10 would mod again
Childhood in HD
  nice game part of my childhood
10/10
"Classic, simply said. Surprisingly, all the games of the series are great."
One of the greatest RTS ever made.  Build wall around city. Build wall around wall. Then watch them catch fire when hit with a sword.   10/10
Killing kings is the dream!
"I grew up with this game. I remember playing it for hours on my old cadode screen. I had much fun. I am pleased to play it again. I lake some precious skills but with some perseverance I'm sure I can be a Yololo master.  The two new expensions bring some freshness to the game and are well welcomed. Also, they balanced the game and make some improvement.  One of this good old strategic game that we wish to see again."
"I spent loads of hours on this game way before it was avaliable on Steam, I even had a copy of this on PS2 before the HD release.  Overall 10/10 Epic! Worth buying!"
Old game but still one of a kind! i'd recommend this game to anyone!
"Game of my childhood. Spent countless hours on this back in the day, don't regret a single minute."
AoE II still sets the bar for RTS's... just fantastic
great game!
"For many, this is about nostalgia, but I feel this game does indeed hold up as one of the grestest (and still great) RTS ever made. Amazing to think new content being made for AOEII, the fact that people still love this game, and presumably new fans as well..."
Banter Multiplayer *Includes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ feudal and dark age rushes* Sick mods Just good ♥♥♥♥
Rush 'em till you bust 'em 10/10  Edit: 11/10 swords catch houses on fire
Wololo...  YOU NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR: THE “TEST OF TIME” AWARD
I will play this game forever
"Still a great game. Stands the test of time, with slight improvements."
I challenge every single one of you to pick a better game for Timeless Classic!
"The most satisfying historical RTS I've played, with a savory balance of economy building, history and military strategy. In all honesty, neither one of these categories is extremely realistic or accurate, but to me it makes for greater playability and gratification this way.  UPDATE: 2 years later, the game has a new mod and is still great. This game will never go out of fashion!"
Childhood amaze! very nice. much play...for real tho...played the ♥♥♥♥ outta this game when iwas young! Worth the buy!!
Wololo
"It is a little gem. Granted, it is not up to par with some new releases, and the path finding still drives you nuts every now and then. However, it has a nicely balanced tech tree that is varied enough while still able to feel manageable, and the scripted campaign (especially for the Conquerors) hold up surprisingly well.  Come for the nostalgia, stay for the scout cavalry rushes."
"a true classic, a top10 game for me... all the rts gameplay of the original in an updated packaging... a huge world of campaigns to explore together with workshop support... outstanding!  .......EDIT In view of the rajas dlc, i decided to add to my review, hoping that someone from the devs will pick it up and consider my suggestions for subsequent expansions: -look into civs from other eras, eg. from the original AoE I, like the Romans, Egyptians, Greeks, or subsets thereof, eg. the Spartans, Alexander's Macedonians etc. -look into civs from the AoE III, like the American indian tribes etc. -look into subsets of civs already included, eg. the Ninjas (off the japanese) or the Shaolin (off the chinese) , the Knights Templar, Knights of Saint John etc.  many thanks"
Best game i played as a kid. Love it!!!!!!!!
"This game is a must have for evreyone who enjoys building up a small village into a massive empire. Thanks to 500 cap population you can hold huge battles consisiting of Infantry, Calvary, and Archery units. With multiple gamemodes, a stunning campaign and a diverse( all skill levels) online community you'll never be bored. You should defintely get this game."
"gotta love the 'black forest' map. other than that, the best strategy game i have ever played... ever"
"Very few games can better the game-play of AoE2, it is an old game with new support and updates, and a VERY high skill ceiling which makes online play fantastic. Huge variety and huge number of single player campaigns. One of my all-time favorites."
Has been around for 17 years and is such a great game I would not be shocked if its around another 17.
"I only recommend this because it's Age of Empires at its core. The single player campaign still can't hold hold a candle to the base game...am i the only one that cares about the quality of the campaign? In any case, the writting is bland, the voice acting is TERRIBLE, no music plays in the background when the story is delivered making it that much more awkward.   Some of the campaigns are creative like The Mountain Seige (Le Loi) but otherwise most of them are just boring. I also have a problem with the difficulty in this game (like with The African Kingdoms DLC). It seems like the higher the difficulty, the more 'free resources' the opponents get. When I look at the enemy's economy I don't see how this guy is swamping me with high level units with only that may workers. IT'S CHEATING!!! If I were to harass the enemy workers, distrupt trade routes, destroy a towncentre or two it wouldn't affect them in the least! So much for strategy.  Also archers, skirmishers, and most infantry are still useless compared to cavalry. I would only bother with archers if they did not cost GOLD! I'd rather spend gold on cavalry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S :D! To conclude this review, MAKE AOE4 ALREADY!"
"New Review: They fixed it. Thanks! Great game.   Old Review: Broken by second latest patch, and latest patch didn't fix. Game won't launch multiplayer, which basically breaks it."
Reminds me of the days when we had to have LAN parties to play this multiplayer.
"If any game is going to win the Test of Time award, it's going to be this piece of gold. Nostalgia at its best. This game is still my favorite strategy game to date, and playing it gives a nice dose of nostalgia too. I was very happy to saw that this got an HD remake, and I'm happy with the way they did it. They didn't change the gameplay at all, just upgraded everything around it. A true masterpiece like this is hard to find."
"I've had tons of fun in this game, mostly playing against people at LAN's. It's my favorite strategy game right now. ''About to lose? No, send villagers to each corner of the map.''  Old but gold."
All Time Great
Game of my childhood
"Old, but epic RTS."
"one of the best remakes of a game i have ever encountered, with a few added mods it is a force to be reckoned with"
"This game, will have been playing for 10 year. Nice RTS."
best Strategy game of all time
The good old Age!! So many memories!! Thanks for the HD version!!
"If I could give a neutral review if possible, but not reccomending the game would be too harsh as this game is incredible ONCE YOU GET IT WORKING. I spent hours last night modifying games file sto get this to work on my machine. Not very good for people who are not well aquainted with stuff like that.   However, provided that your game runs fine on your machine, this game is great."
"The best RTS hands down. A classic that will never die, no matter how many years go by. This game is why I got into gaming froma young age. So much nostalgia and is still fun to play even today. No RTS title in my opinion has been able to surpass AOE. 10/10 wololooo"
"This game is the ♥♥♥♥. It's old as ♥♥♥♥, like older than Dinosaurs, but it's still mean as ♥♥♥♥. The graphics are now hardcore HD. So basically the same but work on my ♥♥♥♥ing huge monitor. Who needs that ♥♥♥♥ though cause the gameplay is better than sex, anal sex. Get this ♥♥♥♥, then play MP. Good ♥♥♥♥. Mad hardcore props to this sick ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ game. Mad."
"I absolutely love this game.  It is the first videogame I have ever played, and I still do sometimes. It is a marvelous strategy masterpiece that stood well the test of time.   However, WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING TO MY GAME?  BRINGING OUT EXPANSION PACKS AFTER 16 YEARS, AND TRYING TO TURN AOE 2 INTO THE NEW COD WITH ALL THAT DLC AND REBALANCING?  NO. I WON'T HAVE IT.   SOME THINGS SHOULD NEVER CHANGE FROM THEIR PERFECTION."
"Great classic!  Pro's - Good balance - Lot's of civilizations to choose from.  - Mediumly paced gamespeed (therefor the game is more about strategy and less about clicks/min) - Easy to learn, hard to master. - Still being updated in the same spirit as the original game - Historical campaigns :)  Con's - Graphics are a bit outdated (does help with the nostalgia though ;) ) - Pathfinding of the units is a bit clunky at times - A few civ's are slightly overpowered compared to the rest (e.g. Chinese, Italians)  Al in all I think AoEII HD is a great classic and a solid RTS title. It is a bit old and therefor has some flaws, but fun for young, old, die-hard RTS'er and for the casual gamer."
Steam just updated and I lost my game progress. Help! I need a way to recover it.
"Really nice , Love this classical game, Still finde a lot of players in multiplayer  What i dont like is somewhat steap price .. 10$ for expasion whit a shot campain and 3-4 new nations ...."
"One of the best RTS games for me for all time. Played it when I was a kid because my cousin was playing. After that... well here we are. The game is superb in every way. Still trying to complete the missions though.. Lol.   Overall, I'd say its a great game to pass time and learn of history. Sort of. Lol."
It's amazing and it will always be amazing.. from the times I was just a kid playin' it till now
"This game holds a special place in my heart. It was one of the first games I ever played..  The updated version of this game fixes several of the problems the original game had. Most notably the PITA it was to get it to work on current OS versions.  I've also yet to see the texture issue that would see the grass laced with pink.  Overall, the game is the same. So, if you have it and feeling nostalgic. Pick it up!  PS: Here's to hoping for a remake of the original, Age of Empires....**** you lions for eating my workers! :|"
Best software microsoft ever published.  Btw: They are lying. The AI is still the same.
Great game that is timeless !
Childhood game that came out the same year I was born. Still amazing in every way.
"My favorite fo the franchise. I easily have over 500 hours playing this, when I include back when it first came out, and I still enjoy playing it all these years later."
"Its THE BEST GAME EVER i have also played aoe 3 and both of them is the best games that i have ever played especially in my childhood. ONE THING, PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL"
"Everything great about Age of Empires 2... but now in HD! Classic RTS game that has me on a real nostalgia trip, so I may be biased."
I'll probably still play this when I'm 90!
"Doesn't matter how many years this game was released, it is still amazing. One of the bests RTS ever made, not even its own sequels could beat it. Simple mechanics and heavy metagame, leading to a competitive and fun multiplayer, that will stand still for a good time."
"Age of Empires 2; one of the most iconic games from the late 90's and a must play on every lan party is now (mostly) playable on newer OS's ? A thought I found highly enjoyable, since I've played thousands of hours on the original steamless version released about 17 years ago; right to the point when did no longer work properly through changing the system from XP to 7. Soundbugs and purple water were just a few of the problems making it unbearable to play. Hearing that it would actually get an hd adaptation fixing incompatibility bugs filled my heart with joy. I bought it right upon release and gave it a few hours of gameplay and I must say its kinda good but not the same.   First of all, they fixed most of the bugs, which is ofc a huge step and raised the AI's ability to actually play kinda well. In the original release, a 1 vs 7 match on the highest difficulty was just like shooting fish in a barrel and many players jused it as a warm up for multiplayer matches. Through the workshop you now can still patch the difficulty even higher, which brings some sort of challenge even to the most veteran players. Target finding is still like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey on crack trying to run backwards trough a maze of broken glass bottles - the units still get stuck anywhere at anytime and won't hesitate to take the most stupid and unsafe route possible. Always watch where your folks are goint to.  Some gamechanges regarding the old one were made too. For example the maximum limit of units on all sides has been raised from up to 200 to up to 500, which is quite nice since you can comandeer way bigger and complexer formations of troops while sill maintaing your ressource gain trough your workers. No more sacrificing to make room. That change, I like.  Sadly, the game feels kind of heavy and bulky. Meaning with to much movement (which you'll get quite fast) on the map, it starts to lag. And not just a bit, it will get completely unplayable even in matches with only 3 to 4 people especially if your playing with AI's. I play on a fx8350 8x4,4ghz, 32gb ram with a gtx970 gaming and I still had to guit dozens of matches against just 3 or less AI players because as soon as i'm acually moving my 400+ soldiers into battle and the enemy does the same, your frames per second will become frames per minute. Online, its even worse. The few rounds I tried to play with my girlfriend vs AI, we had to leave after around 10 minutes because the lag was unbearable. A problem which is still there, even nearly three years after the release of this version. The old version never had those kind of problems with lag and we've always played with 8 players (human and/or AI).  So if you can, play the old version. Try a virtual machine with XP or W98 or something like that. If you want big battles with many units then this version is not for you. I will do the same since after three years, a patch fixing those problems is rather unlikely."
Such a good game.  Still one of the best out there
Great game from my childhood.
It is trully a classic. Many good memories.
THe RTS to rule them all. It never gets old.
"Age of Epires was my first game, and i loved it and this game only builds up what i loved from the game and made it even better!  It can be a little on the old side but the HD upgrade makes it runnable/suitable for High resolution monitors :)"
The game that really defines the Test Of Time
"I absolutely love this game, even after all the bugs and glitches the developers keep adding. I have to say, this game manages to hit home on the things that make a rts great. Age of Empires is without a shadow of a doubt the best rts available on the market right now."
"By far, the best game amongst many. I will always come back to AoE II and it never disappoints me!"
One of my favorite games ever...
This is the greatest RTS out there. Pure nostalgia.
Same gameplay with great grafics. 
"  Monks and sheeps; what could possibly go wrong? Right, no WOOLOLO..."
Childhood in one game.
"A simple update to a classic game, giving a whole new group of people the opportunity to experience one of the greatest Real Time Strategy games to ever be made."
This game will never get old!
swag money boi
"What can i say, an ageless classic here. If you liked AoE before you will like the HD version with updated graphics,AI,balance and supported constantly with new dlc. If you dont know what AoE is, shame on you.But if you are into rock,paper,scissors games with multiple variables,eco management or generally good strategy you will like this ,a lot."
One of the first games I have ever played. Still love playing this game.
Has aged incredibly well with a good graphics update. Still one of the best RTS ever made.
"Its one of those games u played 10 years ago and when you come back to playing it all over again and in hd graphics you feel like the world is a different place!! Great game, would be amzing if they made another expansion for this and also tried to bring vobbly aoe2 and this ao2hd comunity closer together! AOE2 is life and AOE3 :)  P.S Its a must buy game, graphics is not everything, but gameplay is........."
Back then it was a great game.....and it still is!
Probaly one of the best games I have ever played. The game play held up pretty good and now with (somewhat) improved graphics its better than ever. If you were a fan of the old one you MUST buy the HD edition. If you are a fan of strategy games and you haven't played AoE2 what have you been waiting for?  
42 :-)
Amazing game! Been playing it since it came out.
"Age of Empires is an amazing game - originally released in 1999 and still going strong! I love the new expansions, and that there are still updates being released. I know some people find the multiplayer laggy and unreliable, but this hasn't been my experience. My biggest complaint is that because my screen is high res, everything appears pretty tiny, and I can't figure out a way to adjust the resolution. But still a 10/10 from me"
"It will not only entertain you in both single player and multi player, but teach you about history of the different cultures present in this game. A must have"
In my opinion this game should win the nomination for its engaging and fast paced gameplay. It really gives the player a chance to really strategize their base for suprises for their enemy who may be lurking in that fog of war ( LOL).This game is an ultimate classic and always will be.
Had to nominate this game for the 'TEST OF TIME' award. I don't know if I'll ever get bored of this game.. It's a ton of fun to play with friends!!
This game is real old but gold.
One of the best RTS out there that has really endured the test of time. 9/10
A classic game updated to fix and balance out some old issues but still just as amazing and fun as it was when I was a kid.
Just nominated this for the test of time award.  Classic RTS. Still as much fun as I remember.
It's my favorite real-time strategy game. How much time I spent with it!
"Timeless, endless age of empires 2.  This game has truely stood the test of time being as much fun today as it was the day it came out. The ' HD-Remaster' does not get in the way of nostalgia but instead does a good job of making it a little bit easier on the eyes that have become used to at least 1920x1080 at 60fps.  Bought the original game when i came out, lost the disk, bough 'HD' version on steam, never regretted it. 9/10"
"A classic? No, this is THE Classic."
9/10
Nominated for the 'Test of Time' award  WOLOLO!
Old but gold :)
"Although its quite old already, its still one of the best RTS games."
"it will stop being fun when the universe ends, the it will be slightly less fun"
"An incredible RTS with amazing scope, featuring numerous civilizations and campaigns from across the globe during Europe's Middle Ages. This game stood the test of time even before the new expansions came out."
rly dodgy but excellent fun
This game wont get old ...
"Years later, and I still keep coming back to play this game. Granted, within an hour I'm bringing out the stone throwing sports car to decimate the attacking hordes, but never mind that now."
Nothing really needs to add to such positive reviews.  I have been played this game even before Steam was online. This game is so epic. Good thing that they release the HD version and its following DLC.
10/10 Realistic Farming
"If you haven't played this at least once, you're wasting your life"
Great classic! Looks good even in 2016
"For many, this is about nostalgia, but I feel this game does indeed hold up as one of the grestest (and still great) RTS ever made. Amazing to think new content being made for AOEII, the fact that people still love this game, and presumably new fans as well..."
Banter Multiplayer *Includes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ feudal and dark age rushes* Sick mods Just good ♥♥♥♥
Rush 'em till you bust 'em 10/10  Edit: 11/10 swords catch houses on fire
A 'remaster' of a rts classic that does the original justice in every way.
Who knew this game could get more beautiful!!! Even more mods... still getting even better!
"Easy to learn, hard to master. Very enjoyable and it could put you in intense situations. Enemy Wonder has 5 years left and you manage to destroy it while your Trebuchets are being fired at by Elite Cannon Galleons, you keep rebuilding more but there is no place to hide them at. Wonder goes down and you take a breath of relief, but wait, there are more enemies, they haven't given up yet, prepare to get attacked, use what you can, defend yourself, prepare for counter-offensive and at the end defeat those villains! The feeling you get when you come back from a very dark place and you win it all in the very end. Never give up. This game is a classic, doesn't matter if you micro Elite Mangudai or you spam Goth Huskarls, you just get so much joy out of it. Would recommend it to anyone who likes Strategy Games. Cheers, lads!"
"After all these years, still the best stategy game out there in my opinion."
Still standing the test of time
  thought an elephant balancing on a ball was an unreal trick? Watch 20 elephants fit on a ship comfortably and stay afloat.
"This is one of my childhood games. It holds a special place in my heart and it warms me so much to see it's community still being alive. As an adult I can cherish the campaigns in a new and different light, something I could not as a young child since my native language was not English. I barely understood the game mechanics back then.  As for a game, it has stood the test of time, the game holds deep and interesting mechanics and it can be easy for newcomers to get into but once you hit a certain threshold on the skill level, my god it will be punishing to lose a single second.  It's an amazing game that has some of the deepest roots of all the game franchises. This version does need some tweaking but the devs are doing a decent job att pumping out new content, just wish they could focus more on known issues with the ai.  Overall, it's a really good game."
A classic that is truly to be adored. Highly recommended.
 Classics never die
A timeless classic still thriving from a dedicated community.
Great game. Love the tactics needed and can be as fast paced as you want it to be.
"Probably one of the best rts games ever made, still holds up after 18 years"
"Iv'e played this game as a child, and i am happy to be playing it now. It brings back memories, and as of now, it is helping me create more."
"Dont let my hours foul you, this was probably one of the first RTS games I ever played. The saying 'old but gold' truly applies to this title. A not to complex but no means simple or easy. Even better, still they have provided more content as of late bringing older player like myself back with Rise of the Raja's and Forgotten Kingdoms. If their was a title worthy of your time and you haven't already played a real time strategy Id recommend this one.  If you have ever played the first Starcraft this is roughly the same kind of game and similar graphics. Gather resources build an army and take out everyone else. Many maps to choose from and almost never the same map twice, numerous scenarios and campaigns... you will find yourself playing this over and over.  9.5/10"
"This game is an old classic, but don't think that just because it is old, it lacks the technology to be fun! If you like a fun strategy game where you can build up your economy and amass an army to take over the world than this is the one for you. Granted the maps aren't anything too impressive, but its simplicity and competitive plays make it all worth it. (update): new maps are added to the old ones with every dlc.  And not that the Forgotten, African, and rise of the rajas expansions have come out, new civilizations have changed up strategies for an even handed gameplay.  If campaign is what you look for, Age of Empires has that too, including a training 'campaign' so you can learn the ropes of the game before jumping into it. There is also a place where you can test battle scenarios, create your own campaign, or test/practice battle tactics.  Age of Empires allows epic multiplayers so you can ally or fight competitively with your friends. One of my favorite pastimes is to ally with friends and battle it out with bots.  Highly reccomeded!"
Iz rily gud. PLZ gif me moni ty.
"Age of Empires 2 is a true classic strategy game, and I have been playing it since it came out! It still packs a punch in terms of storyline and difficulty."
Ah the good ol' days! The HD edition ensures the old game can take advantage of the large monitors of today which is good. Wish they'd create a revamp but the AOE3 attempt was not the same game really and the additions were a distraction.
very nice gameplay ... much fun to play with friends
Yeah it's pretty good. The net code has been improved and the game is still getting patches. Can't wait for the new DLC as well.
Still an AWESOME game
"  The old AGE II reviewed. If you want to re-play this old glory, this is the version you should buy this version. There's alot of multiplayer games to play, and the single-player story to rewin.  Worth."
"I am not a big fan of randomized map generation, which limits my multiplayer fun, but it's always enjoyable to try new strategies against the AI. It's not a game I play for hours upon hours, but come back regularly; playing different civilizations and trying out different strategies. There is always something I find interesting.  Age of Empires II is one of the few games that stands the test of time."
"A classic. Gotta love the nostalgia! There are still some bugs, but devs are actively producing new patches. Also recommend checking out the DLC's with loads of new civs. Campaign isn't as great, but the DLC's do bring a lot of new variety to the table because you have to come up with new strats."
Still good
The Best game EVER
Best RTS of my childhood. Voted this game for a steam award :D Wololo  
"This game is awesome. The only thing I don't like is the best way of optimising your skills is being faster to the miliseconds, which shouldn't be a strategy game's core aspect."
Incredible game. Easily deserves the test of time award!
"Nominated for 'Test of Time' award. This game is as fun and enjoyable with friends as it was in 1999. Don't hestiate, just buy it!"
Still one of the best RTS games out there with alot of depth and multiplayer never gets old. Great value for money.
Pro:  higher resolution so I can see what's going on standard game is still fun options to speed up the game are great  Con:  campaigns still don't interest me
"I have played this game since I was nine. I hope to play it until I'm ninety. (Well, maybe the AoE 2 HyperHD Spacetime Bending Holocron Edition or whatever may come till then.)"
Wolowolowolowolo........... *Enemy stole your car unit -- get rekt
Always comming back to this game no madder how old it gets.
You need to play this game if you wanna be a decent human being.
"After all these years, this game still holds itself strong with it's HD remake.  Age of Empires II HD consists of the old Age Of Kings and The Conquerors. Both having good campaings, accesability to player to AI battles (with new updated AI, which is a very big improvement. And you still have the possibility to change it to the very old AI) and multiplayer in the Originals department (which is considered Age Of Kings and Conquerors).  It also has cool DLC with balance changes, extra campaings, etc. which are worth checking out."
Please add better data mod support.
Still the best strategy game out there!
Old but gold
It's nice to see one of the games of my childhood get a second chance. It's a really fun game to play!
Wololo:Unquestionable word of god
A great game that has withstood the test of time. Still one of my favorite RTS games (if not my favorite of all time). Highly recommend it. A great way to learn some history through the campaigns. The community maps make the game even better too.
"One of the best games ever, imo."
"I have played this game occasionally since the late 90s. It was my first RTS game and I loved it ever since. The graphics are timeless, the controls are simple, the strategies are endless, and online gameplay is smooth. This HD Remake comes with more civilizations, maps, upgrades, and increased population limits. Definitely worth the price."
The legend.
"It aint starcraft, but it aint to bad."
This is the ultimate 'old but gold' game ever.
The Best game EVER
Best RTS of my childhood. Voted this game for a steam award :D Wololo  
"This game is awesome. The only thing I don't like is the best way of optimising your skills is being faster to the miliseconds, which shouldn't be a strategy game's core aspect."
Incredible game. Easily deserves the test of time award!
"Nominated for 'Test of Time' award. This game is as fun and enjoyable with friends as it was in 1999. Don't hestiate, just buy it!"
"Pretty well made remake, though I'd like to see some 2k / 4k support as the menues are tiny playing in high res"
It is alright. Can reccommend if you wish to play a real RTS. Online matches are quite fun!
Family and friends have spent hours playing with and against each other in this game. Highly recommend it.
10/10
"This game has aged a bit, in the building queues and group management, but it is still pretty good today. Would convert a catapult again/10"
It is very good. 1v1 me. I'll rekt u with my conquistadores.
"Set Difficulty to standard. me and a friend 2 v 1 a computer. Both of us get wrecked within 30 mins. Yup, still just as good as before. 10/10"
"Age of Empires II showcases realistic politics, fighting, and gathering of resources true to the ancient times. Fight people with trebuchets, utilize unique civilization's units, and discover new methods of warfare as you advance through the ages. Become Britan today and shoot everyone in the face with arrows. 10/10"
This is a classic and could be the best RTS I've played.
One of the best RTS games of all time!
"Age of Empires II HD, same graphics, same wolfs killing your villagers, same game. 10/10"
Only get's better with Age.
Classic RTS with great replayability.
"A game I played as a kid, back in HD, with new expansions? Still one of the most balanced and fun RTS games I have ever played. Highly recommended!"
Do not play online if u don't know the hotkeys
"11/10 - Gonna WOLOLO the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone again,"
A great game that is infinitely replayable. Age of Empires is the greatest strategy series of all time!
Stands the test of time better than any other game I can think of.
As fun as it was when it came out
One of the best games ever.
"Ageless classic, now with more expansions!"
Still like to play it
Classic game. Online play is often very laggy.
Childhood 10/10
great game
Epic Game! Even after all these years and now in HD still an amazing game.
has been fun ever since it came out and it is still fun today.
fun as hell
AoE 2 HD is what you know and love about old RTS because it is old RTS in higher resolution
Still as fun to play as when it first came out. You can always find a multiplayer game and the campaign is great.
This Game is just a Classic. It makes so much fun to play.  Also... Sheep Scouting!
My childhood brought back in HD. If you're a fan that spent countless hours playing this back in the day prepare to do the same with even more hours put in due to steam workshop support. Highly reccommend this game especially with the summer sale going on at the moment. Instant Classic in fewer words!!
All hail the good old Age of Empires II Never gets old Wish aoe 1 comes to steam as well  9/10
Can't play this enough. Good ole fashion real time strategy.
AOE II HD is awesome.  AOE II was by far the best AOE. The only problem was to set up multiplayer. With AOE II HD it is possible to simply play over Steam what is incredibly comfortable and working very well.  If you also got the 2 extension packs (The Forgotten and African Kingdomes) you can choose from incredibly many and versatile nations. I've spent many hours on it and that while already having hundrets of hours on the normal AOE II.  Since the gameplay is so good and the price is actually pretty low it is worth 100% of it's money. Especially since it even gets updated - and considering it's a really really old game that's fantastic.
Now and again it's fun to just play this with a group of friends. But nobody can be the Teutons. That's just cheating...
"The best immortal game ! Shut-up, buy it and vote for the test of time award."
"Age of Empires II HD, same graphics, same wolfs killing your villagers, same game. 10/10"
Only get's better with Age.
Classic RTS with great replayability.
"A game I played as a kid, back in HD, with new expansions? Still one of the most balanced and fun RTS games I have ever played. Highly recommended!"
Do not play online if u don't know the hotkeys
"11/10 - Gonna WOLOLO the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone again,"
A great game that is infinitely replayable. Age of Empires is the greatest strategy series of all time!
Stands the test of time better than any other game I can think of.
As fun as it was when it came out
"This game is so much fun and a classic. I remember having lan parties playing 8 player multiplayer until 4 in the morning.   This game is a Real Time Strategy that allows you to harvest food, wood, stone and gold to create an empire progressing from the dark ages to the imperial age. You have to balance between creating enough villagers to sustain your growth and have a big enough army to protect yourself.   I highly recommend this game, get it on sale if you can but it is worth every penny."
I do recommend this game to others who like rts games or if you already played Age of Empires II the original version and not the HD version of the game. Age of Empires II HD added many new civilizations. Ive played this from when it first came out and let me tell you this HD version blew me away with all the new updates and DLC. I have 2 of the new DLC and now working on getting the latest DLC Rise of the Rajas and might be awhile but hopefully by time I do get it they add more DLC. This game is awesome and ive always been a huge fan of Age of Empires II and the HD version is alive with Multiplayer. They should do an HD version for Age of Empires. I say this again I do recommend you to get this game.
"I haven't put hours into this, I did however lose days, weeks, months and years to the original and only just found out that this existed.   So what's new, not a great deal but it runs smoothly, has steam workshop &amp; new expansions; basically it's what it used to be but better, they've left the basics alone and just made more of it.   Can't be a bad thing in my book, plus you can get Monty Python taunts through the workshop.   Really what else do you need to know? If you liked the original there's no reason at all not to get this!!!"
Just one of the most fun games ever.
  A lasting relationship:
"Over the years I have played well over a thousand hours on Age of Empires 2, and a good amount of time on it's predecessor (and less so on it's sequel). Unfortunately I have less time and more games now I'm older and have it on steam, but my gosh, does it stand up to the test of time! (yes, yes it does.)  Significantly harder Ai in the HD edition, but with the choice to use old Ai - increased population limits and various fixes and extra's just really round off what was already a pretty ace game!  Just a shame I paid full price and then found it down to like £4 :/  Probably worth the full price anyway to be fair.  Only thing I can complain about , about the ENTIRE game, is that they've now started bringing out some over-priced add on's, which I believe if you have already purchased the'Full edition' should be included... as they will be from now on I would imagine.. :L Still, in terms of gameplay.... my favorite RTS game. Ever. :)"
On of the bests
"Nothing really different in this version, but the game is still worth playing. 9.5/10"
I have so many amazing recent games on my pc and yet I still spend hours playing this. Very good game!
"Grew up with this masterpiece, so many memories, do you member? (:"
  my favourite and one of the best rts of all time
  Still holds up. One of the best out there.
great game.
"Old school awesome RTS, gre up playing it. Still ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Go britons!"
"A brilliant RTS with amazing design, hundreads of hours of replability. Has aged well, due to the lack of other RTS' games in the last 10 years, although the pathfinding and engine can be annoying from time to time, there is so few other RTS games with this much simplicity and depth. I do not have nostalgia for this game, only played for the first time this year and cannot play any other RTS' becuase this one is the best. The swan song of the RTS genre, before it died. 10/10 best 'woolloo' ever"
"this game is a classic will never get old, updated graphics mean it will be playable for another 10 years well done guys 5/5"
The game we all remember from our childhood - in HD!
It's crazy how I am putting so many hours into this game still like 10 years ago. I highly recommend buying this game if you are a fan of RTS's or simply want to get into it! If you are a veteran of this game I'd get the DLC. With the new civ's comes more different ways to approach the game which is really refreshing for a player like me who has been playing this for ages.
a classic back from the froggoten ones. awesome game worth it especially if you buy the collection for 20 $ thanks steam
"Playing since 99, wololo everyday. 10/10"
"This game was what I did after school in high school. I've never come close to being as good at a game as I was at this one. It holds a special place in my heart, and here they are updating it still. Great game, buy it, play it, love it."
makes a lot of fun with friends :D
This game is a classic. CLASSIC!
one of the best rts games Can't Be Better For an HD Edition
childhood *-*
It's a rts game thats good enough for me to come back to even now.
Bringing back the nostalgia of childhood LANs.
"Best game ever.  Stands the test of time.  Easy to pick up for new players too, (many guides online if you get stuck!)"
This game is a hoot. Kinda bad that the ♥♥♥♥ing monkey Spartans is always causing a ruckus in the house.
"The best RTS game of all time. You need to have deep knowledge to actually play it well, yet it is very easy to play. Quite accurate historically. Unique unit is very unique, attack bonus and speciality is trully made difference in how to play your civilization strategically. This game has its drawback for sure, no height measurement and no proper unit scalling. Too many halberd and skirmisher could render the game akward, also please note that black forest is coward party cake."
Timeless game which just never gets old.
"The HD remake doesn't bring much new to the table, even the graphics are mostly the same. However, if you've lost the original discs or otherwise have trouble running the original this is a fine alternative."
best strategy game of all time.
"If you've played AoE II previously, then embark on a nostalgia trip in which you will not be disappointed. After all these years the game is just as fun if not more fun than it was in the years around its original release. The game has been revamped with more modern graphics that are still in the style of the original. There is a whole new campaign to complete, as well as better AI than in the original.  If you haven't played this game before, I'd still recommend it if you're an RTS fan. It's typically slower paced than modern RTS games like StarCraft II for instance, due to the age progression system (which can be customised or forgone completely). It's kind of like Civ in terms of technological progression and research, but an RTS instead of a turn based strategy game.   If you're skeptical then my recommendation is to buy on sale. AoE II played a massive part in popularising RTS (alongside StarCraft and Command &amp; Conquer). It's a must have for strategy fans."

One of the best RTS out there that has really endured the test of time. 9/10
A classic that never gets old. The HD remake / expansions have managed to expand on a brilliant game without ruining anything that made it so great the first time around. Highly recommend!
5/7 would wololo again
As timeless as ever! An incredibly fun game that never gets old.
One of if not the best RTS ever made. Now in HD!
good game and brings back heaps of memories
This game is lit xD! KidsRunTh3World!!!
"I remember watching one of my family members playing this as a child and I was had extreme wounder for it... Sadly during that time it was around 2000 or something like that and I was about 7 years old. Now, thanks to the powers of the beautiful internet and the fantastic devs we now have it for Steam. I might not be very good even against a normal AI but this game is great and I love it. Single-player also? I'll be better at that tbh. This was the first RTS I've seen in a long time that gets me coming back now and then.  Test of time for sure.  ... Dem some op Monks though."
This is a good game.
Best RTS game ever made. Playing since I was 7 years old.
This is the best game from my childhood.It introduced me to gaming. 10/10
"  I passed middle school history class thanks entirely to the content of the original game. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys passing middle school history with the aid of HD textures, mamelukes, atrocious AI and solid classic RTS multiplayer."
"One of the best games ever, it is definatly worth the £2.99."
"  Classics stay classics forever. Nominated it for 'Test of Time', as it's deserved."
A classic RTS that is still going strong.
steals your childhood
jesse is really good at this game and that hurt me

childhood *-*
Very Wololo
"Bought the original when it first came out along with the expansion later on, and was hooked. I could not even guess how many hours I put into the game. I played others in the series, along with similiar games but kept coming back to this one over and over.  I was worried about picking the HD remake up fearing that it would not stand up compared to my memory of the game, like so many other games I have gone back to play years later. But I decided to buy it, and I am not disappointed.  I look forward to reliving the campaign, long with the two new expansions. Maybe even checking out what is available in the workshop."
My childhood reborn
"One of the best games ever made, playing for last 12 years."
"  This game is a classic that will hopefully live on for a long time and serve as a template for RTS empire building games in the futurre. I have spent many hours on this game, and most of those were spent playing random skirmish games or multiplayer games with my friends. I have played some of the campaign mode, and enjoyed it, but my favorite part of this game is hands down multiplayer. If you are really good at RTS games and think that an AI can never give you a challenge, I highly recommend trying the updated AI on this game. Many of my friends find the 'moderate' difficulty to be a challenge, and only a select few of us have been able to handle 'hard' and occasionally 'hardest.' I have always liked a challenge and the AI in this game bring it. I stronlgy recommend this game to anyone who likes RTS games, or even thinks they might. This game started a love of RTS games for me, and I know it will continue to do the same for others."

"Possibly the best game I have played in my life, even tho it's old it still holds a special place in my heart."
"bought this on steam sale and it was the 4,99€ worth totally!  Played this in my chilhood and i went straight in to play 2 hours in a row without even notice the time :)  Great game to play once again 10/10 &lt;3"
A must have game!
A great real time strategy game that only other age of empire games can compete with.
First time I played this I was about 8 and at 22 I can say this game has aged very well. Fair enough the graphics leave alot to be desired compared to modern equivalents but game play wise it's still great fun with friends. I really hope one day we see an aoe 4 but I wouldn't bet on it.
400 hours on steam and a lot more off steam. Great old school game that is worth playing.
Really good real time strat game.
One of the best games ever made
Honestly this game is one of my all time favs no matter when or where this game is fu
Pretty good
This game was my childhood and is just as good as I remember. Wololol
"Age of Empires II was one of my favourite games growing up and I put so many hours into it. To have an HD re-release was the best news for me. A perfect point and click strategy game that incorporates different cultures, teaching you along the way. I'd highly recommend it to any gamer; I'm not a fan of strategy games but I love this a lot."
"Played it back in '99 when it released and still play it today, definitely a game that deserves the 'Test of Time' award."
Great RTS
Amazing gameplay for a game over 10 years old and any RTS player should have this in their library.
"I've played this game (on and off) since I was in 1st grade. (true story)  I've bought copies of it at least 4 times as discs became too scratched to use, and now I have the immortal Steam version forever.  You haven't played RTS games until you've played this classic gem. Just buy it."
jesse is really good at this game and that hurt me
A great trip down memory lane.
Excellent in every way.
"Age of Empires II HD doesn't really justify it's existence well, other than the Forgotten expansion there's no real reason if you already have AOEII to buy this. The HD part of AOE2 is barely noticable, the game still looks decades old but now somethings are a bit more shinier.  The original flaws of AOE are still there, (four resources to gather for everything, a separate resource for castles, sword line of infantry has no real use and archers do their job ten times better, some of the maps have spawning problems with the boars)   As is the fun stuff, it's still great to play. The campaigns are still fun, all of it's there. But the price and the HD ness of it is rather unwelcome.  All in all I very modestly recommend it, but if you have the original AOE2 and aren't interested in the forgotten then you aren't missing anything here."
"Haven't played this since i was a kid, picked it up recently its over tawps .....maybe im being a lil nostalgic"
"It's a history teacher in a form of a ridiculously interesting yet fun game. Come on, who doesn't like games?"
"I just love this game. Its so awesome, everybody´s gotta love it. I have spent hundreds of hours while playing this game before. But then, the newer games came and I forgot about this. Today, I have found it and I realised, that the newer games werent even a half of this one. Recommended, thank you for the sale :)"
"The best thing about AoE II is how each civilization has a substantial enough bonus to make play styles unique in every case, and each civlization is overpowered enough to actually make it balanced. A brilliant game that absolutely holds up today."
Great game to sit back and relax. enjoy it :)
Really fun when you get to know the game and you have friends
"Nostalgic, still in love with this game!"
"I load up a custom map, play for an hour, and it turns out that there's no enemies on the map, because the default difficulty mode is set to 'easy.' So I load up a campaign, and realize that nothing happens, and I win from walking from one end of the map to the other (where's the empire-building?). I decide to flip to the next campaign, Joan of Arc, and the mission is exactly the same: walk from one end of the map to the other. Where's the castle-building? I'm tired of hearing old British and French accents try to make up for the lack of gameplay."
Quality game.
What's a better use of a Farm Animal than to explore the map?
It is an amazing and most importantly successful effort how to bring new life into an old game. Must buy for anyone who used to play it as the game gives the same enjoyable experience as many years ago with a new twist (if you get some of the DLCs).
"Childhood memories, GG"
Better than the origional. I sepent hundereds id not thousands of hours of my life in this game and not I can start it all over again in HD.
A must buy for every RTS players!
The Byzantine trash army marches on!!
"I've been playing this game ever since it's release back in 1999, an absolute classic that never seems to get old. I have nothing but love for this game."
Awsome game brings back memories Love it!
"Love this Game so much, Never get Tired of playing it, definetly worth buying :)"
Best played with DragonForce. It will give you the epic feels.
"One of the best multi player as well as single player, real time strategy game in the history."
"A great game but not entirely perdect due to strange, unpredicted performance issues, excecially with the latest update"
It never gets old. More than 14 years playing and counting.
Omg so good to go back and play age of empires 2 again!! It looks awesome in HD and the multiplayer function is great! I really enjoy this and will play this alot. :)
Full price in my opinon is way too expensive. but I got it on sale for like $5 but it is still alright.
Finally after 3 years of a disgusting gameplay experience. The developers managed to make age of empires 2 HD as smooth as the original edition. Hence I am chaning my negative review to a positive one.   Good on you Devs!
"My orginal experience with Age of Empires II was when I was about 6 and all I would do was mess around in the map editor. This was the pinnacle of my enjoyment for some reason and coming back to it I can see why. The map editor is just the best thing ever, giving you the ability to spawn hordes of units to fight each other and also see if 1000 elite janissarys can defeat 10 cobra cars (yes they are a thing). I do fully recommend you purchase this game and if you don't own any of the other Microsoft RTS remasters then you should definitely pick up the bundle. The campaigns are challenging but enjoyable and the multiplayer is extremely fun when playing with friends. My only critiscism is with the new AI. If you set the difficulty to higher than lowest, they will just rush you with an army and/or fleet during the second age (be prepared for that)."
"Well, what can i say?  Truly one of those games you just can't get out of your head. I grew up with it, playing it late at night so my parents 'couldn't watch me playing those violent mind-poisoning games', and I gotta say, every minute was worth it. Still love the voice-acting, even doe I had to get the spanish voice acting from my old disc. But everything else, the new details, the new water, the new feeling you get, not only nostalgia. It truly makes this game worth every single cent. If you haven't tried it out, I recommend you to do it. Trust me, it's worth it."
"This game is brilliant. Even years after its' release, it's still one of the best RTS games I've ever played. The expansions are a blast too."
I do recommend this game to others who like rts games or if you already played Age of Empires II the original version and not the HD version of the game. Age of Empires II HD added many new civilizations. Ive played this from when it first came out and let me tell you this HD version blew me away with all the new updates and DLC. I have 2 of the new DLC and now working on getting the latest DLC Rise of the Rajas and might be awhile but hopefully by time I do get it they add more DLC. This game is awesome and ive always been a huge fan of Age of Empires II and the HD version is alive with Multiplayer. They should do an HD version for Age of Empires. I say this again I do recommend you to get this game.
On of the bests
I have never loved farming so much !
"--- Long review incoming ---  - Short version -  Age of Empires II is still damn awesome after so many years. Even if you can notice it's age (geddit? huehuehue) it's a classic that has stand up to the test of time. If you are a veteran or new to Real-Time strategy games, Age of Empires II will not dissapoint.  - Short version ends here - --------------------------------------------  Even if it's been nearly a decade since I played it, and even more since it was realeased, there's no doubt why Age of Empires II is still one of the RTS games that is still played even today, and with new life brought with the HD edition there's even more to enjoy. Even though you can see clearly how it has aged, comapred to other games of the same and similar genre, AoE II gives you hours of fun, frustration, planning and enjoyment. I was way too young when I played this to really understand it and appreciate it to it's fullest, but since then I knew this was a gem and throughout the years I still found myself wanting to play this again and not even just out of nostalgia. And now, I can remember and re-discover an all time classic once again. If your new to RTS games or an ol' ♥♥♥ veteran, you can always count on AoE II for an awesome game that just keeps on giving, even after more than ten years."
"Out of 100, i'd give htis game a 30 WOLOLO Um excuse me? So yeah I would give this game around a 30 out o- WOLOLO. EXCUSE ME? So yeah, 30 out - WOLOLO OH MY GOD CAN YOU STOP? SCREW THIS I NOW GIVE THIS GAME A 14 OUT OF - 'Start the game already!'"
"This is the game that made me a gamer. If i have more than a 1000 games in all plataforms, this is the one responsable, age I start, age II confirmed."
"As incredibly good as the day it first launched many years ago. The new civilizations, tweaks and revalances are really nice too. And best of all, it works great in new computers and modern screens!"
"An awesome upgrade from the first AoE, that I consider to be the best game ever. AoE 2 stepped up a knotch and still remains one of the most amusing game to date. Buy that s*** bro!"
"It doesn't matter how many matches you've played, the game never feels repetetive. As one progress within the game and becomes better, one learns the true complexity, and the huge variety of strategies that the game with its mechanics offer. Besides that, it's a true classic, and it usually goes for around 5 euros during steam sales.  This is one of my favorite games of all time, and ever since my father introduced me to this un-polished gem, I've invested countless hours into it.  A solid 1/10, wolololol, 10/1  Sidenote: after you've played a couple of games on the map 'black forest', you will establish a hate towards Britannia."
this is my favorite out of the age on empires games and was the game that got me into RTS games. picked it for the test of time reward for this one will last longer then any of the other age of empire games
What a game!
"One of the best multi player as well as single player, real time strategy game in the history."
"A great game but not entirely perdect due to strange, unpredicted performance issues, excecially with the latest update"
It never gets old. More than 14 years playing and counting.
My favorite since I was a child. 1 /1
Game doesn't launch anymore just crashes instantly.
A resurrected classic that's as good as you remember it.
Omg so good to go back and play age of empires 2 again!! It looks awesome in HD and the multiplayer function is great! I really enjoy this and will play this alot. :)
Full price in my opinon is way too expensive. but I got it on sale for like $5 but it is still alright.
This Game Was 11/10 i dont know why but maybe it's mabelene
My childhood
"Oldschool game, but still one of my favourite strategy multiplayer games! Multiplayer works and the game is fun to play for a long time"
"I'm pretty new to the RTS genre as a whole. I've dabbled with a few games of the sort before, such as the Starcraft 2 demo! I managed to pick this game up during the Steam Winter Sale, for a mighty five smackeroonies! Oh boy, oh boy, what a fantastic purchase for a medieval and history buff such as myself! I was skeptical of my purchase due to the somewhat intimidating gameplay! It features 2 main campaign stories, and i've heard from colleagues, that the DLC content is quite enjoyable! and if you enjoy the African variety of DLC, lemme jus say, WE WUZ KANGZ &amp; SHHIIEEET ! haHaa"
how do i check if i have the latest updated PATCH for AGE OF EMPIRES HD ???
"This game is so much fun and a classic. I remember having lan parties playing 8 player multiplayer until 4 in the morning.   This game is a Real Time Strategy that allows you to harvest food, wood, stone and gold to create an empire progressing from the dark ages to the imperial age. You have to balance between creating enough villagers to sustain your growth and have a big enough army to protect yourself.   I highly recommend this game, get it on sale if you can but it is worth every penny."
"I'm writing this review after a long time of not playing it, since when AoE II HD launched it had serious lag issues when a lot of units were on screen, and tremendous desync on multiplayer.  Now that they've launched their third DLC Rise of the Rajas and with it large updates as well, I've gone back to testing the game and yep, they've done it. The game now works flawlessly even on low end PC's and even if a little bit of lag happens with 600+ units on screen, that's unavoidable because of the original game engine limitations.  They are making new content all the time and it's amazing to see this game getting updates and new civs available after so long . The original appeal is still there and the DLC's are true to the original feeling. This is definitely worth your money if you're a long time fan."
Terrific game even after 17 years   *salutes with a tear rolling down the face*
"A brilliant RTS with amazing design, hundreads of hours of replability. Has aged well, due to the lack of other RTS' games in the last 10 years, although the pathfinding and engine can be annoying from time to time, there is so few other RTS games with this much simplicity and depth. I do not have nostalgia for this game, only played for the first time this year and cannot play any other RTS' becuase this one is the best. The swan song of the RTS genre, before it died. 10/10 best 'woolloo' ever"
"Grew up with this masterpiece, so many memories, do you member? (:"
Very fun game to play with friends but my laptop broke down so I fixed my old iMac (don't have money) and apperently it's not available on Mac. I would rate this 9/10 just because it's not available for me D':
The best.
I'm almost done with my first match
It's the same game as before with working multiplayer through steam. Worth it to get on sale for sure if you have people to play with.
excellent version of a game ive always loved. well worth a play. 30min to 1hour single player or play for hours on campaign.
Game patch has screwed things up
"I have played this game for over a decade. I always found myself playing this, I was glued to my computer and couldn't stop playing this for hours on end. After I saw that there was a HD version on this I wanted it right away. Though I only have a little over 100 hours on Steam, it doesn't amount to the number I have played offline without Steam. This game has always been an instant favorite. Total recommendation to those who love strategy games. Must buy."
"I've always loved Age of Empires since I first played it. Although to me this game looks the same as the non-HD version, its still fun nevertheless.  Pros: Challenging Requires quick economical strategy Everything  Cons: This game doesnt look too different from the original, but yet I lack some FPS when having a population of like over 175 people or more. You'd think that for a game that has very simple 3d graphics and the people dont even have faces that it'd run better, but for some odd reason it doesnt.  Overall score: 9/10 Conclusion: BUY THIS GAME!"
Love it
I do recommend this game to others who like rts games or if you already played Age of Empires II the original version and not the HD version of the game. Age of Empires II HD added many new civilizations. Ive played this from when it first came out and let me tell you this HD version blew me away with all the new updates and DLC.

This game is awesome and ive always been a huge fan of Age of Empires II and the HD version is alive with Multiplayer. They should do an HD version for Age of Empires. I say this again I do recommend you to get this game.
Classic...
  my favourite and one of the best rts of all time
Really cheap on sales with a lot of flexibilty for the price
"Even after many years, this game is still fun, and people still play it! This game originally game out in 1999 I think (correct me if im wrong) and many people still play it. I reccomend it if you want a good RTS experience."
Bought this as a package deal with AOE 3HD. I played the originals back in the day. Lots of fun. Very happy with the remake. Looks much better. 9/10
"Just got my report, its bad very bad but at least i restored the javanese empire to its former glory"
Stands the test of time... Still love this Game.
Classic...
  Still holds up. One of the best out there.
  classic from 1999 very old graphics great RTS gameplay 
great game.
"Old school awesome RTS, gre up playing it. Still ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Go britons!"
"A brilliant RTS with amazing design, hundreads of hours of replability. Has aged well, due to the lack of other RTS' games in the last 10 years, although the pathfinding and engine can be annoying from time to time, there is so few other RTS games with this much simplicity and depth. I do not have nostalgia for this game, only played for the first time this year and cannot play any other RTS' becuase this one is the best. The swan song of the RTS genre, before it died. 10/10 best 'woolloo' ever"
"Grew up with this masterpiece, so many memories, do you member? (:"
  my favourite and one of the best rts of all time
I enjoy sending my villagers into battle in a ravaged bloodlust and winning games
Brings back memories.
"Possibly the best game I have played in my life, even tho it's old it still holds a special place in my heart."
I have been playing this game since its release. I was so excited to have the game re-release in HD. The group that I play with have been playing this game since 1999. That's over 15 years and the game is still fun to play.
:)
"Simply put. Best strategy game I have ever played. First time I played this game was the original version by the end of the 90's, and After all this years I still find it a great piece of entertainment."
I've been playing this game since the oringal came out and I love it. The new civs are very cool and the online is starting to get less and less buggy. I very much like this game.
great game
My childhood
"A classic RTS game and a favorite for anyone who grew up in the 90s. Pure nostalgia, updated for screens twenty years more advanced than originally intended - 9/10 - Exactly what its supposed to be!"
Still as fun as I remember from being a kid!
"If you're here because you remember this game from your childhood, but don't know if you want to buy it as an adult, then this review is for you.  I bought this game based entirely on nostalgia, having been a fan of the series in my childhood. Attempting to make the civilizations work, failing, then cheating a car or twenty into existence to shoot everyone was as much a part of my growing up as Saturday morning cartoons. However, as soon as I bought it, I was beset by the fear this game would not live up to the rose-tinted memories of my youth.  I should never have worried.  As an adult, I have a far better understanding of how strategy works (I did not have the patience for things like nuance in my video games a kid), so now I can actually PLAY the game! And good God, what a game! Because of the changes I've undergone as a person, I can actually enjoy it more than ever before. Not only that, but because there's now new expansions, I can play as even more civilizations than ever (not that the kid me would have cared, but still).  I can honestly say, after close to two decades, I still love this game."
"Edit : Game works great now! Thanks to the devs who work on updating the game daily.    This review is mainly concerning people looking to play online with friends.   I love AOE2HD but after the recent update the multiplayer is unplayable for me. The match starts - some guy gets a lag spike, and thats it boom, desync. The game desyncs and you lose rating. Rating is usually not important, but it sucks when people wont let you join matches because of your rating being low.  So far today I've not been able to play a single match without it getting desynced. I regret buying the new expansion so early. I'm not sure if its only for people who bought the expansion or everyone thats getting affected by it but it really sucks.  Before the update multiplayer had its issues but never as bad as this. "
This great is literally a Hitory teacher and time consumer.
"Oldschool game, but still one of my favourite strategy multiplayer games! Multiplayer works and the game is fun to play for a long time"
how do i check if i have the latest updated PATCH for AGE OF EMPIRES HD ???
"I'm pretty new to the RTS genre as a whole. I've dabbled with a few games of the sort before, such as the Starcraft 2 demo! I managed to pick this game up during the Steam Winter Sale, for a mighty five smackeroonies! Oh boy, oh boy, what a fantastic purchase for a medieval and history buff such as myself! I was skeptical of my purchase due to the somewhat intimidating gameplay! It features 2 main campaign stories, and i've heard from colleagues, that the DLC content is quite enjoyable! and if you enjoy the African variety of DLC, lemme jus say, WE WUZ KANGZ &amp; SHHIIEEET ! haHaa"
  A lasting relationship:
Just one of the most fun games ever.
Just one of the most fun games ever.
"Over the years I have played well over a thousand hours on Age of Empires 2, and a good amount of time on it's predecessor (and less so on it's sequel). Unfortunately I have less time and more games now I'm older and have it on steam, but my gosh, does it stand up to the test of time! (yes, yes it does.)  Significantly harder Ai in the HD edition, but with the choice to use old Ai - increased population limits and various fixes and extra's just really round off what was already a pretty ace game!  Just a shame I paid full price and then found it down to like £4 :/  Probably worth the full price anyway to be fair.  Only thing I can complain about , about the ENTIRE game, is that they've now started bringing out some over-priced add on's, which I believe if you have already purchased the'Full edition' should be included... as they will be from now on I would imagine.. :L Still, in terms of gameplay.... my favorite RTS game. Ever. :)"
On of the bests
Still a great classic!
"Amazing, sooooo nostalgic I found this game here in steam and I was so excited that a had to tell my friends and recomend them the game and I´m sure they bought it and we started our forgotten adiction."
It's AoE2...with Conquorers...what else is there to say?

"Buy it if you have memories. If not, dont buy it. Its not a good game anymore as there are many other options out there and if youve played any modern games, the gameplay is very slow compared to them resulting in you not being engaged. Simple mechanics, simple game. Only buy it for the memories"
"This is a fantastic game! Not only can it teach history, but building an empire and crushing everyone else with units like Petards can be fun, competitive, and hilarious."
Bought this as a package deal with AOE 3HD. I played the originals back in the day. Lots of fun. Very happy with the remake. Looks much better. 9/10
"Even after many years, this game is still fun, and people still play it! This game originally game out in 1999 I think (correct me if im wrong) and many people still play it. I reccomend it if you want a good RTS experience."

It's crazy how I am putting so many hours into this game still like 10 years ago. I highly recommend buying this game if you are a fan of RTS's or simply want to get into it! If you are a veteran of this game I'd get the DLC. With the new civ's comes more different ways to approach the game which is really refreshing for a player like me who has been playing this for ages.
a classic back from the froggoten ones. awesome game worth it especially if you buy the collection for 20 $ thanks steam
Great Games. Love it
The game we all remember from our childhood - in HD!
Greatest startegy game ever made!!!!! No doubt about this!

Still a great classic!
fun hope they will make aoe 3 look better to
"I used to play game this game when I was younger, about 10 years old, and I do not regret from knowing this game. I am know 17 and keep playing AOE2. It has been one of the most beloved games I have ever played because of the different histories from each civilization, I have also liked it because you can use strategies to defeat your enemy and you could also play online with different people and improve your skills at the same time. I have only but a good review about this game. If you like history and strategies, this is the game you should play."
I heard it's better than Civ 5 with the brave new world expansion pack!
"'rogen?' not in this game tho, 0/10 don't buy"
This is a great game. Has something for everyone. You can play one fo the 20ish singleplayer campaigns or you can do some competetive multiplayer. Very fun and rewards strategic players for knowing which unit counters to use in each siuation. Highly reccomended
"Very nostalgia, very still suck at it. "
"Oh does this game bring me back. So many hours spent with this, possibly my favorite RTS of all time."
Litterally the same game but that's why it's good.
"Not able to start, kept prompting main.cpp(312)"
to my friends u simply must but this game i wish they gave the jassanaries their pointy hats back
Classic Love  Simply fun
Excellent update to the original 1999 game. Multiplayer option is easy to navigate and I haven't had any issues with lag or freezing while playing. I highly recommend AOE II HD if you enjoy RTS games.
"Stays faithful to the original game, but with improvements like fullscreen on HD and better perfromance when you get large populations."
This game needs no review. Just play it and relive your childhood.
A beloved game of my childhood. I'm happy I can play it again.
"Still a great game, always will be"
"I was playing this when i was child, sometimes with dad but now i know all the strategies. I would totally recommend this and + there is a funny story.  I ALWAYS PLAY AGAINST FUC*ING SLAVS? ALWAYS FUC*ING MONK RUSHES, ALWAYS STEALING WHOLE OF MY FUC*ING FULLY UPGRADED ARMY??? 10/10 would get Wololo'd again."
"great game, so much workshop support"

"Excellent game. Has aged extremely well, the HD edition makes the game look a bit prettier, but the gameplay remains excellent regardless of resolution or graphics level. Super fun to play against friends with, campaigns are well made, 10/10 would recommend."
one of my favorite games of all time highly this
Excellent update to the original 1999 game. Multiplayer option is easy to navigate and I haven't had any issues with lag or freezing while playing. I highly recommend AOE II HD if you enjoy RTS games.
A classic.
"Age of Empires II is a classic amongst many gamers. I however much prefer Age of Mythology probably because I played it first, but that's irrelevant. This game is far from 'HD'. The only changes they've made graphically is better resolution support, and slightly better textures and water, as well as multiple monitor support and various other minor changes.  The game has a working multiplayer, and it still has the original music and sounds. Very much like the re-release Age of Mythology.  So, do I recommend this game? Yes. But I don't recommend paying more than £10 for it."
I've played this game on more computers than I can remember.
"The game which never goes boring~ A decade ago I was playing this game.A decade later,here I am still playing this awesome game~ My childhood=AOE2"
great back then even better now if you played this game as a kid all the memories will just come back and if you didnt its time to make some great memories
HD Remaster doesn't add a whole lot to the graphics. But a few subtle improvements are definitely nice. Classic game.
9/10   Great classic
Great game!!
"How quaint... an army of rams.  I first played this game with my husband when we were first married. I was delighted to find it again now I can play with my daughters too.  I love teaching my daughters that neither they nor their dad will ever defeat me.   All hail, King of the Losers!"
"Fast-paced RTS has you exploiting natural resources, constructing beautiful wonders and formidable castles, and advancing from the Dark Ages to the much more dignified-sounding Imperial Age.   "
"WOLLOOLO I would again, a fun classic strategy game"
Classic!
A classic.
"very good game, and fun to play with friends "
9/10   Great classic
I have been playing this game since I was eight years old. Even though it can run a bit slow and doesn't have the best graphics I will always recommend it.
Not many games have aged as well as this one. Still a classic and great balanced multiplayer if you have a few friends willing to play with you. It is also very addictive with a small but passionate community. If you can grab it at the sale price it is a steal. Can't recommend enough.
"One of the finnest rts of the last 2 decades, even though it's not as radical visual change over the original, the expansions keep it fresh and interesting, if you plan to play it online I recommend playing through voobly, altough it requires more step to set it up, it's more stable and reliable than through the game itself."
"This game is one of the only games for me that has stood the test of time.  From playing this game as a kid, through my teens and finally as an adult, the game has never gotten old. Many different strategies for all sorts of different civilizations allow for varied gameplay for all skill levels. With an invredibly high skill-cap, and many game modes for variations in play, this game is by far one of  my all time favourites."
HD Remaster doesn't add a whole lot to the graphics. But a few subtle improvements are definitely nice. Classic game.
this is a good game
"I do not usually enjoy this type of game. But after praise from a dear friend of mine, I decided to give it a go. I have only just begun playing and I am truely enjoying the experience. I feel the more I learn about the game the closer I am getting to becoming addicted. I highly recommend you purchase this game during the winter sale. (the time I am writing this review) You cant beat the quality for this low of a price."
"This game is great. The only thing I find hard is when you are being attacked at the same time as your allies so you cant help them.This is a really fun game, I usually hate these types of games but I used to play the first AOE when I was little and this is just as good. I recommend the campaign."
"Still a great game, always will be"
"I was playing this when i was child, sometimes with dad but now i know all the strategies. I would totally recommend this and + there is a funny story.  I ALWAYS PLAY AGAINST FUC*ING SLAVS?

This is my least favirote game ever!
This is probably my favorite game of all time. Glad to see its back. There are a few things missing like yyou cant assign units like you used to and there no military drag select. Minor complaints but still one of the best RTS games of all time.
"Stays faithful to the original game, but with improvements like fullscreen on HD and better perfromance when you get large populations."

"very good game, its easy to sit back relax and play. would woolooloo again"
Love it still playing
"This is one of my most favorite games, I played it alot when I was little but then the newer computers werent able to play it anymore on any of the 5 different copies we had of it. But then a pure genius made this remastered version and it is awesome I love it. Though when u are playing multiplayer make sure everyone has a good connection or else it could ruin the game"
"Kept getting my butt whooped by an NPC who'd built really solid walls and  tons  of trebuchets. As a last resort, I threw all my Priests into the mix, hoping they could heal my thinning forces. Rather than heal anyone, they wololo'd two enemy trebuchets into submission which subsequently took out their trebuchets, walls, buildings and a good chunk of archers. Then I ran in and killed everyone, save for one priest doing his best Eduard Khil impression.   Tl;Dr  I changed the loyalties of inanimate objects by chanting nonsensically at them. 11/10 "

"  One of the first games I have ever played on computer. since the time of having big ol ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brick type computers with floppy disks..  with the steam additon and all the new add on's, it brings small gamer tears to my eyes of how fun this game will always be. yes the lag or game glitches is still an isssue, but in all other put aside, if you love games that stragy and like to play games with friend, this is the game to play."
Classic game reminds me of when I used to play. Great game.
"I grew up playing Age of Empires II on LAN with my father and brothers and have a lot of fun memories associated with this game. I'm glad to see it on Steam and even happier that it was recently given a major update. It's rare with older games that you get both nostalgia and new content. For any fans of the original back from the days of CD keys, you'll definitely love this package! I strongly recommend it!"

"Age of Empires 2 is still a lot of fun. i played the original version for hours. the AI is strong and in this HD version it is even more improved, so it is not a push over. the level editor is also very fun and lets you create your own levels and even campaigns.  the different campaigns are also worth playing and the original expansion (the conquerors) is included."

"This game should have won the Steam Test of Time Award.   AoE II has been going strong since 1999 and has defined a generation of RTS games and gamers. The fact that it is still being played by so many people and that it recently received yet another expansion proves that AoE II is not just a game. It is a legendary work of art that will continue to stand the test of time for many years to come.  Whenever critics exclaim that the RTS genre is dead, just remember: This game is alive and kicking."
