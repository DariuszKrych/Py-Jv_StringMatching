"I really like GRID 2 and I think it's the best racing game on Steam. Just keep in mind that it's not a racing simulator like GRID. It's Need for Speed: Greatest Hits. I can see huge chunks of various NFS games put into the game nicely like Touge on the California Dixon track at night is a canyon race from Carbon, sponsor decals, body and performance mods are from Underground, circuit races strongly remind me of ProStreet. Cote d'Azur track alone reminds me of Porsche Unleashed and brings a smile to my face. Codemasters made a great arcade racing game. Strong sides of the game: gorgeous graphics, awesome physics in terms of car behavior, great online matchmaking, single player campaign is fun to play and interesting to progress, AI can be easily adjusted to a desired difficulty. Minor complaints that I have: there's no way to change the in-game assistant's voice. Personally I really dislike that voice and ended up muting it. Many games have an option to change the voice that talks to you while you play 'cause it's important! You're stuck with this voice for hundreds of hours. In Crysis I was able to choose the voice of the nanosuit (male/female/robotic), in SR: TT and many other games there're similar options. The DLCs certainly crippled the game. Extra tracks and cars just don't fit in properly, e. g. you can't use Ford Sierra RS500 online and nobody races on Bathurst unless you create a custom lobby and invite friends to play it. The lack of cockpit view is an insult. I also miss Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche cars, but don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars to play with."
"I got this game on sale, and I wanted to like this game, I really did. I loved the first GRID. The graphics are really nice, among the best for a racing game when it came out. The single-player story mode is cheesy, but it does okay to fill the gaps between races. The engine sounds are mostly accurate, far more so than the first GRID game. It's really unfortunate that this is where the good parts of the game end.  The driving physics are awful. Literally some of the worst I've ever played. I understand they wanted to focus on drifting and making it a key component of racing, but it is so poorly implemented that certain vehicles are essentially unplayable. Driving the Koenigsegg Agera R is a nightmare... it feels exactly like driving on ice, which I have actual experience with, living in a place that gets really cold during the winter with tons of snow. It's really a shame that ALL of the cars drift. All of the vehicles, regardless of being described as 'Balanced' and / or 'Grip' when you select them, will drift, no matter how perfect you try to take a corner. As soon as you hit the brakes, you can feel the vehicle start to fishtail. Some cars are okay, but I've found at least 50% of the time, racing is just not an enjoyable experience.  Even worse is the computer AI. They drive their line and regardless of if they hit a wall, if you bump them, and even if you try to spin them out, it's nearly impossible, they do not make mistakes. It feels exactly like a crappy simulation, minus actually simulating anything.  I did enjoy the first 18 hours or so in the single-player game. Really the coolest part of the game was my second race when I drove up the side of a mountain, fell back down on top of the opponent's car, and still won the race. However, after over 21 hours, I've finally put my controller down in frustration, and most likely will not pick it back up for this game."
"This game is no simulator, and i've only played with gamepad.  After 7 hours I have to say i'm disssapointed, coming from GRID 1.  The game now focuses on city circuits with different gamemodes (Elimination, circuit changes on the go...) and doesn't focus on real competitions like the first one no Open wheel/DTM/GT/LMP classes of events and no Lemans Resistance races when the season ends. In 7 hours i've only visited 4 circuits so far, with no serious competition on them (just regular races, with different car classes on the same race), and the handling i'd say is a bit worse than on the first, with they wanting you to drift in every corner.  The plot of the game is to make a new series of racing globally, taking the best drivers of each part of the world. in each part of the world there are different gamemodes. (guess what: in japan they drift)  The game also feels like it puts together different vehicle classes and they more or less perform the same (Chevrolet Camaro against a Alfa Romeo 4C comes to mind)  And the whole point of 'we have to get fans from social networks to talk about us' with the TV show stuff (The game's storyline, i'd say) just feels for 12 years old.   I'd say they wanted to make the game easier for younger people.   I really liked GRID 1, but this one is average, shouldn't call itself GRID."
"I want to clear up that im not going to include Grid 1 to this review.   Gameplay on the tracks are mainly based on acrade style racing. Its all about investment in a new league of sport and becoming the number #1 contender and the number 1# fan.  What I like about Grid 2 are the tracks. They are fun and challenging to race on in career mode and online. The car personaliztion is near enough good, throwing in real life sponsors to put onto your car and personalize.   I was disappointed with the physics in use of the cars as the developers focused on the powersliding instead of clean turn exits to build better momentum through the corners. You may think thats essential for a great game but the handling will lead you to wreckless driving in most modes challenged on. Online as an example is almost unplayable for these reasons because players cant take full stable control around the corners for a clean race.   Another thing I was disapointed in was the input controls on the game. For a controller it wont be much of a problem driving cars but for keyboard users it will be. Most racing inputs ive used was the simple w,s,a,d &amp; (Arrows) and have no issues playing them smootly. For Grid 2 its difficult as its not keyboard friendly in a way of keeping your car stable around the corners and attempting most clean races. Ive tried both controller (F710) &amp; keyboard and its a major difference how you perform in the game.  Cockpit is not required in the game which is another downside for a latest racing release. DLC packs have been scattered around as typical developers want more money off you.   Pros:  + Tracks to drive on + Personalztion  Cons:  - Controls are unstable - Not Keyboard friendly compare to most racing games - No Cockpit - Codemasters greedy DLC Schemes - Graphics are not as good for its age  My rating: 65/100 Metascore rating: 80/100  Conclusion:  I dont reccomend this game full price for the aspects ive pointed out from it. If steam provide a discount give it a go and see what you think. Hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game."
"Game is good but i don't recommend it for a few reasons unless it's on sale or you can get it from a trader:  _ 'Racenet' If you want to do the global challenges or fully enjoy the multiplayer experience you need to have an account, like the rival thing. I thought your Steam friends are your rivals but no no, only racenets friends are your rivals. _ DLC you have not many cars unless you buy the dlc, also some circuits are only available after you buy overpriced DLC (5$, 6$, 10$) _ Your car is made of ♥♥♥♥ing polysteren when your opponents car are made of titanium. Ram them while taking a turn you fly away, stick behind them but keep accelerating you'll go at their speed and they wont even flinch. If they ram you during a turn you can be sure you'll loose control of your vehicle. If they're behind you pushing and you try to slow down or break you'll loose control, if you keep at your pace the back of your car will go sideways until you loose control. Driving a muscle car and getting hit by a roadster still makes you fly + damage your vehicle.  _ Drift cars, the worst thing in this game and there's plenty of race to do with these. The cars keep oversteering. _ Pinball effect, if you hit a wall you'll bounce on the ramp on the other side of the road. _ Sometimes if you're against the wall and hit a cone your car will explode. _ Opponents are driving at your speed, if you're slow they'll be slow. If you're ahead of them they'll catch up with you no matter how perfect you're racing. _ Except for you there's never any crash, if you're causing a pile up you'll be the only one ending up off road. The opponents will follow their racing lanes no matter what's happening ahead.  I think that pretty much sums up why i can't recommend this game, maybe these seem like small things but when every races you're the only one loosing control (and not just a little) once there's frictions between you and your opponent that you have to restart or go back in time every time it gets irritating.  About the good things of this game?  _ Graphics are pretty neat _ Different kind of events (Touge, Race, Time Attack, Drifts, Endurance, Takeover etc) _ Car customisation _ Decent career mode."
" Before I proceed to the review, you should know that personally I'm racing games addict and cars lover from kid. You should know that I raced in many online leagues in reputable simulator: rFactor - it could have been even 800-1000 driven hours. You may ask 'why have you stepped back to GRID?' - it's simple: I don't have time for preparations to compete in online leagues (1 race = whole week of training).     Here's where the GRID2 steps in! "
PROS: + Stunning graphics + Sound effects + Satisfying handling + Variety of modes  CONS: - Lack of cockpit view - Vehicle customization - Soundtrack - Microtransactions  VERDICT: 7/10
"If you like games like Burnout and Need 4 Speed. You might like this game. If you're expecting an experience along the lines of something like Forza or GT look somewhere else.   I myself can't hate this game enough. I hate everything about it. Codemasters feels the need to infuse GRID and DIRT with this huge amount of 'bro talk', MT DEW and fake pop culture. Which really just makes me sick. It's insulting.   The track line up is laughable as well. I can't think of anything positive to say about this game besides it's not for everyone. Some out there will find GRID 2 to be just what they need. The Burnout, and Need 4 Speed type of players. Nothing wrong with that.   I simply hate this game. The original GRID was so much more enjoyable and I was hoping to find that with GRID 2. That enjoyment was nowhere to be found for me."
"This review is focused on the singleplayer aspect of this game.  Pros:  - Fairly nice to look at - Good sound design - Bathurst - Decent length career  Cons:  - Handling inferior to the original GRID - I have seen better AI in N64 racing games - AI vehicles are also far stronger than player vehicle, which causes trouble with the high likelihood of AI colliding with player - Rubbing against a wall while turning a corner may result in a sudden outbreak of the Flips - No longer has the 'build your own racing team' style of the original, which I feel makes the game less appealing - Have to pay extra for Bathurst (and on that note, there is quite a catalogue of DLC which indicates that a decent amount of content was cut from the game for DLC, the same problem was had with DiRT 3.)  This is not really a bad game. However, it is inferior to its predecessor- your money would be much better spent on that.  Still could be worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of the series though."
"Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. I've been disapointed with this one. The graphics are improved and the damage model is still excellent. My problem is the handling and physics of the game. They just seem off. I spent most of the time starting out only drifting around turns (I hate drifting). Once I got it more figured out it got better but is still disapointing. Also not to mention that there is a lack of a cockpit view in the game. I got this game on summer sale for a great price and still feel like a wasted my money. There are better racing games out there if you are interested in buying one. I don't recomend this one unless you want to give it a try and don't have to spend much money on it.  UPDATE: So I don't believe many people realize what I'm trying to explain. So let me go into some more details. The game is beatuiful, amazing in looks. The damage looks real and the system for the career looks like it's great and laid out very well. The handling of the cars is what really turns me off from this. It's a cross between an arcade racer and a simulator. This compared to arcade racers is much harder and this compared to simulaters such as Gran Turismo is a joke. If you are willing to tweke settings and work on controlling the car perfectly its worth a buy but if you are just interested in jumping into a car and racing avoid it.  I like my simulators and Iike arcade racing games. Games like GRID 1, Forza, Gran Turismo, Burnout, Need for Speed all have pros and cons. Same with the game it has pros and cons. I tend to fall on a con side not liking this very much. I guess part is I was such a huge fan of GRID 1 that this one has changed so much I dislike it but I would rather play either a true arcade racer that I know what I'm getting or a true Simulator that I know how the car will handle. These crossover games that are an inbetween style I really don't like and hope they will fade out. If you try the game and like it great! If not it's probably a similar reason as me, it's not dedicated to one style of racing games it tries to hit both and misses the mark."
Fewer Disciplines Fewer Cars  Far more forgiving Flashbacks No sense of being in control of your own race company  The voice overs never shut up  No Cockpit view  No Odometre Samey races against dull opponents  Multiplayer with a completly pointless leveling system that ruins the fun.  So basically it is GRID 1 with almost half of its content removed. I will say it is very pretty and has the best sound design I have ever heard in a racing game.  Just buy GRID 1
"People are very critical with this game saying: - Controls are pretty arcade - You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move - It is not a true successor to GRID (1)  Actually: - Controls are pretty arcade - You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move - It is not a true successor to GRID (1)  So why I still recommend this game? Sure it is arcade and if you have ever driven a car with more than 200 HP than you will probably say this is bU11$h''+t. I have not done it before. So I can say in here it is so much fun. There are a lots of nice cars, from the street and from the racing tracks also. Driving really gives you the 'fast' feeling unlike other racing games (and yes here I meant NFS). Tracks are also nice (altough maybe some more would be better but it is still enough for a career game). Graphics are okay I guess, the effects are cool but there are some details when you feel that it could have been done nicer - maybe it was a price to pay to let older PCs also run this.   If you like fast cars and you do not mind some little mistakes and arcade-ness this game is just for you. Else you should go with a real sim."
"I anxiously awaited this game. For years I watched Codemasters release 'F1' and uninspiring 'Dirt 'titles waiting for a followup to the original Race Driver: Grid. When I finaly got my wish I found very little of the original GRID DNA. Tracks are gorgeous but few in number. Car control isn't as good as the original and it seems Codemasters has come down with a serious case of 'Need For Speed' -Itis. In other words, The game constantly pushes DLC and relies on a quirky multiplayer engine akin to EA's Autolog. The real problem is, that unless you pay to play you're not going to get very far in MP racing. The game is pale in comparison to the original and wasn't worth the wait IMHO."
I like when games tell stories through gampelay. GRID 2 at a first glance seems to be about racing and social media but it's actually a post-apocalyptic dystopia in which all the roads are covered in invisible ice.
"I think the biggest problem of this game is in it's name: if it wouldn't have been called 'GRID' it could get away with what it is. But people look at it and expect the experience they had with Racedriver: GRID, which this game doesn't deliver.  First of all, unlike Rd:Grid the game doesn't allow the player to customize his driving experience.  Rd:Grid was like 'you wanna play with keyboard? fine, here is a bunch of assists so you can handle the car with those keys. you get better at it, turn some of them off and get extra enjoyment!' or 'ofcourse a car would slide, but only if you are not carefull enough with the throttle in the exit of the corner. still cannot tame it? just move the TC slider a little bit backwards'. This freedoms resulted in great accessebility and immense fun of driving whatever you input device was.   Instead, GRID 2 says 'we got TrueFeel(tm), we have World SIDEWAYS Racing, we are all flashy and hooked up on fans which you gotta impress, so you are going to play the game OUR way!' Obligatory drifting. Oh gosh, i didn't think i ever see it this series. Thing is, you cannot tell if you are faster without it. It has become part of the game. Again, comparing to Rd:Grid, sliding the car was never an option if you were going to set a time. You would go for a clean line, resorting to sliding in rare instances, and yet it was fully up to the player. Sliding a corner made you feel 'Hahaha yeah!' or 'Oops, steady, steady!'. GRID 2 does it like 'Right, here we go again...'.  Not knowing all that, I jumped into it with my itching fingers ready over arrow keys and was for a surprise. 'OK, it won't be easy', i thought, and i got better at it, although still failing to have as much fun as i expected. But i kept my hopes up by thinking, 'OK, maybe if i get a controller, i might actualy get to enjoy it...'. WRONG. No ingame customization for controller device leaves it almost as clunky as keyboard. (to be fair there might be a way to make it better by editing xml file, but that's yet to find out). As it turned out, reading different forums, the game was desigined primarily for full-on steering wheel controllers, walking straight past keyboards and pads like they are history. Only a handfull of those hardcore devices seem to provide a player with full control over the car. Yet in a game, that positions itself as leaning towards arcade driving experience...  Another complaint is the track design. There are not a lot of tracks and locations to choose from. Racing tracks are alright. The trouble hides on city circuits and winding road courses. Like if half-♥♥♥♥♥ controls isn't enough, these end up being littered with hazards, things to hit or send a car flying off the road. Moreover, there simply isn't enough room for 12 hotheads to have their way through, making every game mode a demolition derby. This was not an issue in Rd:Grid.  Coupled with turtle-paced progression of multiplayer, which doesn't reward you for anything besides placing in top 3, you will soon find that if you can't enjoy the driving in this game, there is nothing else left to look for."
"GRID 2 tries to bring a sort of story element to its career progression. Longtime fans of Codemasters’ racing games might remember the TOCA Race Driver series implementing the same idea. In regards to GRID 2, it’s about one American billionaire called Patrick Callahan, who is launching a new franchise – World Series Racing (WSR) – and has noticed your dazzling skills in the game’s opening introduction race. From there, you become the material to promote WSR across the world and are given the challenge to bring more people to the sport. How do you do this? By beating all the other rivals around the world.An assortment of events populate each season in GRID 2. For example, the first season is set in America and involves racing from point A to point B, but then you move to season three, which is set in Asia and includes events like Touge and Drifting. Along the way you’ll also get to participate in elimination races and overtake challenges. It’s fantastic that the game is throwing a varied amount of events at the player. Making your way through the seasons introduces more powerful cars. Even though GRID 2 includes around 45 cars, it manages to cover a range of types.AI, for the most part, is good and feels to have been given an aggressive characteristic, as these racers aren’t afraid to grind metal with metal with the player. Codemasters has managed to pinpoint that line between realism and arcade racing, allowing anyone who enjoys racing games but isn’t into those that try to represent a serious realism of the sport to come to GRID 2 and get in with humble ease. Online multiplayer is great fun. Players can set up their own playlist of events and what cars to use. At first, the online is limited with its vehicle selection, since the online multiplayer has its own level-up system. Hitting a target level will unlock more cars, which you can then purchase with the earnings you get from taking part in race events online.GRID 2 is a fantastic looking game on the PC. The cars look great and tracks shine with plenty of details. Sound design is brilliant, with loud, roaring car engines blasting out, giving that sense of power coming from high-performance cars.The return of the GRID franchise isn’t as ground-breaking as I would have hoped, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great racer."
"GRID 2 REVIEW (long).: Our GRID 2 review delves into the is-it-arcade-or-is-it-sim racer and tries to stay on the road…    Crashing looks really good in GRID 2. Really good.  Which speaks volumes not only about the time and effort Codemasters has put into the near-pornographic squealing and deforming of metal when high-speed car meets wall but also the game itself. You’ll be crashing. A lot.  That’s because GRID 2 encourages an unhealthy dose of risk to go along with the speed. The handling is parked closer to arcade than simulation, so you can throw the backend of your car around corners at full speed while the tyres screech in pain. Powersliding is the best way to tackle corners but also leaves your car at great risk. Clipping anything mid-powerslide, whether it’s a barrier, rock or even an incline, will send your car spinning out or tumbling tyre over tyre down a ravine.  What’s annoying is that clipping other cars will have the same effect, sending you screeching off the road in fear while there's no apparent effect on the car you've just swiped. You can nudge opponents into barriers when the opportunity presents itself but that’s really as aggressive as you can be. Most manoeuvres are met with stiff resistance, as cars simply refuse to budge. It’s like slamming into a brick wall.  That’s fine – this is GRID 2 after all, not Burnout – except that AI cars hound racing lines so aggressively, you have to respect them and make way unless you want to risk being shunted into a barrier. It feels a little unfair.  GRID 2 – Arcade Or Simulation?  Flashbacks stop this from becoming too annoying. Though it’s not new to have a mechanic that allows you to rewind time, Codemasters has been unusually generous in granting you five Flashbacks to use during a single race. Perhaps it’s just as well. You’ll rarely spend them on correcting your own mistakes but rather, fixing the moments where you’ve been shunted by AI.  But this comes back to the original point – there’s an unhealthy dose of risk to go along with the speed, which is what makes GRID 2 fun. Powersliding around corners is satisfying thanks to the delicate level of control and it’s the threat of danger from obstacles or other cars that adds a perverse thrill, as you try and make it through unscathed. It’s dangerous, it’s exciting and GRID 2 that encourages you go faster, push your luck and take risks.  Will racing sim fans like it though? Probably not. Although there are simulation elements that come from the actual physics, crashes and weight of the car, this still feels like an arcade racer, with powersliding prompted from any tap of the brakes at high speed.  With no assists or settings to play around with, racing enthusiasts will be stuck with the arcade feel of the handling and just like auto-combos are frowned upon by fighting game fans, the abundance of Flashbacks doesn’t seem like it will sit well with racing game purists.  It's also - providing you learn how to tame powerslides and avoid all the obstacles and cars when drifting around corners - a fraction too easy.  But GRID 2 is an arcade racer, and makes few apologies for it. This feels like the closest an arcade racer can drift towards simulation without sacrificing any of the fun elements and although it’s a tricky balance, Codemasters has just about found it.  It helps that GRID 2 looks the part as well. The crashes are the obvious highlight for spectacle but more importantly, the stages look detailed and busy. The stages here don’t have the excess of Dirt Showdown, which packed empty sky with fireworks, ferris wheels and other decorations, and yet GRID 2 doesn’t really need them – urban stages have detailed buildings hiding the sky, forest stages dazzle you with light poking through the dense treetops while outdoor levels have cliffs on one side and vistas stretching out for miles on the other.    GRID 2 - Career  The majority of your time will be spent powering through the career mode. Codemasters has tried to make it feel more involving by building a rags-to-riches narrative, told through the number of fans you earn as you progress.   There are lots of nice tricks employed throughout to convey the sense of a race driver building up a reputation – off-screen YouTube footage of your replays, Likes being clicked on Facebook and so on. It does feel modern and adds a nice sense of style to the game, which extends to races themselves - small shunts have an understated effect that looks like camera distortion. It works better than we’ve made it sound.  But when all is said and done and the flashy cutscenes and tricks have played out, you’re still in a garage, picking races from a menu. It’s a little disappointing, truth be told. Even attempts to liven up the actual game modes themselves such as Endurance or Liveroute feel somewhat standard and pedestrian. There are also further annoying touches, such as the oddly patronising ‘well done pal!’ commentary and the lack of cockpit view.  It’s difficult to know exactly how Codemasters could push its well-worn racing game template forward without breaking it but this is a world that now has Forza Horizon, Need For Speed: Most Wanted and Gran Turismo 5 with their own distinct personalities and takes on career mode. GRID 2 has the style but not the substance. Career mode doesn’t feel special enough to stand out from the pack.  It’s a shame because the racing itself is surprisingly accommodating for those who aren’t dedicated petrolheads, thanks to its arcade-style powersliding, generous number of flashbacks to correct mistakes and the horrific yet compelling visual crunch of the (many) crashes.  It’s just the dedicated racing fans who might feel left out here, as the handling drifts closer to arcade than simulation and with no settings to redress the balance. GRID 2 is fantastic if you're not huge on racing games and want to experience the thrill of them without putting in the hours and yet that same lack of depth across career mode and the handling will be what puts the more serious racing fan off the title.  Score Breakdown: Graphics 8.5 / 10 Sound 7.0 / 10  Gameplay 8.0 / 10  Longevity 7.0 / 10  Multiplay 7.5 / 10  SCORE: 7.5 / 10   Final Verdict Accessible if a little shallow, GRID 2 has plenty of arcade racing fun for those who aren't too familiar with the genre but might disappoint hardcore racing fans thanks to the familiar career mode and lack of settings."
Great game.   Pros
"This is a fun arcade-racer that I have really enjoyed playing since I bought it back in September 2014, Some people like to base it off the original Grid, but this game is definitely has more of an arcade feel to it while Grid 1 I felt was more of a simulator. The Online Multiplayer Racing can be fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of the driving style that the game brings to the table and also when you make friends with a bunch of other respectable racers also... The sad things about the Online is that it is dying (I suggest you switch your download region on steam to London-UK to find more people) and there are those occasional hackers every now and then that can ruin the fun, but I enjoy the hell out of this game and playing with my racing buddies... I would recommend you buy this game when it is on sale, the $50 price tag for the reloaded edition is kind of expensive when you look at the age of the game. If you are an arcade racing game fan, I would recommend this game to you. I would believe you would enjoy this game."
"The biggest issue with GRID 2 (and GRID 1 to an extent) is how much of a realist are you? If realism and or simulation of how race cars really handle is important to you, then GRID 2 is the worst of the bunch.  A comparision I like to make on how the cars feel in Grid 2 is with Ridge Racer as the handling in GRID 2 follows the same overly eager grip that allows you to take a 90 degree turn at 120 mph.   While the realism of GRID 2 is no where as dumbed down as a title like Ridge Racer, it IS pretty basic.   If you have ANY experience in driving an automobile over 90 mph, then you will know that the cars in GRID 2 do not behave realistically at all.  Graphically the game is fine. Nice effects that don't bog my system down.  However, the gameplay and races themselves tend to get stale rather quickly.  Once you have raced a certain type of race don't expect to see much difference in setup, length or quality of the AI from race to race either. The AI doesn't 'get better' or any such luck, what you start with is what you get.  The multiplayer in GRID 2 is dead (in the US at least) and has been for a long time. I have yet to find one single multiplayer session located in the US and no one ever joined any sessions I created.  In the U.K. their seems to be a bigger following to non-oval type racing and so you can usually find more multiplayer options, but not many Steam users are willing to fiddle with Steam settings to get locked into U.K. race servers.  All and all, GRID 2 was a big step back in the series with features missing, or massive DLC to get the whole package required.  I hear GRID Autosport (Grid 2.5?) is a step back to the Grid 1 roots, but to be honest GRID 2 destroyed my faith in the GRID franchise to keep me away from any hope of liking it again anytime soon.  If you are looking for a good arcade racer, GRID 2 is fine in short bursts.  However, if you are the type to invest in a wheel and pedals and know the difference in how a car handles with or without automatic gear box, then I would stay away from GRID 2."
I ran over a rabbit (by an accident). Nothing happened and the rabbit kept happily running. 10/10 nature friendly
"According to some statistics made by the developers, they removed interior view since only like 30% used it and upon playing the game for a while you'll discover that was not the only thing they removed to save development cost and time.  Pro: - Good graphics. - Decent audio, apart from the obnoxious low frequency noises switching between menus. - Fun for a short while. - Damage model - Online demolition derby.  Cons: - Lack of interrior view. - Lack of any game music/theme. - No rear view mirror, you have to look back. - Extremely annoying slow animation transitions between menus, customisation..etc (aesthetics infavor of functionality) - Pure arcade car handling. - Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing. - Extremely annoying announcer everywhere with a sense of humor matching a cheesy car salesman, and unskipable. - Pay 2 win dlcs for online racing, as you get very few cars for online racing. - Rubberbanding AI.    Overall impression: meh... skip it. "
"While I enjoyed my time with GRID 2 (playing the campaign to completion), I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good example of a racing game. The odds in the game are pretty much stacked against you every which-way. If an opponent touches you your car will, nine times out of ten, spin out and you lose a ridiculous amount of ground. However, if YOU touch an opponent, you'll still receive the brunt of the damage and time lost. The AI relies wholly on rubber-banding too - drive badly, they will be more forgiving, drive well, and they'll go toe to toe with you. The gamemodes are generally enjoyable. The problem is how the game creates progression late-game. Instead of new tracks, the game simply extends old ones, or, by season 5, makes you do the same 6 mile course three times over. This wears thin quickly, and the endgame feels more like a grind than an edge-of-your-seat world championship. The game looks nice, the tracks are nice - hell, the cars are nice (if you're prepared to drop upwards of $5 to use the good ones). But when the actual gameplay is as infuriating as GRID 2 is, it really isn't worth your time/money - particularly at full price. I happpened across my copy in a Humble Bundle, and I'd be wary of paying any more than the $4 I shelled out for that bundle on this game alone."
"This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is more about drifting around corners than about finding the fastest racing line. It is almost like OutRun, you just are slower if you don't drift your way around corners. The rewind feature makes a return, further solidifying the arcade direction the series has taken with this sequel.  There is no cockpit view or car setup and tuning options are minimal and only available in multiplayer. Multiplayer may appear deserted and it does suffer from low population because of matchmaking regions being based upon your Steam download server's location. There is a lively multiplayer community, but to play with more people you need to change your Steam download region to UK - London and preferably also own all of the DLC packages to get better matchmaking.  In multiplayer your goal is to gain money and experience to level up to unlock new cars and upgrades which you then have to buy with the money you earned. Your multiplayer experience can be a mixed bag then in itself. In 'Playlists' there is no voting on game modes or choice of circuits, instead the lobby is assigned a random track, car tier and gamemode. Players then have the ability veto the combination once. If the combination is vetoed you are assigned another random combination without the ability to veto it. There is also the 'Custom Events' option which are events hosted by other players. You gain less money and experience from participating in 'Custom Events,' and only the lobby host can decide the settings of the event. The host has a wide variety of changeable settings, varying from type of event to forcing every player to use manual gears. There is a system called 'Impact Ratings' in the multiplayer, which shows other players how dirty their opponents race. These are represented by circles with exclamation marks in them, with the ranking going White-Green-Yellow-Red from the best to the worst. Players with too little data to assign them an 'Impact Rating' show as grey. The rating persists over races, and can change over time. Lots of online races tend to have people crashing into each other a lot, so do not pay too much mind to your 'Impact Rating.' When 'Impact Ratings' are enabled, you gain a small cash bonus at the end of the race based on your rating.  Also available in the Multiplayer menu are the 'Global Challenges.' These are a set of random events raced on certain circuits with either a certain Tier of cars or a specific car. Instead of racing head-to-head with another player, this game mode is leaderboard based. The game tracks your performance in the events and compares your scores to your friends. The person on the top of the leaderboard is considered to be leading the event. There are medals on the events, granting you small amounts of money and experience for passing their requirements. Based on your position on the leaderboard in the specific events you gain points for the overall leaderboard which shows who among your friends is the best racer overall. The set of events changes every few days with the leaderboards wiped at the same time.  The 'Singleplayer Career' mode casts you as the rising new talent in the fictional new racing series called World Series Racing or WSR for short. In the singleplayer you proceed through 'Seasons' of the series, completing events and unlocking new cars from challenges. As you progress through the career you gain access to more exotic cars, going from the old muscle cars and small European hatchbacks of Tier 1 to immensely powerful and rare cars like the Koenigsegg Agera R in Tier 4. The car selection has more of an emphasis on normal street legal cars rather than Touring Cars and the like. There is no Circuit de la Sarthe or the LMP class cars to be found in this game. The circuit selection varies from fantasy street courses to real life race tracks like Brands Hatch, Indianapolis and Yas Marina. Unlike the multiplayer, the cars are simply unlocked by completing separate challenges, and cannot be upgraded. The looks of the cars can be customised with paint colour, vinyls, wheels and sponsorship logos. The sponsors also have specific challenges for you to complete. Your progress throughout the career is tracked by the amount of 'Fans' you have. You gain fans from completing sponsor objectives and placing well in events. The 'Fans' statistic is hidden in Codemasters' 'Racenet' service in the multiplayer, and has no real effect on that part of the game.  I don't like how the AI can nudge your car around but you really can't do the same to them. I played the game mostly on Medium difficulty, and it is easy if you just race very physically, using the other cars to navigate corners. The AI gets really challenging on Hard and becomes a far more frustrating experience. In my opinion there is noticeable gap in the AI skill between Hard and Medium that really shows in the way they react to you driving aggressively.  Graphically GRID 2 looks very impressive. The crashes look nice with parts flying off and shrapnel scattering all over. The stages look nicely detailed: urban stages have detailed buildings surrounding you as you race down the streets. Forest stages look threatening with hills and dense forest just outside the track, ready to punish from the slightest mistakes with formidable damage. The game is also very well optimised and runs well even on older hardware. Sounds are probably the weakest part of the game, with similar engine sounds for most of the cars and a very annoying tire squeal sound effect. There is also the sound of crowds cheering, but beyond that ambient sounds are nonexistent.  Grid 2 is a solid arcade racer with great graphics, but is sadly hamstrung by its emphasis on drifting over real racing lines, stagnant AI and multiplayer which frequently devolves to a demolition derby. Fans of more arcade racing games like the Need For Speed series will find much to like here, while fans of the more realistic approach of the first game should give this game a pass."
  About GRID 2
"Grid 2 is nothing groundbreaking, but it's still a great racer. Let me sum some things up for you:  + Beautiful environments, great graphics + You get to choose which car you want to drive; freedom of choice. + Objectives give the races variety + Not quite an arcade racer...  - Lack of diversity in tracks - No cockpit view - And yet not quite a sim...  [Rating: 77/100]"

"I wasn't sure if I could recommend it or not. The game can be fun, but it might be frustrating either.  First of all: the sngle player mode. Basically your goal is to beat Harrison Carter (a bot), who always finishes first or second (if you're first). The rest of bots is always drunk so don't even mind them. A car driven by AI which is in front of you is always slower than you. It can't drift, never puts pedal to the metal. Is it easy to overtake them? Of course not. The roads are usually so narrow that you're usually blocked by AI cars. If any other car touches yours or you touch it, you'll instantly spin out so don't even try to crash the bots. And here goes the magic! Whenever a car driven by AI is behind you, it starts driving like a pro: never uses break, never reduces speed, never touches anything (and if so, its car isn't damaged at all). It overtakes you in a moment and then it becomes the slow one again. Oh and the best thing, you always starts from the second to last position so have fun with being blocked by cars in front of you and being bumped by cars behind you.  The multiplayer is totally unfair. Guy who starts from better position (especially the first and the second) has always a huge adventage. If he is as good as you, and has a good car you have no chance to overtake him. Also there isn't really any punishment for attacking others so feel free to be a ♥♥♥♥ and keep on hitting any car you want. Multiplayer is fun when you play with your friends (unless they play fair)."
"Good graphics, decent car list. That about sums up the positives.  The physics, oh boy. To be quick, you have to drift, which in itself goes against ANY logic, at least on tarmac. And the way you drift is moronic as well- the car just steps out, no matter what you do. If you try driving sensibly, you understeer like you're running bald summer tires in snow. If you don't want to do so, you have to drift, but how can you do it properly when throttle control basically doesn't exist? It just boggles my brain that a game of this pedigree can handle worse than Mario Kart 64.  This is the worst driving game I own by far. I regret spending 6EUR on it, even though it was in a bundle. Speaking of which, can you refund Humble Bundle games?"
"+ Calling by name is amazing feature more games should have. Even losing is fun, Damaging is arcade-like, I popped a tire, came last and it was most entertaining loss I had. It's well optimized, runs with unbelivable framerate, explains developer's name Split-screen! Haven't seen that for ages. Might be able to drive both cars some day... Uses gamepad's vibration really well - rare game where I felt it was in-context all the time. Switches out of full screen into small borderless window upon Alt+Tab - why it's not in every game?  +/- Controls are very sensetive, makes it challenging to start from medium difficulty, so I had to switch to 'very easy' to finally advance.  - Online community is hiding somewhere. Racenet seeems useless in comparsion to NFS' Autolog, everyone wants to make an account out of me."
"As someone who is brand new to racing games (less than 10 hours in), and played with a controller as opposed to a racing wheel take my review for what it is; a new players perspective.   As someone brand new to the genre, and the series I really enjoyed this game from the start, It wasn’t hard to start; however as I left easy mode the game offered more rewards and challenges.  The visuals are simply amazing, and the game play is very solid.   The Good  * Amazing graphics * Very good gamepad compatibility, would like to find a good wheel that is compatible withthis game.  * Game is a lot of fun. * Naive 144hz monitor resolution support.     Needs Improvement  * Takes a while to find a match online at non peak hours.     Overall Rating   10 / 10"
"Dear God, what have you done to GRID? Still insisting on finishing it as a fan, halfway through season 2 I realized they must've said something like ''Lets not bother with putting actual damage mechanics, simulation aspects from the original game, cockpit view etc, but instead, lets give the cars absurd physics and call it a simulation''.  No matter which difficulty setting you're playing on (tried all), your car is your biggest opponent. It will constantly try to spin no matter what you do, just staying on the road is a challenge and it gets better and better when an opponent actually 'touches' your car, no matter which position, no matter what speed, say hello to the wall over there.  I'll probably finish it for the sake of achievements and completion but hell, doing it with a vw golf because it's one of the few cars that manages to stay on the damned road is a shame...  Screw graphics, go buy the original GRID, still beats this one."
"If you really must pick one between Grid Autosport and Grid 2, go for Autosport to avoid all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arcade drifts. In truth though I don't really recommend any of these 2 games since both failed to recapture the magic of the handling physics in Grid 1"
"First GRID was better, don't bother with this."
"TLDR at the bottom.  I came into this expecting a better and updated Grid 1, a worthy successor to a pretty decent (although flawed) racing game.  What i got was a chineese bootleg of need for speed. Grid 1's physics though quirky and in dire need of a few small fixes have been thrown completely out the window in favour of some simplified super arcady system that bears no resembelance of realism to the first one.  Grid 1's cars had a 'points rating' for performance 4/5 5/5 ect. This is not a very good system but in Grid 2 they have moved to an even worse system where each stat of performance is a bar. This makes comparing cars virtually impossible. not to mention the majority of cars share the same statline.  the cutscenes are cringeworthy, They strike right into the heart of the 'old white man trying to appeal to young kids of the digital age' as if the game is almost a parody of itself. The ESPN sections are especially cringeworthy, i wonder how much their paid for licensing to an american only complay for an american live action cutscene THAT IS UNSKIPPABLE.   Atleast they have done away with the horrible sponsor screen from GRID 1. that would take way too long to scroll. Grid 2 allows you to skip alot of parts.  Pros: More cars Updated Graphics Post-Race Sponsor rundown  Cons: Physics is terrible unskippable cringeworhty cutscenes Physics are awful AI is on rails &amp; cheats  The game is legitimately not fun to drive in. By far the worst event is the random track events without a co-driver or minimap its a random chance that a corner is a hairpin or open. you have to take every corner at slow speed. Alot of other events are 1-3 laps meaning you have no time to learn the circuit at all.    TLDR: its not Grid 2. Its bootleg need for speed. If you like the NFS series. enjoy if you wanted a successor to Grid1. youre SOL."
Pros:  + Gorgeous Visuals + Lengthy Campaign + Unique car design + Environment variety + Car Damage + Relaxing soundtracks + Sound Effects + Every bump feels realistic + Flashback ability + Fast Loading  + Multiplayer  Cons:  - Sometimes feels repetitive - Less number of players online - AI is dumb at times - No cockpit view  9/10
"Before buying the game be aware of what Codemasters Customer Services says: 'This version of the game does not officially support Windows 10' and 'We have no plans for a Windows 10 patch'.   The game runs like a charm on my PC, but it crashes to Windows desktop every 3-5 minutes, often in a middle of a race series. I've tried all the guides community post all over the internet on this problem and none of them help. And with no help from tech support, I guess I've just poured my money to drain."
"Codemaster, SHAME ON YOU!!! There are more DLC than game modes !! 53 £ for a complete game!! Such a disappointment... Grid WAS in the top 10 'most fun games'..! Gone! SHAME ON YOU!"
"Its a very good game though for me not as good as the Grid One was. I just like more simulation than it's in this part. The grid one gave a choice in multiplayer. This one does not. Anyway, playability is still very good, competition and player development makes it almost imposible to stop playing the effect 'just one more race' is definitely there, then you become a new car and have to test it and so on. Easy to play, hard to master. And nobody should be angry that it is not an Gran Tourismo or a Forza. Graphics 7/10, Sound 8/10, Gameplay 9/10. Arcade 70% Simulation 30% Gameplay isnt the most important thing for me but I give it a nine out of 10 score because of the DLC politics."
"Well, Codemasters, I have been racing with you since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, V8 Supercars 2 and now in the present: coming from F1-2010 to 2013 I felt like a change, and decided over Dirt 3 that I buy Grid 2. First I will start with the cons.   -Firstly, NO DRIVERS CAM? What kind of racing game doesn't have that!? Even Colin Mcrae which was a 2000s' era game had it! I get the feeling this isn't a simulation game but more of an arcade.  -Secondly yes the realism. The damage model is excellent, smashing into things has never been so fun. But lacks, tire wear and rain? Can't change car setups in career mode unless its hidden? I have looked. -Thirdly Racenet... I am logged in, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out why my times don't show on the friend scoreboard in career mode, I have tried logging out and back in but no cigar. As a competitive racer, I is sad about this. -Lastly the price of the All In DLC is way too expensive for a game which is now dead. By dead I mean, I cannot find a single online race. I won't waste money on unlocking cars I cannot use.  OK now for the pros! -Firstly I'm more of a grippy guy so seeing a variety of cars is great! I get such a rush from using the Caterham, it grips so well and it flies.  -The graphics are beautiful and at max settings I never dip below 60fps -The career mode. What can I say, an immersive story in which you are a racer working up through the ranks with goodies like unlocking cars watching the protagonist gain social media attention and fans, The AI provide a challenge even though I have yet to lose a race or even finish second (Hard difficaulty, damage on, flashbacks on)  My conclusions is, as a racing fan who always leaned towards Formula One, it was nice to get back to actual road cars. Please remember this is my review, my opinion. I'm sure you think differently and you will let me know in the comments."
"Exceptional bad mechanics. Every single car drifts, making it totally unpleasant. The worst part is the abysmal AI of the cars, taking racing lines regardless if you are taking the line and then there is the factor that any car can bump you off track. They bump into your backside and you spin, you bump into their backside and you spin.   All in all this is a poor game which I received as a gift and won't spend a penny on.   "
"This is probably one of the best, if not the best, racing games on Steam. Sure, the graphics are maybe a year or two behind, but the game was released in 2013. That being said, I think that it still stands up to newer games like Forza. Every once in a while this game goes on sale for next to nothing. That means that anyone can afford it if they wait for the perfect opportunity. If you want a realistic driving simulator, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a great driving game with an incredibly vast on-line mode and a story mode worth playing, it's all right here. I like it. I think you'll like it."
"- DLC bloated. Sometimes, from 10 cars you COULD use, 8 come from DLCs. - Annoying, long, cheesy cut-scene sequences - Drifting worse than GRID (1) - Bad bots are too bad, leading bots are too good. You always start at the end, and you have to mow through all the bad bots, who are simply road block for you. After you've done that, you have to chase down those bots, who HAPPEN to start at the front every single time. Gets pretty annoying after some time."
The game rips control of the car out of your hands every time you turn. Probably the absolute worst ♥♥♥♥ you could do in a racing game.
  Grid 2 is definitely better than GRID 1.   Awesome Soundtrack   The handling is very good for an arcade game and the graphics are amazing!  
"Many gamers use cheats ,this game is not for serious racers  When I compare this game to TOCA games , you can kick cheaters and rammers off the game  Will think hard before I spend my money on a code master game again. I have all the code master race games up to Grid 2 When you buy a game you should be able to be competetive to the end with out spending more money to buy cheats to get extra speed or grip  Have no problem winning up grades as you progress  Thanks Andrew"
"GRID 2 is a OK racer for the price   IS THE GAME WORTH IT? The game is oke for a price under 10 dollar/euro more than that and you will regret your purchace.   the game was pretty much dead but with the free weekend new life was blown in the multiplayer. the hadeling model is oke, and the fact that there is no in car view can be lived with. i hope as the game is free for a weekend that racers will apricatie the game and see it's potention.  PROS - good single player - good looking graphics - controller support    CONS - to much micro transactions - multiplayer is pretty dead - handeling pretty bad - little cdustomization  the game is a 7/10"
Pretty much the closest thing to Forza on the PC in terms of gameflow and the simulation to arcade ratio.
"9/10 -Great sense of speed and collection of cars. The damage system is spectacular and racing your friends is always fun. All the cars handle like a dream. The engines sound like the real thing. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the game doesn't have a cockpit view (inside the car) and you can't upgrade or tune your car in anyway in singleplayer but you can customize your ride like change rims, tire size, colors and decals. Multiplayer on the other hand you can tune your car making it faster. I hate how this game has so much DLC because if you own a certain DLC and your friend doesn't you can't play it with them making that new DLC useless unless you want to play it by yourself. Overall it's the best street racing game I ever played but just short of perfect."
- Sexy cars - Sexy graphics - Sexy environments - Sexy gameplay  Overall: Sexy
"I played through single player with my Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. I didn't try playing it with a controller, but I do know that this game is designed to be controller friendly.  I found this game to give a really fun racing experience without being punishingly difficult or realistic. Unlike games that are designed to be simulations first, it really feels like GRID 2 is designed to be a fun game first.  The fun comes from a few things.   First of all, the racing does really feel 'intense' - this comes through thanks to all the great visuals and sounds. It's not easy to describe, but there's just loads of polish on the overall aesthetic. The wide variety of levels and locations really helps here as well.  Second of all, they have lots of little ways to prevent you from getting frustrated. My favorite mechanic is the flashback mechanic - it basically lets you rewind time to undo a mistake you made. This is really great because not only does it prevent you from going 'oh no, I need to restart the whole race...', it also gives you the opportunity to learn much more quickly. There's a limit to how many times you can do this so it doesn't make the game too easy. Furthermore, they have a wide range of difficulty settings for all levels of experience. I have only played a few racing games and found the Easy difficulty to be decently challenging without being frustrating. Finally, they have this guy who is talking to you all the time who will ocassionally offer useful suggestions and keep you focused on what to do during a race (and it doesn't get annoying, in my opinion).  Third, the overarching story of trying to get fame for the WSR feels like a pretty significant goal. There's lots of different ways you can advance the story (for example, if you don't like a particular type of event you can focus on other types of events).  My major issue with the game is that, towards the fourth WSR series, I felt like the content was becoming a bit same-y and it started to feel like a bit of a grind.  Overall, if you are interested in having a fun racing experience as a change from a hardcore, realistic racing sim, this game is pretty fun. I haven't played many other PC games in the genre, though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt."
"  GRID 2 is a half-simulator, half arcade style racer that is a genuine balance between both styles of racing genre and can be categorised in a league of its own in terms of car handling and circuit design. Interior view has been removed from the original GRID which is disappointing as I feel that this camera view adds authenticity to a racing game, even if it is rarely used, I would’ve liked to switch views mid-race to know that my driver was steering the car. The music being added at climatic points in each event adds immersion in the racing experience, unlike games such as Forza or Gran Turismo which have static tracks played all race. This game is a minor step down in drifting compared to GRID 1, however city circuit tracks for regular racing seem to have a realistic transition between brick, asphalt and kerbs unlike the games predecessor.  Codemasters has created World Racing League ‘WCR’ were your job is to race a variety of racing clubs from the US, Middle-East, Europe and Asia to attract ‘fans’. The inclusion of ESPN a well-known sport commentating channel in the US adds a layer of mirrored fame found in real life and adds depth in the single player experience, which helps new players to the genre engage in this racing game. The addition of displaying short story clips of your racing fame across YouTube, the WSR in game website and SMS messages motivates you to aim for a greater number of fans. While story typically lacking in racing games, Codemasters has pulled of a story mode that doesn’t ruin the experience of racing or feel that there is any difficulty in progressing to the next race as skipping events is optional. As you near completion of a race, overtaking a threat (another popular driver), complete a race or experience damage issues your crew chief will annoy you which adds to the enjoyment of the game but gets repetitive as you progress through the game. Throughout the game the same tracks, modes and simular challenges were reused however the difficulty of driving a faster vehicle in the later stages of the game compensates for this. Codemasters could pull some of the officially licenced world class circuits from the F1 series into Grid 2.  In short the singleplayer provides a decent range of content despite the large amount of additional content and will give at least 24 hours of gameplay in the base game*, additional tracks including the extravagant demolition derby has been brought from GRID 1 in a free DLC which is brilliant for local multiplayer fun with friends and family. The demolition derby features only one car to choose from that is kitted out just for demolition events which you can select in the quick race menu for single or multiplayer modes. It was disappointing that Grid 2 features the same tracks as its predecessor, which feels like Codemasters reworked the handling of the vehicle in this mode to be significantly easier to control, making it harder to slide out.   *Please do note that I have played this game for console on release week. *  In GRID 2 online unlike the ‘WRS’ singleplayer mode you can purchase and upgrade vehicles performance. The new rivalry mode allows users to set up randomly assigned online players which compete for XP to crown the ‘better racer’, this mode I feel is underused at the time of writing this review but is a great feature that I believe GRID should integrate with the main multiplayer mode of future titles. There is also a global challenge that ranks your account on various tracks against world times and a full featured online mode which has typical lobby matchmaking as you would expect. With some interesting indicators for racers which prefer to drive aggressively indicated by traffic light colour exclamation marks next to their profiles. Also by purchasing the DLC you get no advantage over users who have not purchased the DLC other than the specific vehicle, and all tiers are able to be used from the start in multiplayer however if you want more cars they need to be purchased unlike the singleplayer. Grid 2 is a graphically enhanced GRID 1 with several race types such as checkpoint, time attack, endurance, face off, drift, touge, races that change each lap and regular races found in the single payer as well as the multiplayer.   GRID 2 is a well-priced game to buy standalone during a sale event, do not be pressured to purchase the DLC’s on offer for this title as the content is not worth what you pay for. The free DLC of demolition derby is to be expected as it features the same tracks and cars from the previous title, but I found that the gameplay was more enjoyable for the demolition derby races than in the original GRID. The lack of cockpit view is a major letdown and detracts the simulation aspect found in the previous title. Both GRID 1 and 2 are great games and if you prefer a more Arcady family and friend gaming experience than GRID 2 is the game of choice out of the two which is an easy game to get into for beginners. Overall GRID 2 is a brilliant game that can be set apart from the previous title in ways, however there has been key gameplay features removed and missed from the original game.  *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*"
"I tried this when it was a demo, and didn't like it then. I got this only as part of a humble bundle, and I still don't like it. Let me tell you why.  -crappy controls -DLC required for full unlocks of progress in main game -crap AI opponents who slow down if you make mistakes and ride your rear if you don't -solo ho-hum hum drum craptastic racing experience  Skip it. You can find better for free. Much better."
"This game is not really an improvement over Race Driver: GRID, except for the graphics. This game has a number of defects including:  - No cockpit view (apparently because of 'memory constraints'. Really? This is a PC game, right?) - A high chance of having zero multiplayer which still hasn't been fixed after 8 months - Cheaters in multiplayer if you are lucky enough to have it - DLC is pretty bad, seemingly just content ripped from release so you can pay extra - DLC shown during any car select so it feels like you're playing a demo  The physics are er, ...interesting. It's very drift friendly - perhaps for the younger generation - and sometimes I like this and sometimes it seems my car breaks into a slide purely at random.  Singleplayer - Seems to be 90% city courses so far (I'm most of the way through tier 3) with only the occasional time trial on decent real world circuits, which might be quite a disappointment for Race Driver: GRID fans. The much hated Codemasters D0uchebag™ is alive and present in singleplayer, sounding like an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot blabbering on about social media ... I want to punch that fool. Fortunately you can tun him off which is a massive improvement over Dirt 3, where you are forced to listen to the fūckwit tell you to 'upload your video to youtube!!11!1!!'.   Only things it's got going for itself is the graphics and the damage modelling. If you're looking for a sequel to GRID I suggest you look at Shift 2 Unleashed, even for all it's problems it's far superior to this."
"One of the best racing games I have ever played!  Really nice gameplay, cars, controls, graphics. Also runs amazing on laptop chips :) The story mode is great and the multiplayer is fun too, the only dowside can be the car styling but its not a big deal.  You should really consider geting this if you are a fan of racing games but also if you like games with 'speed', like going really fast. It really feels like you are in the car in this game and to be honest it feels great!  This game is also very realistic on the crashes, it really looks like a real car that has been damaged.  Is ths game worth buying at full price? Yes it is!  Will it run on a older pc? Yeah it will, actually runned at medium/high settings on my laptop.  1-10? 9/10 :)"
"A big disappointment, particularly compared to the first GRID. While the UI and the conceit are cool, the game is disgustingly crammed with DLC. How disgusting? The cars that 'count' as DLC are DIFFERENT between the single player and online versions of the game. Also, it doesn't work with my racing wheel (a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro) which did work with the original game. Playing it with a Xbox gamepad just isn't the same.  On a possitive note, the racing *feels* very fast, and the maps are good, particularly the country road ones. So if you value feeling fast over anything else, this might be the racing game for you."
"It's a solid game, with beautiful graphics, scenery and the sound effects are very good, but it feels mainly 'arcadeish', good for people bad in driving games (myself included). The game however has settings that add more manual handling control to the user, but the gameplay itself lacks realism. The game main campaign might look interesting for the first few races, but then it gets too repetitive, every time it's the same venues, the tracks are just slightly different from one another when racing in the same place or are exactly the same you played on before, very poor variablility. Also, some events are ultra repetitive as you have to run in the same track over and over, and do not add anything different to the gameplay.  The multiplayer part of the game is fun at first, but levelling up was taking a lot of time and made me lose interest on keeping racing on every same track all the time. Also finding a lobby with a lot of people is not an easy task, maybe this can vary with the region of the world. The good part about the multiplayer is playing with friends and laughing about the mistakes and crashes.  One thing very annoying is shoving in your face the 'add-on' cars (DLC) when you go to select your car to play. Add-on cards should only be shown if I had the cars, not telling me to purchase them. If you want to advertise it in the game, make it so in the main menu... By the way, they added a 'Reloaded' edition, which is just the same base game with all the DLC included in a single package, another way to milk more money out of DLC.     --------  Portuguese translation:  O jogo é bem feito, tem belos gráficos, cenários e efeitos sonoros são muito bons, mas o jogo é muito arcade, bom para o público geral que não joga bem jogos de corrida (eu incluso nisso). Porém o jogo permite configurações que permitem maior controle manual por parte do jogador, mas mesmo assim o jogo não prima em realismo. A campanha principal do jogo é interessante no início, principalmente nas primeiras corridas, mas daí em diante se torna repetitivo demais, são sempre nas mesmas cidades, os circuitos mudam muito pouco mesmo quando o modo de corrida muda, muitas vezes são os mesmos circuitos/traçados, a variedade é bem fraca. Os eventos em si também são bem repetitivos, muitas vezes você tem que correr na mesma pista várias vezes, e nada de diferente é adicionado à jogabilidade.  O modo multiplayer é início no começo, mas subir de level parece muito lento e me fez perder o interesse em jogar online nos mesmos circuitos de novo toda hora. Encontrar uma sala com muita gente também não é tarefa muito fácil, de repente falta jogador se for dividido por região. O legal do multiplayer é jogar com amigos e rir dos erros e batidas.  Uma coisa bem chata é ficar mostrando toda hora os carros 'add-on' (DLC) quando você vai selecionar o seu carro pra corrida. Esses carros opcionais só deveriam ser mostrados caso o usuário tivesse a DLC, não ficar toda hora mostrando que pode comprar, é irritante. Se quer fazer propaganda faça no menu inicial... A propósito, eles lançaram uma versão 'Reloaded' que nada mais é do que o mesmo jogo com todas as DLCs inclusas num pacote, outra forma incentivar a prática caça-níquel de DLCs."
I love Downhill Mizu Mountain Okutama !!!!!!
"Grid 2 is yet another racing game from arcade racing specialists Codemasters and make no mistake, this is no simulation. Racing is centred around street circuits, permanent racing venues and a few single stage like events.    There is a wide variety of events available from straight races, time trials, checkpoint races, endurance (7 whole minutes at a time!), drift, eliminator and others. The best of these is the “liveroutes” events that occur in one of the major cities. The route is randomly chosen when you start a race and the mini-map is disabled resulting in you having to pay attention to the upcoming corner to judge entry speed. Though once you have been playing the single player portion of the game for a while it does become easier as the locations while appearing huge are quite limited in how many layouts are available.   The game is absolutely beautiful though, from the various locations like Paris, Hong Kong and Barcelona to all the car models and how damage appears on them. The game also performs admirably on even modest machines.  My biggest issue with the game is how the cars drive and more importantly how the AI cars drive. Cars come in two varieties, tail happy and not, that's about it. Front wheel drive cars drive like front wheel drive cars, four wheel drive cars are glued to the road and for rear wheel drive it's seemingly random whether it's glued to the road or wants to head for the bushes at every corner. This behaviour tends to drive you to only driving a couple of cars like the Caterham LMP-like track car the Audi R8 LMS.  The opposition AI is also an issue. Instead of allowing the AI to drive the track and react to conditions and you as they appear, the AI cars seem to be pre-programmed to move around the track in a certain way like robots. It's frustrating in many ways as you end up making the same passes all the time as you quickly become aware of their weaknesses. There are also some bizarre changes in difficulty, some races are ridiculously easy on the highest setting while others are quite hard on the lowest. Both these criticisms could be made of just about every Codemasters racing game, maybe with the next Dirt or Grid they could concentrate on AI?  All in all this is a very decent Arcade racer, it doesn't do anything new or exciting that is deserving of paying full price, but is a good way or wasting a few hours here and there."
At first i disliked this game it felt to floaty to control this was mostly because of there being no cockpit view however after a couple of minutes looking on the internet i found a mod that fixes this i now love this game.   http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/cockpit-cam-mod.346/updates  ^^^that is the link to the mod^^^
"Game is not worth it. Anything made good in this game is lost by the fact that every AI car in the game are on rails that are harder to break than Wolverine's Bones. You can not race against them without constant annoyance. They will push and shove you out of their way like your car is made out of paper cups and they are titanium. That is on any difficulty. I would recommend Dirt3 but that is a no go as well, as it can not save. It is a dark day for driving games, a dark day indeed."
"starts ok but cars are ridiculously loose at the rear end, and become undrivable like a real car as they get faster, and the sensitivity of the throttle doesnt seem to work if you are using pedals.  "
this game SUCKS Ai crashes on you and your car goes flying. Feels like you are never in control. Induces RAGE
There aren't many racing games where I can't at least drive straight.
"In my opinion, the game is worth it if it's under $20. I've been a active racer for this game since day one. I've preordered it on Steam because it had the best DLC bundle compared to the console counterparts. The only DLC packs that matter are the mclaren pack, the mercedes pack, and the gt-r pack in my opinion. Since there were a lot of folks that pre-ordered it too, you'll be able to use those cars on a regular basis in the public lobbies. Both the Mclaren and Mercedes DLC cars for TIER 4 are the ONLY upgradeable ones. You can not upgrade any other DLC cars. Also, the GT-R pack is good because it gives you a good option to be competative in Tier 3 when you are starting out as a low level driver.  As far as multiplayer goes, just make sure you set your download region to a European server (since the game is region-locked). If you are looking forward to drift mode like the one from GRID 1, then be prepared to be let down. Because of the new physics engine, it's nothing like it's predecessor. But I like the racing portion a lot though. The reason why I liked the GRID 1 was because all the cars had the SAME SPECS. So the only thing that defines the winner is skill and the racing lines the driver takes to get to the top. With the upgrade customization aspect thrown into the mix in GRID 2, it's now about which setup get's you the best performance in the car along with what lines you take. As you meet faster racers, you'll learn what are the best setups for the best car in each tier or, for me, the best setup for your driving style. Add in the 'active obstactle' for the mental game of how are you going to pass this racer cleanly for an extra challenge. Also, if you are pretty confident in your skills and are in a room full of noobs, you can challenge yourself by giving the noobs a 10 second head start.   http://youtu.be/EyZzJkx4_6U   When I mention 'active obstacles' I'm of course referring to the dirty racers/rammers in multiplayer.    http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOQL5fqmN3d40Z2d8rCGHfWp6aeEGlEB   So if you are looking to find some close races   http://youtu.be/WL12RNeSp98   or test your skills in dodging pile ups    http://youtu.be/NqYkR88q4Uc   and clean overtaking   http://youtu.be/RPTpXhpjGSE   Then I look forward to seeing you on the track."
"Although, It really is ALOT of fun to play, The truth of the matter is, the game have major flaws.... The game saves becoming corrupted, I believe that was done by CM on purpose, just to sell the unlock pack to all the frustrated racers who would have to race with none of the cool unlocked cars. Then they 'fixed' it. So now, my gamesave file is corrupt again, and there is no way to fix it. Well, the 68.00 + tx I spent on this game thus far, seems to be wasted money.. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  When I complained on a thread made by one of the developers re: VAC being intigrated into GRID 2, I fired of a comment 'Are you going to corrupt our gamesaves, and sell us VAC like u did with the UNLOCK PACK.?' Now, before I posted, comments were coming in at around, 1 per 4 to 5 hours. 10 mins after I posted, 15 comments in 10 minutes, and NOT 1 had anything to do with my comment. The next morning.  Codemasters deleted the tread, and moved all feedback to the forums, so they can instantly edit out comments that they dont like. And I know this sounds paranoid, But my gamesave didnt corrupt for the 2nd time, until I posted a VERY similar comment on a steam freinds profile.    I am openly and publicly calling CODEMASTERS out. YOU SCAMMED US, AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!!!!  -the worst part is. I really liked that game.    Id recommend D/L a torrent, You wont have multiplayer, but with the gamesave issue, your only saving yourself the heart ache of losing all your work, and just when it get good, the game save corrupts..."
"I have not played a lot of racing games on pc, but I can say Grid 2 is one of the best I have tried. I hear a lot of complaints about it being not realistic enough, but for me that's just fine (after all my favorite racing series is the F Zero series). I have not played its predecessor but I can say that I do enjoy Grid 2 quite a bit. I am having trouble putting into words what I like about Grid 2, after all I cant even describe what sets it apart from other racing games. I can say however, that I have not noticed anything 'wrong' with the game per se. It ran good for me, it was easy to learn, and it was fun to play, and in the end, are those not the most important aspects of a game? I cant tell you why you should be interested in Grid 2, but if you are a fan, you've got to at least give it a look. I cant guarantee you wont be disappointed. But you will never know until you try."
"Want a good racing game? Get original GRID, want a game you won't be able to complete unless you buy all dlc, get this! It's easier than original was, and yet it feels harder, almost all cars you get trough career are drifters (even the ones that really shouldn't be) So you will have a really hard time finishing some races without buying a good dlc pack :("
An arcade racing game. Great damage simulation. Yet another racing game tells you that drift is way better than grip.  娱乐爽快的赛车游戏，里面的车损系统一直是我喜欢grid系列的原因之一。游戏里面漂移比抓地过弯快，所以必须得漂移╮(╯_╰)╭......
"Don't get me wrong, this game had potential but just has some major issues that make it almost unplayable.  - Handing  The cars handle like complete crap and are either boaty as ♥♥♥♥ or so sensative you can't drive in a straight line. The cars spin so freaking easily and its impossible to overcome a spin or control it. If you so much as touch someone, you spin, if you touch a wall you spin, if you do anything you spin. Trying to drift is nearly impossible, as soon as you start to slide, it's like a bar of soap sliding on the bottom of a wet bath tub. Honestly phone racing games have better handling this. 3/10  - Performance  I don't know if this is my own fault, or what but after playing the game for 10 hours the performance decided to jump off a cliff and I know it's not me playing on a weak PC, I play Shift 2 above 60 fps no issue at all on max. If it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, the graphics would be really good. 4/10  - Difficulty  I don't want to play a game that is so easy you dust everyone, but damn its nearly impossible to win even if the game didn't have the ♥♥♥♥♥iest handling ever. If all of the AI have the same car as you, they are still way faster in all ways despite them owning the EXACT same car as you. It makes winning more of a hassle than fun, you end up restarting the event over and over again until either you wreck one of the AI or they do something stupid and you get extremly lucky. 2/10  If you want a nice looking track racing game, just get Shift 2, it's a lot better and cheaper, you even get all the DLCs for free."
"I wouldn't recommend this game to any one after finishing the career mode.  So this is the 2nd of the GRID series. It has better music and better graphics. A race in Algave on a sunny day is really beautiful. A richer car list than GRID, including those breathtaking racing cars and those flashing super or hyper car. The idea of WSR is also great, getting drivers from all over the world, from different clubs, having different driving style to race rogether is great fun.  But seriously, because you're the post boy of WSR, and your job is to attract those racers to take part in WSR, you'll have no chance to take part in 24h Le Mans. And for this you're saying goodbye to those stunning prototypes, which is a great lost for me. Well they left me a SP300R though.  So since I won't recommend this game to anyone else, how imperfect it is? Well, the career mode, I'd devide it into three parts, the boring part I like a game of NFS, the best second part and the total nightmare of the third part. Why is that? The cars in this game are divided in to three types: grip, balanced and drift. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem is, GRID2 didn't have a right idea of drfting, and made drfting literally spinning. It's alright at first, when your cars are always slow so you can remain in control. But that makes it feel like NFS. When you're going into Europe, grip type of cars appear. You'll find them funny to drive, with sometimes a little bit of slide, you'll have a lot of fun in driving. But when it comes to the later part of the game, especially when you have those Tier 4 super car. The spin on those super car becomes uncontrollable, so when you are racing in HongKong or Co d'Azure, you'll have to go carefully (and slowly) to avoid spinning and crashing. And even worse, only one of the super cars is grip type. The problem is caused by the poor physics of this game, like everyone else said.  And then, BOTs. Thanks to spinning, the Koenisegg Agera R is literally undrivable. But, you'll find out those BOTs will drive this car like a gust of wind, no crashing, no spinning and don't even slide! And like GRID, BOTs of GRID2 like crashing too. That Bruno Silva guy, before the race the radio will tell you he's so agressive and always crashing others, so he hit me, well, I can't blame anyone because they warned me the guy was dangerous. But when they tell me Eliminaciόn drivers are afraid of trade paint, those guys still crashed on me. My face was like 'dafaq' as I was spinning. So since those BOTs made you so upset, why not spin them out or crash them out of track to take some revenge? No, you won't move them a little bit. If they crash you, you'll spin, and if you crash them, you'll spin too! And in two racing type the BOTs made themselves boss there. One of them is touge. In touge competitor will take penalty for hitting other driver. But in GRID2 it's directly disqualified. And here is the problem. If you crash them, you'll get disqualified, that's the rule. But if they crash you, you're still getting disqualified. Simple. The other one is drifting race. Drifting race is literally a series of jokes in GRID2. Just get behind one of your competitor and see how they drive and you'll find out that it's no even sliding, just driving fast through every corner like a normal race. And when you get to the finish you'll find out that they still have a decent score for that. Drifting itself is a joke in GRID2, drifting race is a series of jokes.  In career mode you can test drive your cars. But it's only one lap only in Indianpolis. So in real life it's reasonable because those race track will charge you for using their tracks. If you don't have much money you won't be able to go like 10 laps on the track. But come on! If you can't drive those racing car on the race track freely, why are you still playing it? Are we playing a race manager simulator rather than a race driver simulator, if it ever is?  And, well, no Nürburgring, even worse.  5/10, for the middle part of the career mode is a lot fun."
"This game has fantastic graphics even on a laptop with very average specs.   I like almost everything about it, except the handling. It's a huge drift fest. The developers decided that drifting around corners going 180 km/h is a good idea. I've played other racing games before, but simply had no luck with this one because the cornering physics is so different. I could train myself to handle the cars this way, but I don't want to change my habits for just one game.  Mind you, this IS an ARCADE STYLE racing game. I shouldn't have been expecting realism. If you like more realistic handling (i.e. actually braking before cornering), try Grid Autosport.   I bought this game with all the DLC, wish I could get all the money back but it's too late.   I really want to like this game, and I had some good times with it in the beginning, but soon I realised that it's not meant for me."
"2 months on the market and already has 7 pieces of DLC, 2 of them P2W cars. Avoid this game, and CM overall greediness, at all costs."
"Overall a good game, but there a some points that are incredibly annyoing after a while. The Handling is everything but realistic. You always start at the back, that mean you have to overtake the slow KI which is constantly blocking you on small tracks. The KI in first place wins distance in this time and its just luck when you have enough time in the last lap to overtake him. Then if you touch another Car, yours instantly loses control and you have to shift back. If another car touches you the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing happens. Feels like that their cars weight like 3tons and yours 200kg."
anybody up for drifting? lol. hahahha! super fun to drift for ppl who love car racing games but not fun coz this game is freaking hard to not bang the wall. hahahha!
"A game with a splendid visual work. As well for tracks, cities, landscapes or cars, although the choice of Japanese and American is excessive. Here, neither Porsche, Ferrari, nor Lamborghini, etc. (And Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo or other AMG against which you run in WSR, are not available in DLC) But the principal critic to do to this game, it's that instead of being called “GRID 2”, it should be called “DRIFT 2” so much ALL the cars drift, in spite of medium settings. Some are almost impossible to handle, like Ford Sierra 500, Pagani Zonda Revolucion, McLaren MP4-12C, Honda NSX-R or Koenigsegg CCGT. Even the Dallara Indy with its slick tires drifts ! What is incredible for Racing Cars which should remain like on rails ! But at the opposite, others cars are totally understeer like the three types of Nissan GTR, the Ford UTE or the brilliant Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (With these cars, take care to the size choice of your rims !) And let's not speak about the non-existent braking of almost all the cars except this little fabulous Subaru Impreza, the ridiculous engine sound of some, or the too low top speed of others. Only 223 MpH for the CCGT and 214 for the Dallara : a bad surprise, because normaly these cars exceed 250 MpH ! And for the “OnLine Races', better is to forget. It's Stock-Car between furious insane, not of the Automobile race...  Un jeu avec un travail visuel magnifique, que ce soit pour les voitures, les circuits, les villes ou les paysages, bien que le choix des Japonaises et Américaines soit excessif. Ici, ni Porsche, ni Ferrari, ni Lamborghini, etc. (Et les Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo et autres AMG contre lesquelles on court en WSR, ne sont pas disponibles en DLC) Mais le principal reproche que je ferais à ce jeu, c'est qu'au lieu de s'appeller 'Grid 2', il devrait s'appeller 'Drift 2' tellement TOUTES les voitures dérapent malgré des réglages medium. Certaines sont quasiment inconduisibles, comme la Ford Sierra 500, la Pagani Zonda Revolucion, la McLaren MP4-12C, la Honda NSX-R ou la Koenigsegg CCGT. Même la Dallara Indy avec ses pneus slicks, dérape ! Ce qui est un comble pour des Voitures de Course qui devraient rester sur des rails ! Mais à l'opposé, d'autres voitures sont totalement sous-vireuses comme les trois types de Nissan GTR, la Ford UTE ou la géniale Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (Avec ces bagnoles, faites gaffe au choix de la taille de vos jantes !) Et ne parlons pas du freinage inexistant de presque toutes les voitures excepté de cette fabuleuse petite Subaru Impreza, du ridicule son-moteur de certaines, ou de la trop basse vitesse de pointe d'autres. Seulement 360 KmH pour la CCGT et 345 pour la Dallara : une mauvaise surprise, parce que normalement ces voitures dépassent les 400 KmH ! Quant aux 'courses en Ligne', mieux vaut oublier. C'est du Stock-Car entre fous furieux, pas de la Course Automobile..."

"Amazing! The carrer mode is amazing, just outstanding. And the handling surprised me, it's better than Grid Autosport, wich is fantastic and ridiculous. The ESPN parts are just amazing... Makes he story a lot better and enjoyable! REALLY RECOMENDED!"
"crap game, dont buy it pure waste of time. Online suck ballz, every is terrible this game is about tricking us to buy the DLC.  the only ONLY good thing about it is the graphics. Tyvm pls dont support this crap."
"You think that you play Grid, but people think that they play Burnout! Instead of going faster, and turning smoother; majority of people on multiplayer prefer to hit you in the back and make you go full 360. The sad part is that there is no way to punish these players in-game! They ruin your Grid experience, and gain advantage of that! Codemasters does not do anything about it, the game does not have publisher support.   Singleplayer is fun though, but multiplayer is nothing more than rage control."

"I have a need....a need for speed...err racing. Grabbed a copy of Grid 2 Reloaded to check out some fantastic racing fun. $19.25 tax in with a bunch of DLC so I figured I couldn't go wrong.  It might not be the latest and greatest graphics, but I think it's a solid racer you can spend a few hrs messing around in it and having some fun. I am enjoying the career mode so far.  7.8/10   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKfR8e7AXoY "
"Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner."
"Looking for a good racing game, GRID2 is awsome !"
"Can't play this game because it's crushes at start up. I updated all drivers and other software including driver for my MOMO® Racing Force Feedback Wheel, checked all HDD's, checked system with antivirus... but this !@#$^^% game still not working. I want my money back!"
"One of the most disappointing racing games for me. The first GRID was incredible and had a more semi-sim feeling to it where as GRID 2 is 100% arcade, something that is very unlike what Codemasters have been doing since the first Race Driver. The sponsors function has been changed completely, very dumbed down. And the absence of a decent monetary system is very disappointing. There's nothing left of what made the first GRID great. Thanks Codemasters for ruining a great game."

"I give this game a 9/10.  + Great graphics + Amazing damage models, from scratches to blown wheels going off + Outstunning details, you can actually see the engine and the suspension working if you get some parts off your car + Total of 76 vehicles + Career mode with more than 30 hours of playtime  - Online mode is region locked, and it's a whole new game"
"Crappy GRID 2 ,first GRID 100% BETTER"
Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I can't even believe the ♥♥♥♥ that Codemasters is trying to pull by having made this game. This is literally a downgrade from Grid 1. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing stunned that this is even a game.   Pros: looks nice  Cons: .Driving physics are stripped down and completely different resulting in a straight downgrade from the first game  .the handling is too sensitive. you drift simply by turning hard enough and the game has nothing but hairpin turns  .You HAVE to use the brake instead of the E-brake to drift .drifting is god awful .Simplified hud .default controller layout is changed for no reason and is worse.  .Blatant advertising .dated references  .Seriously the first achievement you get is a reference to a 3-year old pop song. It's only going to get more dated as time goes on.  .linear story mode  .Some ♥♥♥♥ is constantly yammering in my ear and attempting to stroke my ego while simultaneously screaming about some stupid competition that I care nothing about and then proceeds to explain it to me like I've never played a racing game or watched a racing movie.  .announcer/coach that holds your hand and patronizes you every step of the way no matter how bad you mess up .Forced account signup for some stupid network you're never gonna use .no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit view .NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RACE DAY MODE  This is probably the worst part about the game. I could handle all of the above. Even the inferior handling but when you can't even stop the campaign to enjoy some laps by yourself and trying out new cars then it's not even worth playing. I don't know of any racing game and I sure as hell don't know any racing sims that doens't have a test track mode.    -3/10.  I paid next to nothing for this game and I still regret it.
"I'm a pretty huge fan of racing games in general, and to be honest, I've played most of them too, whether it be forza, dirt, gran turismo, test drive, need for speed... you get the point. This game is truely up there with the rest. Codemasters have made yet another awesome title, however I can't stop thinking its Dirt on asphalt, the driving mechanics are very similar to Dirt, however they are very different to that of other racing games. To be honest, i'm not complaining tho, the driving is much smoother than most racing games and can become quite enjoyable after a while.  GRID 2 provides an awesome variety of maps and enviroments from places in USA, Europe and Asia. Not to mention the cars, there is more than enough to choose from for each season and the difficulties are neither too hard, too easy... but just right, compared to that of Dirt 3 (way too easy).  Although it may not have the open world gameplay of test drive unlimited, or the graphics in forza and it is hardly an improvement multiplayer, but with aggressive AI and enjoyable handling, Codemasters ensure that this game is always challeging, and there is more than enough hours of fun packed within this game."
"As an arcade racer sure, it is decent and can be fun. However I was hoping for something closer to NFS Shift 2, a game that has the heart of a Sim racer with a bit more accessibility. The driving feels very drifty and exaggerated and is easier to manage with a gamepad controller then it is with a racing wheel. The biggest gripe I have is the omission on the cockpit view, it makes me just not want to play the game at all. My second biggest Gripe is the way DLC is handled. The game feels more like a F2P pay2win game where all the best parts are behind a pay wall. The base game comes with enough to get by but why do I need to pay more to race with my favorite car or on my favorite track. It is just a shame."
"This is a down grade from Grid 1, all the dlc from the start was a big scam where they just cut off content. Everything that made grid great is gone in this game. This is just some cop off of need for speed shift.. which was also terrible. The driving physics in this game are unbearable, knowing this is the sequel to one of the best driving games ever to come out on pc only makes it that much worse. do not buy."
"While the graphics have improved, the racing excitement and game-play from Grid is gone; no teams or team mate, no licenses, no money (win fans instead!!!), no open seaters, no LeMans and few actual circuits. The game is linear and you have no choice where to race. The roads are lined with walls and hitting them seem to be integrated into the game. The in-session commentary is annoying and condescending and no option to change it."
"worst simulator ever, nothing realistic, very bad multiplayer!!"
"Same tracks, different cars. Now the option to purchase additional maps and custom cars for additional costs. My thoughts; If you have Grid, ...no need for Grid2."
"Grid 2 is a game which tries too many different things and does most of them poorly. The biggest disappointment here for most Codies fans will be the driving physics, which are laughable. When you realise drifing round a corner is faster than braking and clipping the apex, the game immediately loses any shine.  It looks good enough, but the huge amount of street courses versus the comparatively few road courses and the shonky driving model make for a pretty bland experience. Little bugs here and there once again dent the presentation, which - like DiRT - gets caught up in big name sponsors instead of focusing on the driving itself.  A lack of a cockpit view is the final nail in the coffin for Grid 2. Very disappointing experience."
marginally above average arcade racer let down by the fact that it's hard to find anyone to race online  after spending a bit more time in the game I feel that I should also point out that almost everyone who plays this game online is an absolute a$$ h0le ... most people have no desire to actually race and all they want to do is ruin it for other players by smashing you off the track
"If you've ever driven a car before, don't buy this. Seriously, in what world is a 69 Dodge Charger a drift car? Every car is basically fueled by doritos and REQUIRES you to drift. You literally cannot drive like you should be able to, and that is without smoke and sliding. And I swear to all that is holy if Codemasters puts one more ♥♥♥♥ing brotastic announcer in their games I'm going to lose it.   'IN ORDER TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF THIS CAR YOURE GONNA HAVE TO DRIFT, WHOA MAN PUT THAT ON YOUTUBE, WE HAVE SO MANY FANS'  SHUT UP   I know I don't have much play time in this game at all but it only took 10 minutes to figure out this game's a joke."
"If you are expecting GRID in this game forget it... if you are expecting need for speed, you might like it. Graphics are poor compared to first, game is fully arcade, there isn't a SINGLE realistic option coming from the first (there's actually no reallistic options, game is full arcade) if you destroy parts of your car during the race it makes almost no difference for your turning and accelerating capacities. In general, this game sux. Biggest disappointment from 2013. THAT IS NOT Grid."
"Best looking racer made so far, but unfortunately has no cockpit mode. Gameplay is solid but at higher speeds the tracks can feel too narrow. Driving model seems to split the difference between modern Need for Speeds and Forzas in terms of realism."
"So i finished the game.. BUT generaly it was BAD...  Firstly and most annoying the opponent AI cars are like immortal. I mean come on! you crash on them with 270km, you get tossed like &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 and they are just keep going like nothing happened AND NO DAMAGES? really?  The maps .. All the same, no matter what mode you play. 5-6 areas with a biiiiiiiit modified tracks. The 'freezing' because of enviromental lightning.. Doesn't matter how high or low you have your graphics. Doesn't matter if it's Intel or AMD. IT WILL FREEZE for a few miliseconds that will propably ruin your race especialy online. The car handling. The whole thing was bad. where are those awesome ORIGINAL GRID settings for realistic driving? They don't even have the HEAD VIEW option.  Now for the online mode. This was the worst. The menus.. You have to click in damn LOT choices to just enter an event.. You need to exit a party to change car settings or get new unlocks or upgrade cars -means you will lose that party, take it's sweet time to find new-. The car menu was poorly designed.. To upgrade cars you kept needed to move up and down on riddiculus selections, to swich between cars you need to do all over menu browse from start.. ReALLY? Second most stupid thing online.. CHEATERS .. yep just like dirt or f1 we have a lots of those here .. nothing more to say. And ofcourse that there is no penalty for those who are just playing to crash on you so their 'pals' can get the flag. THIS IS NO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3ING DIRT!  My opinion, get GRID 1 if you want a really good racing game.. with a LOT of tracks and cars again, with NO need for stupid upgrates.. Just get money and buy cars.. Just no online games there. lan and splitscreen are still available."
Its a good game... BUT the people who play it will allways chash you. I have played for about 10+ hours and every single lobby is full of people who wants to make the race annoying and fustrating:(
"I wannabe a Rockstar I wannabe a Drifter I wannabe a Simulator I wannabe a Arcader  This racer wants to be everything but is only bad at everything. Terrible race tracks. Boring cars and terrible DLC model. 'Real' damage but terrible physics. Every car feels like you're dragging ten tons of sand behind it. No fun race modes. This really is an almost there but terribly short of it racer. And of course, everything has a nice high contrast extra brown look. UGLY!  Avoid this clunker."
Good graphics and good gameplay. But if you want to play online then it might not be such a good idea. No one else plays this game online.
The game is not a very good racing game.
"I'll be honest; i've never been a great racing sport fan in real life and same with the games. But THIS one was special. It has a really great mix between realistic car racing sport and the special 'fancy' over-the-top drifting and overtaking moments! Really enjoyed the campaign and the many options to play this game! (SP, MP, Splitscreen, Custom Races) Would recommend EVERYone to try this game to see if they're into racing games. Also awesome with friends in multiplayer which is still played! (Crash Derby for trolling hard! :D) 9/10"
"This Game Is F*****g Bullocks!!!!!  Ok, so what I have managed to play seems cool enough and actually not that bad but, the problem this game has is functionality, I am a victim of the dreaded black screen!! I have tried every fix out there and although for some they worked well enough I was still never quite able to get it play more than once. just out of curiosity today i decided to load the game and see if anything has been fixed? THE GAME WORKS!!!! But if at first something seems to good to be true it probably is, I was able to play 1 almost 2 complete races and then black screen 'grid 2 executable has stopped working' Well F**K it, if you want to throw your money away as I have then, I cant stop you!!!"
"I cannot control Drift, it does auto drift and cannot countersteer properly, it does it automatically and i try to control the car in the corner it slams hard and steering goes everywhere, this game is for people who may not care about this auto thing, or who never played decent car game before. i think this game would be ok for girls to play in ipad swipe left and right  Grid 1 was better."
Singeleplayer: Ok.  Not as good as the one from the first Grid. Repetitive tracks. Fun at stages.  Multiplayer: Just bad! Pointless level system.  Annoying lobby system. The rules of most the modes are just unbalanced and stupid. Voice over ip makes up the rest.   Conclusion:  Just don't buy it until you just want to play a singleplayer.  For fans of the first one: just act like this is not a sequel to it. :D
"Doesn't work, mysterious graphics glitches and no support from the developer."
"Truth be told, it isn't the best when it comes to the amount of content featured: 50 ish cars and less than 20 tracks, not including the layouts, as well as stupidly overpriced DLC just for (mostly) modified versions of existing cars.  It also handles almost nothing like the original Race Driver: GRID. Any car can drift, even Grippy-type ones, with some handbrake persuasion. About the only thing that's improved instead of replaced is the damage modelling. Frankly, Codemasters should've renamed the game if the only thing keeping it in touch with the original GRID is the premise of tackling multiple motorsport disciplines, from straight up races to touges.  Visually, there's no denying it; GRID 2 looks beautiful, and for once I accept the large amounts of lens flare and lens grime, only because there is no true Dashboard Camera. This game really doesn't need it anyway.  Sound design is also amazingly well done. It's quite rare to see a racing game do the Skyline R34 engine and exhaust sounds as close to the real thing as it gets, and then there's the tunnels and terrain echoing.  Career mode offers varied racing disciplines, and the multiplayer is very solid, but it all depends on your ability to look past the changed features, little content and LACK OF COCKPIT VIEW *grrrr* for an otherwise pure racing experience."
Arcade racing game that is not fun to me. Controls/physics blow donkey (richard)
"no, just no.  saved games disspear/corrupt.  can't set or detect steering wheel properly (including overwriting directinput.xml file) dead spot almost 100 degrees.  extermely slow just to start a single race (i don't want to go into career mode as they keep getting deleted)  slow to do anything.  oh forgot game connects in multiplayer and then disconnects at start line.   i tried to give it a go but honestly I should have returned it after an hour."
"Great game. So easy to just jump into and have a few races, nice control in the car. Custom settings to get your own preferance. If you enjoy racing games, this is for you.  Fully reccommend!"
"Isn't the best, but we don't have many choices in 2013.  Grid2 - is good MODERN racing game, 1st Codemaster's try to make something like racing massive multiplayer game.  So if u have PC &amp; wheel, and tied to race along - i would recommend to buy grid2, it's fun.  But don't expect any serious simracing expirience here, wait for Project Cars and Asseto Corsa =)  "

Game is well optimized but the only thing that is missing is a ♥♥♥♥ pit view. If this game is on sale I would reccomend it.
"For someone like me, (who loves Codemasters' games as well as the orginal GRID) the standard version of GRID 2 is dissapointing and deviates from what made the original game so good.   I really want to praise the fantastic visuals, incredible sound design, with impressive roster of cars and a decent online multiplayer, but there are some glaring problems. I could go on about the horrible americanised story, which is tedious and dull. I could do a rant on the 'Truefeel' handling system that robs the car's identity when driving and I could rage about the omission of the cockpit view, but these aren't the true reasons why, I just can't in good faith, give this game the recommended verdict.   The actual reasoning is it's DLC, which is FAR too overpriced. At £25 for all the DLC you get the following: - 5 Tracks (15 routes).  - 24 Cars (2 liveries). - A 15% discount on every in-game purchase in online multiplayer. - Instant access to every online car. (This doesn't include the free demoliton derby game mode) That may seem much, but as the game is £20, it's far less value, while creating a massive player disconnect in the multiplayer.  Overall if you like GRID stay the hell away from this, and wait for GRID Autosport. This is too much of a cash grab that tarnishes the GRID name.   5/10   "
"This isn't a sim, but neither was the first Grid game. What this is, is tons of fun. And not to mention, the graphics are absolutely stunning. I really like the courses as well. On city streets, and windy, country roads. There is just the right amount of grip and slip that just feels good with a Xbox controller.   I say if you want realism. Go race a real car because no sim is going to give you G forces.   I'm deffenetly going to spring some extra for the DLC."
"Wasn't sure what to think about this racing game. But when I started it, I was suprised by the nice graphics of the game. It looks absolutely amazing! Was always searching a racing game for the computer (before I played Gran Turismo on PS3) and finally found my replacement.  Important to know, it's not a simulator with realistic physics, but an awesome arcade racer :-)"
"Writing this review, I'm 7 hours into the game. So, what can I say about it ? Is it possible to review GRID2 without mentionning GRID ?  I don't think so. So, let's kick it off with the new things. The things they added. - The LiveTrack. 100% unrealistic, painful if you like to know the tracks you are racing on, the LiveTrack is used for classic races or Endurance... Speaking of which: - Endurance mode. Basically, it's a fancy name to try and make you believe it's also brand new, when it's really just a race that ends at a specific time rather than a specific line. - Story. Let's face it, the first GRID was minimalist, story speaking. But it also didn't need it, and the lack of it - or the small presence of it - didn't bother me. This time, however, there is a scenario. This time, you are building the WSR, the World Series Racing. Some cinematics, some (fake) coverage by ESPN... It definitely feels more alive.  Now, for the things they modified or deleted. - Cameras. No more interior camera - which is a shame, we'll admit it - and, more importantly, totally trashed up TV cameras - taking away all the value of the replays. No really, replaying your best drifts on GRID was like watching 2 Fast 2 Furious, in GRID2 it feels like the cameraman browses /r/trees on a daily basis. - Teammate. It was fun, knowing your fellow crew member was out there, helping you out on the track, pushing opponents out of the track, stealing the first place and apologizing deeply when he finished last. Now, all you have is the guy talking to you since day 1 (but you still don't know who it is) and complaining he'll have to mend your car when you wreck it. - The Drifting. It's hard to explain. But the drifting in GRID felt a hundred times better. Firstly, you were  alone  on the track, without stupid people pushing you out of the way because they forgot which race category they were in. Secondly, the vibe was astonishing - the japanse speakerman going crazy over your moves, the crowd... And lastly, it just felt more responsive. The combo system was nice and clear, the way the car drifted was purely arcade but so enjoyable... - No more rep/money system. GRID2 brings in the 'fan system', already seen in Blur, for example.  - Aaaaaand the way the sponsors work changed too. And this time, it clearly is below what GRID offered.  That's not all, these are just the things that pop out first when I think about it. Now, the graphics are really nice, there are plenty of cars to choose from, and the tracks are still interesting. So ?  1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale  3) Recommended  4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play  It's probably still better to grab it while it's on sale - hint: it's really cheap - but if you like arcade racing, and/or the first GRID, well, go for it."
"Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.  Best Game Moment: Aggressively drifting round a final corner to take first place and win a championship."
Looks good and feels realistic.
"Apparently GRID stands for: Greatly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Infitive Drifting.... Campaign: Stereotypical, you'll find yourself bored after 2 hours/10 races Graphich and Audio: Great Controls: Np on keyboard Handling: Nonexisting, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of cars, cosmetic tweaks and stuff.  Not worth 25+ bucks For 5 dolla' great enough for drifting enthusiasts."
"Excellent arcade and terrible sequel. It's even not a sequel, it's completely another game, named GRID2 by mistake. If you are looking for some racing action - GRID2 is good choice. If you're looking for real GRID sequel... Well, I have bad news for you. It is still not released yet."
"very good graphics and driving mechanics, and it's very fun to put sponsors on your cars! very nice career mode that you can set the liveries for each of your car. it's enough to be a recommended racing game. but i miss my teammate from the first Grid game, it must be more fun if you can recruit one driver to be your teammate like in the previous Grid."
"A well-curated car list, a great sense of speed, and a well-thought out career mode combine in a racer that is a lot of fun to play through."
"Short version: Not anywhere as good as Grid 1, but still a fun $5 for a racing game. Multiplayer is pretty inactive &amp; the DLC is mostly stupid.  Long version:  I was a huge Grid 1 fan, and at first play this game disappointed me at how different it is. Grid 1 wants you to turn corners carefully, 2 wants you to drift drift drift all the time. It's very arcadey &amp; far from the sim based racer 1 is. Multiplayer servers aren't very active, I think people have moved on to Autosport &amp; other games. I really hate the corner cutting 'feature', its punishment enough when you accidentally go over gravel or grass, I don't need an additional penalty for a mistake.  The maps get pretty old, even though they have you race on different sections of the same area. The later parts of the game get really hard because the tier4 cars are nigh uncontrollable. I had better times in the slower tier2 cars than I did the 200 mph+ tier4 cars because I crash at every turn in the tier3/4 cars.  One thing this game did well was a variety of gametypes. As opposed to just race, drift &amp; head to head from 1, it added checkpoint, overtake, time attack &amp; togue.  As a comparison to Grid 1, it's very inferior. As a cheap racing game, it's fun enough.  Overall verdict: 7.2/10"
"Like all racing titles from Codemasters, this one is another piece of crap. If you want a good racing sim, pick one from EA or Atari.   You start with an undriveable car, that won`t make a curve if your life depended on it. That makes the game very frustrating.   In terms on UI, this game is also a fail. Is most parts of the game, the only option to exit the game is to use ALT+F4. The ESC key won't always work and there is no way to skip the painfully long and slow cinematics.   From a scale of 0-10, this game gets a very round ZERO."
♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ there is no simulation in this game. This game is junk ♥♥♥♥.... Evereybody crashing each others ahhh... this game deep ♥♥♥♥.
Dem physics  And where is cockpit camera?
"Grid (the first one) was the best - this one sucks.. has no real point, even the racing is just... meh.  Graphics are ok, tracks are ..meh..   if you get it free- then sure by all means, but dont waste the money on it.  "
 Game was played on Hard
"Wow at the time I got this game I thought it was awsome, its finally for the right price as a racing fan I was let down that I cannot use my wheel to drive this game due to the reason of the view, it was a very big deal to many people to feel like you're in a car but that didn't come with grid 2 which was a letdown, some might say the originals was much better but this is fun too, The Dlc cars are super POWERFUL and you'll pretty much own everyone, Drifting was extremly hard in this game and well it felt good at time but at the same time it felt unatural.  This game has + Graphics are great + The sound is fantastic very realistic. + Adrenaline pumping racing + Theres alot of different gameplay modes you can do + Multiplayer is smooth runs smooth +20 dollars or below is a reasonable price.   - Not many customization on your vehicle and lack of it - Lots of people hated it because of the view, missing COCKPIT view was taken out of the game, very big deal for racers who wants immersion - DLC cars are overpowered - Drifting feels unsatisfying  - game feels more arcadey this time around"
I keep crashing into walls.       Paul Walker/10
"If you like racing games, you would probably like this cause it's a racing game."
"Not the most realistic racing game, but I liked it alot. Graphics, effects and gameplay are awesome."
This game is crap. biggest waste of money i have every used to purchace a game. It is not grid it is just dirt but not a good dirt. want my money back. this game is ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥.
So grid 2 is very good but there are things that you simply times bad so is the first computer drives like the last bum that you'll last and broken car has and the time race is the last garbage without joking that money was have again is not so because of her my rating 4/10
I advise NO ONE to buy this game until they fix errors with Demolition Derby. I bought it for the add-on derby mod and it doesn't count all your laps some times and they have done NOTHING to fix the error. Because they don't want to fix the errors they know exists wouldn't buy this game.
I wish someone would do more with the demoliton dlc. I love bashing into the other cars. I just wish someone would expand on this. I can only find one car and one track for bashing into other rolling death machines.   Great racing game though. One of the best I have.
i am very sad after i buy this game there is very hard to control the car and drift Not like NFS
"There is a special place in hell for the UI developers of Codemasters. How tragic that a fairly decent racing sim gets completely ruined by their menu, thier cut-scenes and their utter disregard for the player. Whenever I encounter this game all I want to do is smash my controller against the wall. "
It can not be installed. Support does not help. I do not recommend this game.  Не устанавливается. Служба поддержки не помогает. Не рекомендую. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
"Yeah, this game is fun, I guess. Some of the mechanics are ridiculous, though. If an NPC spins you out or even nudges your bumper mid-race, you are guaranteed to end up facing the opposite way you need to be, though, regardless of how well you try to steer out of it, and might as well just restart as there is no possible way to recover. So just be forewarned - save yourself a lot of frustration and know that unless you race perfectly, be prepared to 'restart' a lot of races. Some races are factually unwinnable, especially the ones at the racetracks. The best, though, are the races where you're all in the exact same car, but the NPCs can corner at 120mph and you spin out at 60. The game is fun, to be sure, once you know what you're doing, but just be prepared for a lot of WTF head shaking at the blatant cheating. I am going to say that I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for two dollars or less."
"I have recently bought GRID autosport, which probably means that i am not going to be playing GRID 2 very regularly as i have migrated to playing autosport, so i decided that i would write a review, seeing as i was rather close to 100 hours so i think i know what im talking about, or atleast mostly.  GRID 2 is an amazing game, probably the best racing game that i am yet to play, other than the new release of GRID which is infact GRID autosport. There are so many features and aspects that i like about GRID 2, but im not going to list them all as i would be going on forever, so im going to keep them blunt, short but informative at the same time.  Things i liked about the game: --------------------------------  The controls: The controls took me a matter of minutes to get use to, and from there i was able to drive nice and smoothly, without having to worry about pressing the wrong button on my remote. (I believe you can also use a steering wheel for this game).  The detail/graphics: The maps, the cars, the road, even the cones. you name it. Everything looks brilliant. The reflections on the cars are brilliant, and this detail is consistent throughout the whole game, and the graphics that they have produced, can even run on my computer which i am suprised about. The game is not slow or laggy whatsoever, meaning that you can have a very smooth racing experience, but at the same time have a lovely eyesite of distant mountains, as you control your car.  Music: The game has a variety of different tracks that are played throughout the game. The loading music, the main menu music, the racing music, all of it is of a high standard, and is great to listen to, and really makes you feel like your driving a car.  AI: The AI of this game are great. The WSR campaign, which is pretty much a singleplayer mode, is absolutely realistic, due to the fact that the computer drivers have been programmed so good. When driving, the way that the drivers move and think are so lifelike, and occasionally challenge you if you do in-fact smash into the back of there car, but i wouldn't try it.  Handling: All of the cars are tuned to perfection, and getting use to each type of handling, which each of the cars uniquely have is done with ease.   Multiplayer: Although the multiplayer is on the verge of becoming dead, its still great fun when playing with a full lobby, and the feeling of taking another persons car out after them doing it before hand is beautiful. (Not that thats how you should drive.)  Bad points about the game: -----------------------------  What are you talking about? There are no bad points about this game! Despite all the people that have played GRID 2 and complained about it, i think that they should simply realise that codemasters took their time making this, as it is truly a masterpiece, and an experience that i am never going to forget. The game is absolutely brillaint, and upon buying GRID autosport which was released shortly after im reviewing this, i cannot wait to carry on with the next game in the series. Thank you so much codemasters for bringing us this game, and i would like to thank you for also releasing Autosport, as so far it is brilliant. Thank you, and i hope that this review has influenced anyone that is planning on buying the game."
Runs perfect and looks great.
"Game is bad if compared to Dirt series. Pretty boring game actually. Yeah just buy dirt 1,2, or 3 BUT there is one thing what i like in this game: -Two player splitscreen"
"i like how they have built drifting into the physics so that you can choose to use it or not (although id say the game favours the drifting style). very cool.  i never used the ♥♥♥♥ pit view but ill admit it was a nice novelty, meh w/e its still every bit as good as the first imo."
"I don't always play racing game, but when I do it's Grid 2"
ron pls come back we love you
"I played this game yesterday, really like it. Looks like i'm too late to buy it for 6,24€ too bad."
"Online player base is decreasing, we gotta keep the game alive!"
"This game is epic i have enjoyed every Heart stopping moment,wether it was paly'n single player or online the gameplay imo is solid, fun, and exciting!.So do yourself a favour and get a copy!."

"Best graphics of all the Codies racing games. Tight, intense, wheel to wheel racing against both the AI and online competitors.  Ignore the fuss about no cockpit view, modders added that in before it even came out in EU.  If you enjoy racing games, whether simulation or arcade, GRiD 2 strikes a solid balance between the two."
"Yeah, this game is fun, I guess. Some of the mechanics are ridiculous, though.

"GRID 2 is a great racing game. Great graphics, great damage model. The online community is good, with multiple online modes to choose from."
"50% of the time you play this game, you will be stuck in un-skippable cutscenes.. 25% will be you rewinding you mistakes. 10% you will be penalized for 'cutting corners'. 10% you will be disqualified because someone else hit your car. 5% you will have a fun time racing."
"One of the most amazing racing game i have played till now. -Great graphics a stunning details. -Most realistics drifts. -Every detailing of cars n atmosphere is done perfectly. -Great choice of cars. -The aim Increasing Ours Fans By the sponser objective is new for me and i liked it . -Different kind'a races such as drift, overtake, time attack ,etc are also nice n i liked the overtake one as its different from nfs series as they have limited races such street race, drag race , time attack ,etc. -If you have Played NFS Series and liked it You will surely like this game as its somewat different kind of racing game then nfs street racing. -Great Car Handeling . -Releastic sound of cars are also awsome.   I will give this game overall 9/10 points. If You are a racing game fan you should buy this game."

"Looks good. Everything else is S.H.I.T.E.  When you think NFS Underground 2 or Carbod had bad physics, think again. This one is BAD. Game should be called DRIFT, not GRID. i mean even effing 4by4 subaru or lancer is spinning and drifting on every corner, and god forbid you to touch the wall, u will be making 360 turn x10 times in no time.  Flip the car over the roof x50 times - no problem, just touch that curb at slow speed.  But man, graphics are good. Grid Online menu is crap. All those tiers and how to join particular game level? Dunno. VERY CONFUSING MENUS. Online challenges are fun.  Weekly rivals WTF??!!!!!  Finding online game is like finding Nemo (proably less sun tho).  What else? oh, music - fine , good soundtrack. Make sure you turn off Voice volume, really those comments are annoying (but that goes to every Codemasters game, like DIRT, etc.)  6/10 overall, and really just bought it because sales.  played Grid 1 ages ago, but cant rememer it being so bad. Was it?  anyway, this one is probably worth 12 bucks with all DLC.  or was it too much Forza for me over last few years :)))))  Gonna try Grid Autosport, see what its like.  "
"To the senses, this game is amazing. Beautiful graphics and with accurate and detailed sounds easily draw you in. After that, however, things can become a bit muddy. Is it a sim? Is it an arcade racer? It's difficult to tell exactly what this game was intended to be. And while it may seem a bit pedantic to complain, there's a point to be made. When going through the first few minutes of any game, it is essential to get a good feel for how things handle. Physics and controls are VERY important, and once you get a handle on what to expect, the better you become. That goes doubly so for racers. In a simulation game, physics and car characteristics vary from vehicle to vehicle, but all within reason; opponents follow the rules of their car. Conversely, arcade racers are allowed some wiggle room with drift or grip handling and wacky doodle physics to make the ride fun; opponents follow their own rules of performance. This game just kind of screws you around with everything. Car handling is weird and unpredictable, and the moment you get a hang of how goofy your car is, they make you switch to something else that is equally ridiculous and goofy. The 'marked' opponents that you're supposed to 'watch out for' have god-like attributes to their vehicles in most cases, as they always shoot to the front and away from the pack. So while you're busy flopping around trying to deal with your car on a new track you cannot practice on (another huge gripe), the marked opponent, in the very same car you have, is inexplicably way ahead of you.  I don't exactly hate it, I'm still trying to get the hang of it, but everything is just so imbalanced that when I try to treat it like one type of racer, I'm immediately punished for it. Where's the fun in that?"

Great game! ★★★★★
"Good and varied roster of cars. actually impressed to see cars like the BAC Mono in here. cars are pretty and detailed. graphics are very nice, but trees look very bad during the night/with fog. physics aren't that bad. however, cars drift too much (even if they are 'grip') and the crash engine is very unforgiving, especially when crashing against AI (they don't seem to be affected if you crash against them. however, you will start making spins which is really, really frustrating). multiplayer is dead, which is a shame. not one of the best racing games i have played, but still pretty fun (if you can stand the problems it has)"
It's all fun and games till THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING JAPANESE RACES COME UP WITH THOSE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING UNBEATABLE CAR CHALLENGES OH MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD THIS GAME MADE ME ♥♥♥♥ING ANGRY
"This game is very limited compared to the original GRID in terms of what you can do, only specific tracks can be used for certain disciplines and the original 'freeroam' drifting is gone. No more sliding sideways endlessly for a 99x combo which is what I played the original game for, a little dissapointed to be honest/ Stick to the original GRID for more fun."
"GRID 2 is a great racing game. Great graphics, great damage model. The online community is good, with multiple online modes to choose from."
Well what could I say. A.I. cars hit you like ping pong ball in this one. Physics and handling sucks. Try it before you buy it.
Brilliant game. Makes other raceing games look boring. Would recommend.
Brilliant game. Makes other raceing games look boring. Would recommend.
Nice racing game. Had lot of fun playing multiplayer games.
"Really let down by this game. Everything that I loved from the first game no longer exists in the sequal. No team racing, no cockpit view, and even the garages are less interesting.   Though the landscapes are gorgeous, some of the car damage should have been more detailed. The AI is hit or miss from race to race with some of the races being super easy while others will have you restarting the race until uttter frustration sets in.  Also the 'fan' counter gets old real fast esp when you cant skip it.  All in all 5/10."
"GRID 2 is an arcade racing game made for players using a gamepad or their keyboard. If you want a realistic racing game, you should not buy GRID 2. I was very disappointed... I preordered it for 35,99€ and I have to say it was a waste of money. Because of that preordering I received a free copy of GRID 1, which was a big reason for me buying the game, because I really liked the car physics and graphics of GRID 1 at that time. Do not get me wrong, I still think GRID 1 is an excellent racing game! Actually it is the best I have ever played. I just can't understand what codemasters tried to do with GRID 2, I just don't get it...  I played the first part of GRID and GRID 2 is a totally different game. GRID 1 had a cockpit view, which does NOT exist in GRID 2! For me personally the cockpit view is one of the most important things to make a racing game realistic. The developers said they invested much time in making the cars behave realistic on the asphalt. They failed miserably... Every car feels the same. There is no real difference. Drifting is totally unrealistic. If you want to drift you just have to fastly turn the wheel to one side, then turn it back to the other side and you are drifting. Normally when you're drifting in a realistic racing game or in reality itself you should lose time, but not in GRID 2. It feels like you always have to drift to maintain your speed. So many good game modes (drift-challenge, touge, profi-touge etc.) from GRID 1 are just left out completely in GRID 2. They tried to put a story into the game, which is actually a good idea. You have to show your skills in different racing leagues all over the world to get their appreciation and win them for the WRC (World Series Racing), a league where the best drivers of the world meet each other on the racetrack. The idea is great, but the implementation didn't succeed... It's always the same: Win in leagues, unlock new leagues, win against those leagues, win the WRC, win in new leagues, unlock, WRC...  If you want to play a realistic racing game with great game modes and a cockpit view, buy GRID 1 instead of GRID 2. If you already played GRID 1 and think about buying GRID 2, because you liked the gameplay, do NOT do that. You will only be very disappointed. It has nothing to do with the previous version of GRID."
"This is an amazing racing game, and for people who say it controlls like ice try taping the a or d button in stead of holding it, you will have better control, and dont hold gas when you are drifting through corners"
"I do not regret money that i gave for this game, tbh so sick game :)"
Pretty fun game with tons of cars. I actually like the fact that you don't have to customize your parts / performance just choose whatever car you want and go for it. I like that it has a split screen mode but I would have liked it if you could do career with split screen too. I really like the re-do feature so I don't have to start the whole race over again when I mess up :)
"this game isnt really fun if you dont have a controller but holy ♥♥♥♥, demolition derby makes it all worth it."
"I remember playing the Demo for the original Grid to death. I was blown away by the destruction engine and I could not get enough of the slow-mo cinematic totaling of my car. Well I never picked up the full release of the game, but I'm glad I got Grid 2. It's everything I expected from a modern racing sim. The cars handle well, the destruction and performance degradation feels visceral and justified and my god the game is gorgeous.   It's not for everyone, but for other racing fans out there, you'd be missing out if you never played Grid 2."
"Very fun game, especially online full damage 0 flashbacks."
"DONT BUY THIS.The driving physics is horrible.Non-friendly handling different from GRID Codemaster totally success to ruin GRID series. BTW,Codemaster's game, i only prefer GRID.Da others like DIRT series and F1 Series both sucks too bad thing is i cant get a refund now fk"
I've got a logitech F710. I thought I would have throttle/break control. Nope it's either 100 acceleration or nothing. This one thing makes the experience way to cheap.
"Casually playing the game in multiplayer. Suddenly the game crashes for no reason. Tries again, at the end of last race game crashes again. 'Steam servers cannot deal with your request' or something along those lines. Uninstalled- wont be touching it ever again. Also an annoying console port, no mouse controls whatsoever. Everything is controlled using the keyboard/controller this includes both menus and ingame. Lots of loading screens and useless waiting times."
"Grid 2 likes to use the tagline 'The Thrill of Driving' to describe the game in a single marketing slogan. I think that's a pretty apt phrase because this is a driving game that really, fully, single-mindedly commits to the 'thrill' of driving as compared to other driving games both from Codemasters and other development houses out there which throw their focus more on the lavish depth of accuracy in the presentation of the cars, or the devoted attention to the sport of motor racing with a high emphasis on realism in performance. No, Grid 2 is a game so devoted to that 'Thrill of Driving' aspect that I think it's carved out a whole niche to itself: Driving Pornography.  In Grid 2 you are encouraged to drive full tilt without consideration for gas, tire wear, or weather conditions. You need not concern yourself about the damage you incur by driving clumsy, and there are no penalties for being unsportsmanlike. All Grid 2 wants from you is to drive fast, fast, fast, and to feel awesome and look cool while you're doing it.   Here's some thoughts about what makes this game unique in presentation: you will be given cars that have minimal explanation of the differences between them and yet enjoyable handling subtleties are there which render some choices powerful while others are over-the-top suicidal until you've had 60+ hours of practice with them. The single player campaign throws the beginner driver (without practice first) into the midst of tracks that can and will destroy your vehicle if you lose traction, then makes sure that the sun is shining in your face as you round hairpin turns. You will be given control of cars that can do 220 mph in straight runs and then be asked to make near constant right angle turns through the narrow streets of Chicago. Cost is literally no object here as your garage grows regularly in size because of the ephemeral power of 'fans' which is a weak and poorly executed stand-in for 'money' in the single player game. You will drive your multi-million dollar supercars as though they were replaceable toys and slam them, drift them, and wear them out with gleeful abandon and then see them magically repaired at no cost or penalty for the next race. For better or worse you'll never spend too much time on any given race as they typically last between two and six minutes in length and even the custom and online races limit you to no more than 10 laps at a time. Grid 2 is also *EXTREMELY* drift-happy and loves nothing better than to see 12 cars sliding their way through an apex and bumping and slapping each other and the walls all the way.  Driving pornography: Grid 2 is definitely not to be confused with a full depth driving simulation experience, -it is absolutely an arcade game and as such it is very, very approachable and very, very fun.  As a followup to Grid 1, the sequel is pretty much more of the same with an even greater emphasis on the 'pretty'. While the cars aren't as lushly rendered as Forza the presentation is slick and polished and there's a nice sense of differentiation between both the different tier levels of cars on offer and the various types within each tier. The tracks come in many varieties from narrow street point-to-point journeys to real-world circuit tracks that offer more true sport-like experiences. Unlike some other Codemasters racing games you won't be constantly bugged and mugged by the different personalities of the competition drivers although you'll still be able to pick out which of the AI drivers has been tweaked to always be at the head of the pack no matter what. Unlike Grid 1 this sequel feels compelled to offer some sort of story explanation for why you're racing in so many different styles of cars and racing disciplines and I found the presentation to be ridiculous and unnecessary, particularly when my beginner racing performance (consisting of bulldozing my way through the lead cars in order to get ahead) was hailed as 'champion' material by the ESPN hosts complete with inane online message forum 'fans' frothing at the bit because of my awesomeness.  Multiplayer has the potential to be really entertaining but at this point in the game's release it's pretty hit-and-miss. For starters I found the my default U.S. server literally empty for days at a time until I read on a forum that you should change your regional setting to Europe (I chose London) where there's more people frequently playing (still sparse though with less than 7 race sessions at any given time). Once I succesfully joined a match it was good to see that the tiered performance structure means that it's difficult for veteran players to have cars which are inherently better than what a newcomer would be able to compete against. The bad news is that it doesn't matter because veterans will have memorized all the track layouts and know where to brake and accelerate and squeeze every millisecond of performance from the car choices making it tough to stay competitive until you've personally put in the aforementioned 60+ hours. There's also a tendency for online matches to go with the 'full damage' mode where collisions will regularly destroy your vehicle or at least cause you to hobble about the course on bare rims and minimal steering control. Worse is the frequent situation where a slight mistake in the lead car of the pack will cause a massive unavoidable pile-up collision with the rest of the following. Such a thing renders all your skill and track knowledge useless... it takes such a tiny error to screw things up for the rest and sometimes you'll find yourself with a twit who purposely takes the chance to screw with you.  One special note is that demolition derby, the fun and guilty-pleasure free-download available, has a MAJOR bug in it where you will frequently discover your progress is set back an entire lap for no explainable reason at all which makes it damn near impossible to recover from. It's bad enough that demolition derby encourages people to fu** with you by willfully inflicting fishtail spinouts but this bug stacks the deck against you from the start with a frequency approaching 8 out of every 10 races having this bomb blow up in your face.   I also have a serious issue with how the corner-cutting mechanic is executed. The developers have stated in the first game they had to build indestructable barriers around the tracks in order to keep people from cutting corners and that had gameplay ramifications they wanted to avoid, so in Grid 2 the tracks are free(er) from such obstructions but if you do cut through a corner improperly you'll find your momentum immediately halted and you can't resume acceleration for a period of time 'equal to the time advantage gained by corner cutting'. That's fine... in theory. In practice it becomes very frustrating because it's possible to avoid the penalty hit if you're careful how you exit your shortcut but then there are corners where there's a wall two feet from the apex of the turn and if you drift through that two foot gap you'll be slapped down for it even though the supposed 'shortcut cheat' advantage is almost nil and the course essentially requires you to move through that gap to maintain your speed.   Is Grid 2 worth buying? I think $30 for the base game is worthy. $15 to $10 is an instant purchase. The DLC car packs are so-so... it's hard to figure out the differences between the 80(?) cars on offer so you could easily skip all the extra cars and not miss them. If the 'Reloaded' edition is on sale for less than $30 though, yeah, get that. The new tracks and routes are worth buying since they help keep the track choices from getting too repetitive.  I had lots of fun with this, and yeah.... soft-core driving porn. It's like that."
"I'm disssapointed of the controling, fix it becouse my controler wheel doesn't responds fast, I need to turn not most all the wheel to turn, fix it nahui"
"Awesome racing game, love it!"
"Where is in car view? Where is multiplayer/join local? Why do I need to do everything on racenet?  Car feels good, but I sure would like more 'PC style' game options."
"TL;DR - Vroom vroom crash sometimes but smiley face. 6/10  PRO: 1. Good arcade racing - I've spent many, many hours in this game, primarily in the multiplayer section. While it can be frustrating at times with the amount of accidents people seem to get into, I've also had a great number of tremendously fun and close races 2. Seeminly endless supply of new blood - lots of people are at or near the MP level cap (level 99), but there are usually a good number of lower levels floating about. While that mixture of levels and experience does segregate the field a bit on track (which is kind of a con really), it also evens out the gradient a bit. Also gives great opportunity for lower levels to learn which cars suit which tracks and how to corner effectively (NOT THAT THEY SEEM TO NOTICE!)  CON:  1. Very poor DLC integration - things like the Spa pack provide content that only very rarely can be used. Not many people choose to host the extra tracks in custom events, and even if they do there are often problems in joining sessions. If you don't EXACTLY match the number of DLC packs they have, you can't join their game. For single-player only guys, this isn't an issue as you can use the content at your whim, but it's been the multiplayer that kept this game going for me 2. Poor car balance - there are clear favourite cars in each of the four tiers. You can beat them in 'lesser' cars, but only if you absolutely nail every single braking point and apex of every single metre of track. Cars which are already powerful get a great number of upgrade slots, while poor cars only have space for a handful, which don't even make a difference. "
"It's NOT a simulator. It's an arcade game, not meant to be realistic. If you can get over it, it's a cool game, that gives you many hours of fun!"
"This game has a lot of quick races compared to Grid and there is an arcade type of feel. It lacks the cockpit view and is a blend of NFS underground, Dirt 2, and Grid. The Dirt 2 factor is an annoying announcer and goofy menus. Where this game shines is that it smacks down every NFS title on this platform. It lacks upgrades to vehicles but that can be forgiven due to the great exhaust sounds and eye candy. If you want longer races and better handling go pick up Grid. If you want some quicker racing and some drifting this is a great game. You may even prefer the handling it's just more arcadish and you can smack your car around a bit more. The DLC is mostly just more cars and this is where your upgrades were hidden. Oh you wanted to upgrade your ride like on NFS underground well that will be $4.99. It's still a bit pricey even when bundled together but it compliments a solid title."
"Sorry, but the first rounds of this game is terrible.. There's isnt a good grip on the road and thats why this review is negative, sorry, but this game feels utter garbage with the horrible grip."
amazing game. fast and fluid on a good system. fun with friends. definitely worth playing.
"Pretty cool game, but the handling is ♥♥♥♥... :/"
"Never got into the original, was always a project gotham/gran turismo fan. Ticks most the boxes for me  The Good  +Sense of speed +Graphics +Easy to run +Interesting tracks, not too much chatter between races +Fun to play +Nice balance of arcade racing but you can feel the car under you +No stupid racing lines  The bad  -lack of cars -DLC car packs(Yuk) -Has a rewind feature -You can buy car packs for online gameplay.  Overall if you are looking for a decent fun racing game that you don't have to put 100 hours into, this is recommended."
"of course i recommend this game. not only to humans even aliens -_- . graphics : its just awesome after a month of playing it on ultra i can just say splendid graphics the reflections are perfect the fog the sunset weather the lightnings the map texture graphics is awesome even though its a total different sort of racing game compare to NFS , this game can be competable with the latest NFS games graphics. . . . dont believe me? TRY IT OUT !!!"
VERY POSITIVE WTF this game sucks cars drift way to much and when u go over 150 mph its like they fly over road.  first game was epic but this is crap in compare.
The best arcade racing game ever! Nuff said! 10/10
"if u like arcade racing and u found out that newer need for speed games are too easy (nfs dont have manual transmission, extremely easy to drift, etc), this is ur game  though i recommend u to wait for grid autosport on sale because its like more polished version of grid 2"
An accurate simulation of what would happen if you handed a bunch of 11 year olds the keys to some high powered cars and told them to just flatten the accelerator into the first corner with all the forethought and finesse their pre-teen brains can muster. Do you like either going in a straight line or getting sweaty palms because there is a 1 degree bend in the road and the car behind you had the brake pedal listed as an optional extra that the owner was too much of a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to fork out for? Then this is the game for you!
" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv1RPr6-BA0   Grid 2 is about the role of your driver in the formation and proliferation of World Series Racing, an international racing series that encompasses several racing disciplines across a wide range of car types. While this structure makes sense in the context of the narrative it has the unfortunate side effect of wearing out each location's welcome. Each region has three or four primary race location with varying routes through each. While the tracks themselves are technically different they share sections and landmarks from tracks that you previously raced in. Spreading a dozen races across three locations where you encounter some of the same sections across various routes does not leave the impression that variety is this game's strong suit despite a track list that would indicate otherwise. Grid 2's greatest innovation is it's LiveRoute system. Basically track designs are modular and with LiveRoutes these sections of track are loaded on the fly completely randomizing the track and forcing players to react to each change since the mini map is unavailable. Each section of track comes together seamlessly without creating any awkward or impossible turns though some sections of track can be repeated several time throughout an event which really detracts from the novelty of the feature.  Vehicles embody the characteristics of their real world counterparts but sliding and drifting are much easier and emphasized but Grid 2 is devoid of the turbo boosts and jumps that characterize pure arcade racers. Ultimately it's a system that is extremely enjoyable. Muscle cars roar and and corner like hippos sprinting around a KY jelly covered skating rink. Tuners slide around like asthmatic mosquitoes as their turbos hiss and wheeze while track cars warp across the asphalt and slice through corners like razors through the wrists of a My Chemical Romance fan. Unfortunately the car count is on the small side, encompassing less than fifty of the most elite performance vehicles from the past and present. Well I should say the most elite races not to wear Porsche, Ferrari or Lamborghini badges. Customization is also limited to changing wheels and adding garish liveries to your machines. Copious sponsor stickers also spoil your vehicle's aesthetics while offering an opportunity to complete objectives that earn WSR more fans.   Togue events, Checkpoint races, Overtake events, Endurance races, Drift events, elimination races, and head to head races round out the event types. These events do an admirable job of keeping the main campaign from becoming stale. Likewise strong AI ensures that you have to work a bit for victories. You opponents can be really aggressive and full damage means that trying to play bumper cars in the corners can end your race or severely hamper your car's performance. Ricocheting off of your opponents in the first turn and holding the lead isn't as viable a strategy in Grid as it is other racing games.  Car models are appropriately detailed though they lack cockpit views. Matte, gloss, metallic and pearlescent paint are convincingly rendered and the damage models are unrivaled. Hoods, bumpers, fenders, spoilers and trunk lids can be smashed off and tires can even rupture. Geometry wrinkles and deforms after impacts in a rather convincing manner. As great as all of this is what really stands out are the tracks... Sparks from overhead subway rails shower the streets of Chicago and papers blow over the roadway, mists hover over the pavement in California as leaves blow around. Dubai's glorious skyscrapers and yachts dot the landscape. In short the tracks seem alive... It's a nice departure from the often drab and dead cityscapes that many games have you race through. The sound is also solid. Races are mostly scored with a symphony of pistons pumping like drums, turbos whistling like woodwinds and tires squealing like the string section. Exhausts howl, echoing off of mountain sides and tunnels and the echoing of your opponent’s vehicle seconds off of your lead can be intense."
"It's just so bad . First of all your car is made out of paper, but all other cars are made out of alluminium . I doesn't matter which car you pick , hell if you even had a frickin monster truck it would according to this game also be made out of paper . But that's not the worst part oh no . The worst part is the fricking handling of the cars . The cars are so out of control you would had better luck doing it in real life . Other than that there's not much to complain . It's just so dissapointing , this could have been a great racing game but it just fails on the most simplest thing's ."
Definitely one of the better racing games I have played on the PC in a while. Definitely recommend.
"Grid 2 is a really good Arcade style racing game, thoroughly recommended (especially over most of the recent Need for Speed games). Varied racing modes, decent variety of cars and mechanically it plays well. The Single Player campaign is enjoyable and lasts around 20 hours.   Multiplayer is ok, it adds more longevity to the game with a Call Of Duty style progression system. However, race events are a bit of a destruction derby where the podium positions are usually determined by whoever manages to get through the first few corners without being ran off the road by another vehicle.   I can't comment on racing wheel support or how the game plays for wheel users, I just played it using an Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed my time with it."
"This game is great for a while with a pretty good singleplayer story and fun driving physics, but it certainly has some (at times) game-breaking/ruining flaws. Although some flaws might draw you away from this game, I would probably still suggest it. HOWEVER: The Reloaded Edition is a true waste of money; half the cars just performance versions of the previous ones, and in multiplayer, (if you can find a game) DLC is almost always disabled. Also, IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  PROS: - Physics (while at times completely unrealistic) make this game for me. They're probably the most fun/realistic of many racing games I've played - Singleplayer mode is quite extensive and fun, and it lets you use most cars in the game pretty regularly - Customization might not be the best, and it has a serious flaw (as shown in cons), but it is very expansive for personalizing a car to your liking - This game adapts to your driving style very well, for example: If you prefer drifting, you know you can overtake/attack opponents at corners very effectively, while using a more powerful car with more traction lets you overtake others on straights  CONS: - Customization has a very annoying flaw: You cannot use the default liveries of your cars unless you're in multiplayer; in singleplayer the default livery is automatically applied to all vehicles without any confirmation from the player ... This actually ruins customization for me, especially being an owner of the Reloaded Edition and not being able to use the DLC liveries (but meh, the Reloaded Edition was under $30 on ♥♥♥) - The AI in this game is the worst I've seen in any game for years; AI using drift cars act exactly as others using grip cars; each AI has no personality of its own ... In addition, the AI units don't have any apparent awareness of your positon; they commit to their actions regardless of where you are, commonly resulting in them pitting you, ramming you into the side of the wall, or braking before necessary, causing you to crash into them (it is quite obvious that this is not meant to be a feature excused by 'aggressive drivers') - The multiplayer is indeed the worst I've seen of any game; not only are there very rarely players on, and if you manage to find some, DLC is always disabled, and overall its design is terrible: flashbacks (if enabled) have clearly had 5 minutes spent in their design, the AI is even worse (driving absurdly slowly, having even less awareness of you, etc.), players are able to ram you out of the way without any effect to their progress, etc ... AGAIN: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER GAME!  Despite all these flaws, I would still suggest this game for its pros; it is still a fun game and decent racing game."
"Not really sure what happened but this game is worse than GRID 1 in pretty much every way. Fewer/Lamer modes, appears not to have the driving options from GRID 1, no cockpits, DLC to play a bunch of cars... Most of the neat things about single player campaign are gone leaving you with only custom races. About the only thing positive I can say is that the I like the tracks a lot better."
10/10 would reccomend
"One of my favorites when it comes to the genre. The community don't like it because of the car handling mechanics (they tend to drift on every single turn), but I found that 'feature' quite refreshing. It was just fun - and it's the most important thing when it comes to playing a game, right? Oh, and the tracks are really various too."
" TL;DR While GRID 2 challenging and sometimes enjoyable, refusing to allow players access to more than just 'Drift' cars unless they purchase cut-content style DLC ultimately ruins the experience."
The slightly aggressive AI and stunning graphics are just awesome!
Horrible arcade where your car weights like a car and opponents are running trams.
It's a fun arcade racing game.  Pros: Fast passed game.  Custom paint job for each car.  Various challenges.  You can progress the game even if you don't like a challenge.  Various cars.  Correct feeling after your car is damaged. (make sure you have this option on)  Cons: If you hit another car (or another car hits you) you will slide and most of the times and get off-track. Even if it's not your fault  Expensive DLCs   Too much drift.  Seems like the AI cars follow a specific route in circuits no matter what.  No camera from inside the car!
amazing racing game! its awesome.
yes not that good but ok
"Great cars, great tracks! Solid car fizzix! Codemasters did a great job! "

Fun game if you are into racing. Codemasters always does good when it comes to racing games.
"GRID was a continuation of the story-driven racer in which you play the central role of a burgeoning raw driving talent, making your way from one event to the next.  GRID 2's handling model feels tighter and slightly more accessible than in the first GRID, and while the rival AI seems a little more forgiving, it's still incredibly aggressive, especially in the later seasons. while you're relegated to the back of the pack, Surely if you're consistently winning races, you should be starting in pole position too?  When you do inevitably crash, you can use a Flashback, which makes a welcome comeback for GRID 2, in a far more streamlined guise. Difficulty once again dictates how many Flashbacks you have at your disposal, with normal giving you a generous five. We still managed to regularly use these all up though.  Not only has Flashback been refined, but the entire game has been stripped down to brass tacks. Sadly that means you're no longer free to surf eBay for bargain cars, and in fact shopping for rides has been dispensed with entirely. Now you're simply granted cars for completing races, presented with a choice of two very similar models from different manufacturers at certain junctures. You can then win the second car through completing a vehicle challenge in which you have to beat the target time in a hot lap.  Multiplayer features all of the various racing modes from career, including Checkpoint, Touge, Drift, Elimination, Race, Overtake and so on, and spreads them across the single-player online Global Challenges - that can be completed at your leisure each week - and the more traditional competitive multiplayer aspect. This all has a persistent levelling system, with levelling up granting access to newer and better cars, while any cash you gain can be used to purchase upgrades for your rides.  GRID 2 is a more than worthy. Yes, the lack of a cockpit view is somewhat disappointing, but when the handling and controls are so tight and enjoyable, it's hard to complain. Add to that some blistering visuals with truly stunning lighting, and you have one of this current generation's finest racing titles. Not just that, but GRID 2 might just be the last truly great racing game of this generation."
"I had the original Grid on xbox along with Forza 3 and while Forza puts you to sleep playing it Grid kept you wide awake. To this day Grid is the only racing game i've played where you actually get a real sense of speed when racing.  Grid 2 isn't as good as the first, they took a few things out like being able to spectate when waiting to race when a session has already started (you can now only spectate if you had already been playing and crashed/retired) . I also don't like the interface either.  Car handling is similar to the first Grid but maybe slightly easier? i still get the same sense of speed playing this that i did playing the first one, so in that sense it's just as addictive for me playing it.  Graphics with everything turned up to max only really seem marginally improved over the original (but then the first one looked great to begin with), I guess the smoke effects have improved and the exhaust heat.  I should warn people actually that if you buy it now you really need to buy the car DLC as well to stand a chance in a race as you have to level up to buy certain tiers of cars. If you don't have certain cars unlocked you will only be able to realistically come 6th place in a race, you won't be able to win or come in the top 3 that's for sure. Also what's ridiculous is you can only unlock tier 4 cars (highest tier supercars) when you are in the mid 20 ranks. I am rank 31 right now and put in about 70 hours of play time, so you are looking at playing for 50ish hours to unlock the last tier of cars without DLC. The game does loan you a car if you don't have one for the required tier but the one they loan you for tier 4 is terrible, can't steer or turn to save its life. The cars they loan you for tier 2 and 3 are fine, tier 1 not so much.  If you played and liked the first game you will probably like this, if you haven't played the first one i'd wait till it's on sale to try it out as it's a polarizing ARCADE game (not a sim) as you might not like the fairly simplistic car handling.  But saying all that, the sheer sense of speed you get while playing it you can't get anywhere else, and that's what does it for me which is why i'm addicted to this racer.  7.5/10"
Perfect mixture of Sim and arcade. Vehicle ratings are not correct to real life (ie cars are faster/slower in game than real car performance)
When you fly off a cliff you can reverse time and not fall again.  10/10
This game is 1/2 Retail an another 1/2 DLC version ! Shame on you Codemasters !!!
"There are several racing games out there.   Some are realistic, simulating the hardcore aspects of driving, correct braking and approach to turns.   Some are fantastic, with weapons and whatnot turning the racetrack into a hectic battlefield of missiles and banana peels.  Some are inbetween, focusing on keeping the pedal to the metal and powersliding your way through the race and to the podium.  GRID 2 is not like any of these games.  GRID 2 is about second chances.  GRID 2 is about besting yourself in every race.  GRID 2 is about mastering every car and every driving style.  GRID 2 is about incredibly awesome, high speed overtakes.   GRID 2 is about doing turns at 200 km/h with both left tires empty.  GRID 2 is about keeping your car straight when it has no front wheels.   GRID 2 is about having fun."
well...... yah steam sucks !! found nothing about gred 2 crashing (from steam or grid websit ) at the logo  wtf ppl i paid 30$ for that and no helping ??? thats make me mad what a customer service is this ! tell me steam  do i need to redownload the game every 5 mins -hell no- thats 6GB or so     from my heart : mad customer
Great fun - highly recommended!
GREAT GAME stunning graphics  nice cars good multiplayer  i would recomend this to anyone :) 
Definitely one of the better racing games I have played on the PC in a while. Definitely recommend.
"Grid 2 is a really good Arcade style racing game, thoroughly recommended (especially over most of the recent Need for Speed games). Varied racing modes, decent variety of cars and mechanically it plays well. The Single Player campaign is enjoyable and lasts around 20 hours.   Multiplayer is ok, it adds more longevity to the game with a Call Of Duty style progression system. However, race events are a bit of a destruction derby where the podium positions are usually determined by whoever manages to get through the first few corners without being ran off the road by another vehicle.   I can't comment on racing wheel support or how the game plays for wheel users, I just played it using an Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed my time with it."

A top racing simulator. Its got a comprehensive career mode and the graphics are as good as you would expect from a modern Codemasters title. A high class game that's difficult to fault.
"   this is the best game to ever exsist because of it having my name in it     The game has very nice graphics, smooth fps, and great controlls, thats all i have to say      BUY IT DAM YOU!!!"
One thing to say go buy Grid 1 it as cockpit view and that was why i liked Grid Game and codemaster racing games because cars were farely easy to control and it had cockpit view besides that the game was solid.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_RLYNB8XE 
"One of the best racing games if you have a Mac. Also, the maps are really good."
endless+ out of 10 'Vtec kicked in yo'
"At first i hated how hard drifting was. But after few hours i loved it. Realistic car sounds, difficult controls, great visuals and most important - split screen!"
"First to say, I really don't like playing racing games. I tried this some time ago with mouse and keyboard and maybe one hour later I gave up and uninstalled a game. But now I got controller and it is completly different. Just finished the third seasson and game is really fun. A lot of cars to choose. I like the rewind feature. Some of the maps are really beautiful (dubai) and graphics overall is very nice. Game consist of a lot of racing modes also with I believe some completly optional which adds fans or cars, it is a nice feature. One thing that I do not like is that no matter in which position I end in previous races, I almost all time starting at last position and in some situations is really hard to get to the top from that."
Cooles Game
Awesome game! Realistic Graphics and Realistic Racing.
Better than Dirt showdown lulz x0x0x0x
"A very nice game! Sure at the beginning u have to get used to it, but it becomes a lot of fun, especially if u play it on a lanparty with friends!  +!"
Cool Game
"The differences between Grid1 and Grid2 are totally awesome! The first one, it is about the graphics, Grid2 has an excellent graphic quality even on slow hardwares. About the multiplayer, Grid2 can offer to its users a great experience almost perfect. And better, Grid2 is possible find a good one with a cheap price."

"Sweet, sweet racing game. Really enjoying this so far. Also, just earning badges, lmao."
"GRID 2 is one of the best driver games I ever have played, and the most fun driver game I know. Race against your friends, beat your pwn highscores, play many of the gamemodes and much more. There is always something to do in GRID 2.  GRID 2 is a skill based driver game, which I liked very much. It is very great to see a driver game, where you needs to learn how to control the car. This gave me new challenges, which I enjoyed a lot.  If you prefer to play Single Player, the game also has a Carrer Mode. I enjoyed the Carrer Mode from start to the end. You're starting as a driver, who not has many fans and not many sponsors. But every match you win, every season you win will more sponsers get interested in you and more fans will come. It's like being a real driver. The goal is being the best driver in the world, and winning all 'World Series Racing' which is the seasons.   GRID 2 will only give you a great experience, and it is recommended so much if you like driver games.   "
"Great arcade racing game with beautiful graphics. It has a career mode, local and online multiplayer, different racing modes and lots of licensed cars."
yes not that good but ok
"Barrel Roll 10/10 Be warned! No racing lines!   + Graphics + Tracks + Car Tier 1,2,3 + Multiplayer + Windscreen wipers turn on when off the track + Damage physics  - AI, stupid morons - Driving sideways in tier 4. - No first person cam from cockpit"
"It's alright if you want a mix between arcade and simulation, I prefer the original Grid because this one is too arcadey."
Hi.  I like this game very much. It has beatifull graphics and a very good engine so it is able to run on my pc (intel core i5 3rd generation and intel hd graphics 4000) on medium with min 30 fps!  I like this game very much and it is worth every penny.  Bye
There are lots of better racing games out there...
!
One of the best racing games on the market! but with a slight draw back of the fact you can't enter driver cam without mods! apart from that this is a must have game!
"  Long story cut short:it is good.Really,really,really good."
"Half of the stuff are DLC, I don't like this situation."
"I just picture some central casting area with a bunch of guys in wraparound Oakleys, soul patches and/or half goatees, a 3/4 backwards Monster Energy baseball cap and a jersey of some kind, all desperately pleading with a single video game producer for them to be the next voice of the newest random extreme sports game like jet-skating or wind-flying or kite-masturbating.   Yeah, it's one of those games, where someone who just snorted a bunch of coke in an ADR booth off an intern is telling you how many social media followers you've just earned by power-sliding over 100 feet.   If you're in 8th place prepare to be ♥♥♥♥-shamed by an LA producer's idea of what should motivate the target divorced father of six with dreams of running Daytona and a $20,000 gaming rig demographic.  This game creates a ridiculous and jarringly inconsistant world of high stakes street-racing that seems to be sponsored by Microsoft, as they have the money to shut down the city of Chicago so you can place dead last in a junky old ford.   It's 'edgy' as defined by a room full of white forty-year old men.  Anyway, everything is shiny and the things smash up real good so you should buy it on sale for $.99   Just turn off the announcers."
"In short: Great racing game.  Longer version: You're being discovered as a talent in motor sports by Patrik Calahan and he tells you about this idea he's been having: WSR - World Series of Racing. In order to make this idea come true he would need a guy who could persuade different driving clubs over the world to participate in the series. So... The first season you're driving in the US, the second one in Europe, the third one in Asia... and the fourth one is the best drivers combined. What 'grinds my gears' is that the fifth season makes the game SOMEWHAT outstaying its welcome, it doesn't need the fifth season since it's pracically the fourth one but with some faster cars.  Also... Codemasters decided to remove the cockpit view. WHY?!?! It's the best one.  But I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun (arcadey) racing game."
"Not a simulation but definately one of the best arcade racing game i have played.  Great Graphic optimisation , Drift to Win what actually need skills and makes a lot of fun racing on it , Xbox 360 Controller friendly so you don't need some bomb equipment to be able to race clean , great tracks and cars incluiding all those DLC Contents to. Moding posible 'only for singleplayer aloved' !  I give it a 10/10 as i never get any problems with it , spent a lot of hours playing it and enjoyed every second on it.  Bad on it is only if you play MP with a bad looby where you catch a lot Rammer's and not skilled driver's , but this is not a codemaster's fail !   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=216599542   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=272200570   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=272609462  More Videos i have recorded can be seen here:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/speed-junky/videos/?appid=44350 "
"sometimes the tracks and races can be repetitive but overall I love ths game, good gfx, good story line in caeree mode and great gameplay, I keep coming back to it"
This is probably the worst racing game I've ever played...
"Though it is somewhat enjoyable, I cannot recommend this game. After six hours of playing, I can say that every new race just adds frustration and disappointment.  The AI is a nightmare Sunday afternoon. Whenever a corner comes along, they all slam on their brakes in syncronization and take it at a driving-school safe speed. When not on a corner, they form a massive rolling roadblock between you and the 'chosen one;' the AI who started in first. Except in very rare cases, the AI do not trade positions.  If you are tired of the AI, you can try a gate-to-gate race, where every time you pass a truck you get points, every truck you pass increases the points given by the next truck, and losing paint resets the combo. However, you will soon find that the truck drivers are the same AI drivers, except after having been out partying and drinking all night. They have no ability to maintain their lane and seem determined to slam into you as you try to pass.  There are three types of cars. Drift, Grip, and Balanced. To me, drift seems to be like trying to drive a greased whale on ice, grip is the absolute reverse (whatever that may be. A rough shark in sand?), and balanced is so far in the middle that it is incapable of either drifting or gripping. Probably with more practice I could make any of the cars perform, but I simply don't care to.   In summary, I would suggest downloading the demo and just playing that. It's free and has most of the experience of the full game."
I like it :D and the graphics
This is probably the worst racing game I've ever played...
"I absolutely love this game! I am especially thrilled that it runs on my laptop, which has 'ok' graphics. I haven't tried the multiplayer, so if you're into that, you might want to check some other reviews."
"Did not like it one bit. I use a Logitech G27, and I've got to say the way the game handles is just bad. When I clutch kick it'll put me back in neutral, and that just sucks. Nothing really feels 'real' about this game at all. I'll be going back to NFS Shift until I can find something better."
"Ive played it for a while on Steam Free Weekend, and its cool. The cars have an amazing sound and good quality, that tracks are slick and challenging, but the handling on the game is really awkward, which kinda ruins it. :( But its a really good racing game, and I would recommend this game to anyone. :)"
"I was really sceptic against this game before release, but quickly changed my mind when I started playing it. What I wanted was a sophisticated racing simulator, much like the first GRID. What I got was nothing like it, but to my surprise they still did an excellent job. I would call this an arcade game more so than simulator, but it is hell of a good one. No comments on the overpriced and overpowered DLC cars..."
Beautiful graphics and competitive racing the game looks and feels great couldn't ask for more in a racer.
0/10 bs pos game would not recommend
"This is WITHOUT DOUBT the greatest driving game that has ever been released on PC that is called GRID 2.  Seriously, I'm not even joking. No other game released for the PC called GRID 2 comes close."

"highly arcade, far away from a racing simulator."
Nothing like the first grid game. badly made game.
"I beat Harrison Carter and Bruno Silva in every race, they never retired 10/10"
"Awesome car game.Bit wonky on the online upgrade system,but enjoyable campaign and very nice variety of cars."
"Grid 2 I think its a really fun racing arcade game. Codemasters is fast becoming one of my fav and go to for racing games. Dont understand all of the hate for codemasters and Grid 2. Sure Grid 2 has some issues and things wrong. The bottom line is that Grid 2 is fun and entertaining. The smoke effects are some of the best I have seen. The cars are cool and the track, although some times repetitive are fun to drive. LOVE U CODEMASTERS!!!!"
"Look, I'm not all that coordinated anymore. I get that. It happens with old age. We fall down. We drop things. We lose our dentures. I want to die sleeping peacefully, not like the other screaming passengers in my car. But if I'm awake, there's one thing I can still do well and that's drive.   If real cars had physics like this, no one would be able to stay on the road and I've raced vehicles before. These ice skates with axles handle horribly. They don't turn or brake worth a darn. Tapping on the brakes will send the car suddenly careening off 90 degrees in some random direction. It would be easier to drive a pinball than these tings. I've tried this game from hard to very easy and the handling isn't much different. Cars just can't stay on the road. Bumping another car - even if you hit their back quarter panel on a turn - will send your car careening off wildly while their car isn't impacted at all. I guess Newton's Second Law does not exist in the GRID2 universe.  The most important things about any racing game are the driving and physics. GRID2 seems to have forgotten both. Perhaps it is different with a wheel, but with a gamepad I find it unplayable. It smacks of a poor console port and you can do better for your money. This game isn't worth your time or your dollars."
This is a great game ! Worth buying

 One of my personal favourites when it comes to racing games.
"GRID 2 Is A Cool Racing Game, But the Car is too hard to Control even in GamePad.  ★ Good Graphics ★ ★ Good Car Customization Mod ★ ★ Fair Gameplay ★ ★ Hard to Steer ★  (7/10)"
"Grid 2 is way way!!! Better than Grid Autoslow  To define the difference between the two, it's like Quake vs Counter Strike, Quake being fast pace and in your face, and CS being slow and boring...  Long live Grid 2 because Grid Autoslow community is just about dead going by steam's statistics"
"Game starts off with a Mustang Mach 1, and the thing about it is that the car is like a typical mustang at a car meet. Aside from the bad steering from the most of the cars which annoys me alot, overall, the gameplay is amazing. 8/10 "
"Didn't grab me as much as the first incarnation but still a damn fine racing game. Codemasters need to lose the race guy progression story and concentrate on actual content. I love the look and feel of these games and as racing games go they are my best. If you like a balanced racing game then go right ahead, just ignore the waffle and you'll be fine.  Must play!"

looking for realistic graphics? buy this game
"I'm no racing expert, but I've played a lot of racing games since my first Intellivision in the early 80's. Grid 2 is very good. Just like another CodeMasters gem, Dirt 3, this has beautiful graphics that still look beautiful when running Grid 2 on a laptop with an Intel HD 4000 GPU. This also integrates perfectly with the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers for PC.  When I'm on the Xbox, it's Forza, but on PC, it's Grid 2."
One of my favourite Racing games. Some features are missing from the predecessor but that´s not bad. The driving is very arcade-oriented. The singleplayer is really good and motivational. The multiplayer is good too and there are still people who playing it.  Conclusion:  An awsome Racing game. Highly recommended.
"Game starts off with a Mustang Mach 1, and the thing about it is that the car is like a typical mustang at a car meet. Aside from the bad steering from the most of the cars which annoys me alot, overall, the gameplay is amazing. 8/10 "
"Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥³  Singleplayer is nice, nice cars overall good racing game. GRID 1 is still better imo, i dislike the DLC's"
"Let me start this by saying that you shouldn't expect the game to be anything like its predecessor, its car handling and driving style are completely dumbed down to a point where it can actually be comparable to the likes of Need for Speed. If you want to take every corner with a silly exaggerated drift and don't like in car cameras then this is for you. Hold off for GRID Autosport and see what thats like."
It doesnt even let me play without signing up for 10 things. This is the least accessible game I've seen. After messing with it for a few minutes I decided it's best to uninstall this game and never revisit it. You aren't missing much here. You thought you wanted sick races and drifting but instead you found a smelly pile of raccoon ♥♥♥♥ and you don't know why. I don't know why either. Don't spend money on this.
"When I was looking at some information on this game, I found a quote from Codemasters in relation to the length of time it would take to complete Grid 2. This game is supposed to take more than 30 hours to complete.   “We’ve noticed a trend in recent years with some of the supposedly ‘big’ games that were actually six hours long, and we didn’t feel that was sufficient value for money for our fans at all. We wanted to make sure there was so much more for them to do.”   Normally I would complete a game prior to reviewing it, but in this instance I could not bring myself to do it. I will start with the cons first as this will give me some time to think of something good that this game has to offer.   Cons:     Realism in this game has gone out the window. Codemasters pride themselves in the amount of effort they spend on realism in their F1 series. Unfortunately this is the only series that has remained true to its original. The original grid game was a lot of fun and on both the Xbox and PC version I have spent untold hours playing (mainly drifting) and hat a lot of fun. This game just doesn’t have the same appeal. Even The Colin McRae series died along with Colin Dirt 1 was the last of the series that was any good. Dirt 2 was supposed to be a homage to Colin McRae, but it was appalling.     Drifting: DRIFTS ARE NOT POPPING THE HANDBRAKE AND DOING A LITTLE SLIDE ROUND THE CORNER. Grid was so much fun when it came to the drift challenges. There was nothing more satisfying than pulling off a linked chain of drifts for an entire lap and then watching the replay for that satisfaction. All you do in this game is pull the handbrake (or E-Brake) coming in to a corner, do a little slide, drive up to the next corner and repeat. You cannot keep drifts going in this game. For those of you that are looking at buying this game to relive those font memories of drifting around an entire track but with revised graphics, don’t bother. Just like me, you will be sorely disappointed.     Your friendly AI team coordinator that is in your ear every race: Even if your mechanical knowledge is strictly limited to knowing where the fuel goes in to your car, you will find the commentators remarks cringe worthy. Unfortunately when he first introduced himself at the start of the game, something in the back of my mind was telling me that this game was not going to live up to its predecessor.     It’s not fun: There are 2 types of games, ones that you look at the time and think; “gees, is that the time, I should have eaten 5 hours ago” and those that make you look at the clock like you are at work and are waiting impatiently for 5:00 so you can go home and do something FUN. Grid 2 falls in to the latter category.      No cockpit view… Not that it matters in an arcade racer… But it was a real game it would need an in car view.    Pros  Pro     It looks pretty.  Codemasters should look at creating entire new games when they want to change from realism to arcade, instead of leeching off the popularity of their previous games and developing cruddy arcade racers. Basically, this game would be better if they didn’t call it Grid 2 and get everyone’s hopes up.  "
"The first version are awesome, And this? Shiiiiiit ♥♥♥♥ing dope asf."
"I'm very disappointed by this game. But first the good parts:  - graphics are quite good and the game runs smoohly on my low-end gaming notebook - sound is quite good too - controls and drifts are quite nice. you have to get used to it I guess. It's challenging, but doable.  Bad parts  - no story (except 'ok, go drive and make fame') - no characters (except their voices.. but you never ever see a human being but the crowds behind their fences) - rewind option. you need this a lot. every time an opponent hits you you have a 50% change to do a 180 turn. And the feature is no fun at all. You think undoing your failures makes the game more entertaining? no, it doesn't. you get a second chance and screw up again -&gt; rewind -&gt; try again. yay... - menu. there's not much wrong with the menu, but there's just so much clutter and so many confirmation dialogs you'll learn to confirm without even thinking about it. - no tuning (in career) - no freakin' camera view of the car while painting it or changing the wheels?! (the only parts you can change) REALLY?! i tried mouse, the race-view keys. NADA. how am i supposed to chose a paint without seeing the FKin car?"
"There are many better racing games on the market and very few more pointless.  This takes what was good about the first Grid and turns it down a notch, so they could spend more time designing a menu screen that would look at home on a Need for Speed game.   Originality is not a selling point of this title, nor is the racing.   Graphically it's alright, nothing that will save it from a sale purchase at best. That is of course once you manually change the replay file to read-only so you don't suffer stuttering throughout the race, once again the customers solve the lazy devs work.   Is it good? No, is it worth buying? If you own GRID, Need for Speed, Dirt... No...  CTRL-C, CTRL-V racing at it's worst."
"I bought this game on Steam winter sale and it's the best racing game ever made! I'll buy Grid Autosport and Dirt Rally once I'm done with this and when I get a new PC.  I feel like Drift King in this game, I don't like the drift races but in other races drifting around the corners is so much fun."
It doesnt even let me play without signing up for 10 things. This is the least accessible game I've seen. After messing with it for a few minutes I decided it's best to uninstall this game and never revisit it. You aren't missing much here.

" Graphics:  The graphics looks really nice and I'm on a older GPU, GTX260 and it still looks really good even if it's now maxed, with sparks flying when someone rolls their car or crashes into a wall.   Sound/Soundtrack:  The sound are good i must say, especially the crash noise, which if you drive like me hear pretty often. You can hear what other cars are doing around you even if you don't see them. The sound track tho, the first thing i did was to go in the menu and turn it off, haven't turned it on since i started it the first time.   Handling:  The handling isn't great, the car tends to drift way to much and when drifting have super tires that can grip anything, but if you see it from an arcade point of view it's not to bad, there is worse but there are worse. I do find the handling of the destruction derby cars to be better then the other cars, they actually feel heavy.   Multiplayer:  Here is where GRID 2 shines, many different game modes, from racing, drifting to destruction derby. And it's easy to create a lobby and start a game and you can create a mini league with up to 5 races which is super nice.   Cockpit view:  This is a hot one, when i first heard it i disregarded the game totally, but when i got i and started driving, it isn't something i really miss, sure i use it when playing Assetto Corsa and GTR2, but they are a completely different genre. The hood view is in my opinion just as good or even better in this type of game.   DLC:  I don't have any numbers here, but it feels like half the cars are DLC packs, which is totally rubbish, there are 11 pay DLC packs on steam 11!! That's like 10 to much. If i buy a game i want all the content. Soon Codemaster will starting to slice up the F1 games, knock on wood...   Tracks/Cars:  As said above there aren't many cars unfortunately, you've got your standard European BMW, American Muscle, some JDM, but it's not much. And for tracks i was disappointed, i usually like proper race tracks, but there are so few (without DLC) that the only tracks i tend to race are the A to B tracks.   Overall:  If you look at it for what it is and not for what it's predecessor was, it's a very fun game to play with your mates, get a lobby full of 12 people and just race. If you don't mind the drift handling it has and the lack of cars and tracks and like me find it for a fiver, it's definitely worth it.  And for you hardcore GRID1 fans wait to see what Grid Autosport may have to offer."
"I can tell its worth the 30 dollars; I bought it for 15 dollars with all the dlcs I think. Pretty good graphics, cool gameplay, and until now at 11 hours of gameplay I havent finish the single player campaign yet. You can travel through time! only backwards tho but still."
"I've had alot of fun in Grid 2! The game gives a great racing experience, and plenty of content and (side races). I do recommend using a controller though because it is awkward using keys for driving. Once this goes below $10 during a steam sale make sure to jump on it because this game is a awesome!"
This is a Rage Review. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN IN THIS GAME. The end.
"It's amazing game with amazing graphics, beautiful cars and tracks.You can choose between many events: race, checkpoint, drift, touge, endurance.There are also four tiers of cars, which have great controling and physics.And the last great thing is, that you can try your driving skills online with friends and other players, that's why I recommend this game, for players who love   driving simulators.It's just my opinion. "
Absolutely amazing game. That's it.

"If you have played this and dont like it, you probably touch children"
"Like Race Sims but don't like all the tweaking you have to do to the cars? Like racing but your just not that good at it? This game is for you! I use to love racing on the consoles, but when I went PC the racing game are just too real. over all Race sims aren't very forgiving. Because of that I just gave then up. After reading that the Grid series is more of a 'arcade' game I thought I would give it a shot. I bought Grid 2 because of the number of tracks and the price. Highly recommended to thoses that just want to race and have fun. Graphicly its beutiful as well!"
"The graphics are really nice for this game, the car control feels the same as grid 1 with some minor improvements. The story section (world series) I've only done a few races but so far seems decent.   The multiplayer has alot of fun when you get into a full room.  Not sure on how many modes there are to do, there seems to be a few but only raced so far.   The amount if cars is decent and could do with more.  The audio of the game are good, from the engines to tyre screeching around roads.   The little features are cool like a car infront if you wipes out goes through grass and sand and covers the road in smoke nice. There are a few things that I like but otherwise it is an improvement of grid 1.   All I can say really. I hope for more cars but I know they will be paid DLC.   If you enjoy grid 1 then you will enjoy this.    Worth the cheap price for this game £26 and that's a bloody good price specially on this game.   Grid is a superb game and so is grid 2."
"All in all I would recommend this game... BUT !! There are some issues.. 1) Where on Earth going side by side with another car makes you unable to turn your car AWAY from the other car ??? Soooo annoying... 2) The Arcade style is a bit too much I would say, definetley too much disadvantage of not having a wheel, cuz the buttons sometimes cause funny and unrealistic accidents, and then you'll have to use a FLASHBACK, which is the dumbest thing in a car game... Learn to drive.. 3) AI is often stupid, and on higher Tiers they don't stand a chance, but you always have to fight through them, zig-zagging all the time.. which is fine... 4) Multi... The cars are way too unpredictable and sensitive, so even if you don't want to cause any trouble for the other players, there will always be lots of accidents, not to mention the intentional T-bones and FishTails...  On the Contrary, the game feels just about right, and with practicing a track a few times you can constantly set your lap records, the cars are awesome, the maps offer a wide variety, you can find which suits you.  Btw DLC cars are pretty damn powerful..."
"So a quick 'review'. PROs and CONs first. Then some comments &amp; random notes I have about the game. (note, my #/10 score =  MY ENJOYMENT  + minimal thought of gameplay+graphics/sound+story etc.. )   PROs:"
This game is really good. I really like the graphics and the cars!
"Great game, a lot better than Grid 1 and the option to put videos straight to youtube. Also the tracks are more interesting now."
"This game is actually one of the best out of the racing series that I played, the graphis - brilliant, the gameplay - well made, not boring at all, always some sort of action. Nice cars. Very enjoyable. Great game!"
"Grid 2 is a fun racing game! If you want a arcade game more than a simulator, this is the best choice. The handling of the cars is more arcade than simulation. Very fun, many cars to choose from. Multiplayer is good aswell, recommended!"
Love it. Wish we had more cars for the demo derby.
If your a fan of the old toca game's like i am i highly recommend u get Grid 2   pros: graphic are great game play is fun   cons: none
good gameplay  nice graphics  8.5/10 #
"A highly robust racing game. Appeals to both hardcore and casual alike. It's very much focused on the racing - there's no extra clutter. There is however, a great deal of variety in the event types and the tracks - so it's not just a boring race round circuits. Handling is excellent - very accessible for racing game newbies but deep enough to be fun and satisfying for more experienced players. Graphics are decent too - especially the lighting. But if you have an Xbox 360, then there is absolutely no reason to buy this game over Project Gotham Racing 4."
Surprising lack of features and functionality compared to the first game. Avoid at all costs.
"Its good, except for all the times its not."
"Make no mistake, GRID 2 has gone in a different direction from it's predecessor. No dash cam, no optional assists, and more aggressive AI. But even if you are a sim fan, don't let this prevent you from picking up this game.   The sense of speed is amazing, the multiplayer is addicting, and track and car options are just right. If you are an arcade racer, it's a great challenge and a rewarding game. If you are sim racer, it's a great break to play with friends while not sacrificing your knowledge of cars. Codemasters has one again made a must-play racing experience."
"Good - Fun driving, Track design, Graphics and sound. Bad - Boring Career mode, Few Tracks, Unfair MP, Tedious Menus.  If you like the driving in Codemasters previous racing games like DiRT and the first GRID pick this one up!"
"I'm really enjoying the game and haven't had as much fun in a racing game since the original Grid. If you are looking for a fun racing game with a variety of racing modes then this is the game for you. The graphics look good, the cars all handle differently and the game is a lot of fun."
"A pointless buy, there's no one playing on line anymore"
"Just played Grid 2 for the first time ever.... I swear most boring game ever..  -_____- I got through the first mission, and was already bored... Graphics are horrible they might look 'good' but really they suck, cars don't even look real! Everytime u hit the brakes even just a tap especially with my g27 car slides all over like a car in 2 wheel drive sliding in snow, w/o traction... It's a ♥♥♥♥ing joke... Spent $19 on that ♥♥♥♥ game. Wow.."
"They All Say GRID 2, is Worst than GRID 1, But I say Both Look Different Both are Great Driving Games!"
DOWNHILL MAPS+TOUGE=WOULD TOUGE AGAIN 10/10
"Its good, except for all the times its not."
"♥♥♥♥ inverted physics. If you get used to them they're still ♥♥♥♥. Like tightening screws anticlockwise. At least the major steering lag from GRID is gone And during WSR event as the last lap starts there suddenly comes some music which ruins the concentration No setup, no cockpit/dashboard cam, no clean online players  Otherwise good. Not good enough to give positive review"
One of the best racing games ever !

"Grid 2 give you the most incredible experience behind the wheel.  In spite of being focused on a touring concept, it has the largest choice of cars and tracks on the urban and mountain territory, where you can race on a ford focus or on a bmw in midtown chicago or drift them in the mountains of japan.  Grid 2 brings the old school muscle cars, the brand new urban cars, the fastest touring cars, mixing them and put you into a test of different race modes, like drift, sprint, lap race, endurance, etc, giving you a total experience of racing your way to the top.  The multiplayer is outstanding, unfortunately since the release of Grid Autosport, the number of players have decreased but believe me guys, Grid 2 is even more worthy to buy because its more versatile and not so 'one dimensional' like autosport is, only focusing his gameplay on touring. Btw, the demolition derby free dlc is awesome and just gave me a ton of good laughs when i smash my friends!"
Visually it is very well done. After that you could not have a more on-rails gaming experience.   No customization to improve the cars performance so you just pick the best car to win each circuit. I have reached the second championship and not much has changed since the beginning.
Really enjoying this car racing game. Awesome graphics and the car handling feels good. Try the demo and get it on sale if you can :) 8.5/10
"VROOOMMMMMMM VROOOOMMMM *fast car sound fx*. If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1 - 10, I'd rate it. Cheese-sandwich."
I really loved this game. The visuals were the best visuals I have ever seen in a video game and I loved playing this game online with my friends.
"@12hrs &amp; 25hrs: Lacks, to name a few; in-depth team co-pilot aspect, creative track design, vehicle selection and driving physics of the original GRID and instead replaces them with a team-less racing game based around a social media theme that has you racing against faceless rubber-band AI opponents."
"this game is awesome, but if you are looking for a game like GRID (the original) with drifting and fun you got the wrong game.  if you are looking for a Car game with awesome graphics and good controls and feel... this is absolutly the game for you, but... always the but... if you are looking for something like GRID 1 don't buy this,"
totally awesome with controller pc
"Graphic, sound are good, damage physics is good. But the most important thing in racing games, Car physics (control) is really bad.  It's no where near simulation. It's somewhere near arcade, but it's not. It's like... somewhere between them and it's awful. In this game, you go through corners faster with drifting than braking and following the racing lines. It's ok for arcade style, but then it tries to be like simulation, tiny error will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you lose places or even crash your car (that's why there is rewind feature?). This control will make you very frustrated when you go deeper in the career mode (when your cars are faster and facing harder components).  May be you can do better after practicing more with this game. But when you played another racing games, no matter it's simulation type like F1 2013 or arcade type like NFS, you will find it hard to adapt to this controls. It's very unique that no racing game is similar to this.  This game shows potential but it's totally ruined by its car physics."
An insult to racing games..
"Very polished and great looking racing game. The initial limited tracks are annoying but the dynamic tracks keep things interesting. Goals, objectives, trendy social media faux link-ins and customizations keep the game interesting and alive. 9/10"
no cockpit view it sucks
"FANTASTIC Game, if you liked GRID then you will LOVE GRID 2!"
"I'm greatly enjoying this game. Love the handling - reminds me of PGR. Runs really smooth with my HD 7870. I'd go as far as to claim that this is the best looking Racing Game available at this moment - since Need for Speed Rivals has been crippled to 30fps and Forza 5 has been downgraded to accomodate to the Xbox One's lacklustre performance ;P  My only gripe with GRID 2 so far is its businessmodel and pricing - there should have been no pre-order incentives to begin with - since there is no shortage of supply or shipping cost when it comes to digital distribution. I shouldn't be paying more just because I choose to buy the game during the week of its release rather than paying ahead of release... I simply like to be able to access the stuff I buy immediately once I put my money on the table. In addition I'm not a big fan of microtransactions only devalue the initial purchase and make people hold out for Sales and Collectors Editions... which I did. Aside from being rather pervasively integrated into this game - most of the car-pacs seem to be variations on the cars you can unlock in the game - thus don't seem to affect the balance of the game. The one DLC that does offer something interesting (Destruction Derby) comes at no additional cost. It appears that some Tier 3 cars which you should be able to win in career mode are locked away behind some nasty difficultiy spike - but thankfully you are able to switch difficultiy in the options at any time during your career which negates the frustration.  I'm having a blast with this game so far - the WSR is a brilliant idea and provides a lot of diversity and motivation. There's a distinct Street Race Action-Movie feel to the game and its events which make it very cohesive - though its gritty Sepia tone and Hollywood Soundtrack may not be for everyone... but this is more down to personal preference and subjecitve perception. The Car demolition and aggressive AI work really well and add an additional layer to the challenge.  I'm not missing the Cockpit View all that much, since I don't use it for racing - In other games I mostly use it to check out the interiors - it kinda adds to the feel of driving a real car. Maybe with the arrival of Occulus Rift the Cockpit View will become relevant once again?  All in all I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging Racing Game.  9/10: Top of its Genre"
One of the best racing games this year.
This game is awesome. It's got decent graphics and online mode is good too. You'll have to be a good driver though in order to batlle it out with the pros in multiplayer.
Online mode is dead. Single player isn't that much fun.
Can't recommend this game. It force closes after a few minutes of gameplay
This Game sucks
♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ game for online
"Ohh yeah.. When I am bored, I am starting this game and the fun starts!"
"Graphics are good.  That's pretty much my only positive.  Sadly, I have racing games that are more sim orientated as well as racing games that are more arcade orientated, so for me there was no need for GRID2.  It doesn't have the nostalgia factor of old NFS titles (Most Wanted, Underground) although it does suffer (badly) from horrendous narrations telling me to drive faster, or drift...driftier. There are annoying cutscenes as well. Ugh.  Far and away the most annoying thing was the incessant screen resolution errors - it kept resizing the game as a box in the middle of my screen - this has been a bane of a lot of games in my library: if it gives me customization issues, I'll close it and jump to the next most similar game. There are very very few games nowadays that are worth the time to try and fix little issues and niggles.  I'm not saying you won't enjoy it, but I found it not worth my time. I might come back to it and it'll work better. I might let it just hover in my library.  I don't like it, I don't hate it. I probably won't talk about it again after I post this review - it's like reviewing the Lightly Salted crisp flavour."
This game is awesome. It's got decent graphics and online mode is good too. You'll have to be a good driver though in order to batlle it out with the pros in multiplayer.

"Good game, but multiplayer has some serious flaws.  1: Noobs are at a disadvantage from the off, the vets have faster, tuned cars, so you have little chance to win. 2: If you cut a corner, your car gets slowed down for 3 seconds. The system is flawed, other players can push you off track, you receive the penalty and you did nothing wrong. Oversteer or understeer on the cars can also cause you to go off track, you get penalty, your race is ruined. Others players use you car as their brake, pushing you off the track, you get the penalty 3: Grid, the grid is flawed, if you get pole, you're in with a chance of winning, unless your car isnt as fast as the others then you're not in with a chance. if you're at the back or in the middle, it is highly likely you car will be smashed up into the first few corners by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags who cant drive.  Other than thosethings and a few others like the various dlc, then it's a good game. I didn't buy it, so those things aren't as annoying as they would be."
"Cool game, nice car models and the sounds of the engines are great, sometimes the AI is just plain stupid so they ram you offroad for no reason, if you want to play some arcade game with cars this is game for you. There is one problem with my game, if i don't play it in windowed mode it is just lo laggy."
The only racing game were doing a pit maneveuer causes YOU to spin off and crash. The AI in this game does not exist in the same realm of physics as you do. Also side note: the game costs $29.99 yet all the DLC costs $34.99 what a sham!!
"Awesome graphics with low system requirements, great menu presentation and brand new online interaction using the Racenet. Recommended for GRID 1 players and all the racing lovers!"
"I purchased this game when it first released because I am (was) a huge fan of the original GRID and of CodeMasters in general. This game is, without a doubt, a disgrace to the GRID franchise.  You're forced to endure a stupid storyline that focuses on social media and getting popular. The handling is absolutely awful. It is about as far from a sim as you can possibly get. I should not be able to race entire tracks and full throttle and drifting should not be as easy as it is with EVERY car in this game.  Pros: + Good Graphics  Cons: + Terrible Social Media Gimmicky Junk + Worst vehicle handling I've ever experienced + Damage is unrealistic + Starting in last place in every race means at one difficulty, the game will be easy, but at one step higher, it will be impossible to win."
Pretty unintresting clone of 1st GRID.  Super-slow-animated garage-menu is going to annoy you again and again during the game. Championships looks absolutely identically. Graphics has no change from the times of 1st part.  (In fact I feel like it became worse)  Unfortunately game developers try to make us pay for the same game second time.
"I purchased this game when it first released because I am (was) a huge fan of the original GRID and of CodeMasters in general. This game is, without a doubt, a disgrace to the GRID franchise.  You're forced to endure a stupid storyline that focuses on social media and getting popular. The handling is absolutely awful. It is about as far from a sim as you can possibly get. I should not be able to race entire tracks and full throttle and drifting should not be as easy as it is with EVERY car in this game.  Pros: + Good Graphics  Cons: + Terrible Social Media Gimmicky Junk + Worst vehicle handling I've ever experienced + Damage is unrealistic + Starting in last place in every race means at one difficulty, the game will be easy, but at one step higher, it will be impossible to win."

"GRID2 is the worst race game I've ever played, hard to believe its from the same developer as DiRT, although each iteration of dirt has got worst, wish I had stopped at dirt 2 but got and played dirt 3 as little as Grid 2.   GRID 2 is just mindless street racing, with random lobbies in multyplayer your up against anyone from lvl 1 to lvl99, the only balancing to the game is that the lowest level player starts at the front, this only makes things worse as everyone else who is behind you has a faster car, one the race starts someone steers you into the wall then someone else smashes into your car spinning you round by the time you know which way your facing 2 -3 more cars smash you back into the wall, its like being inside a football rather than a car. Once everyone has passed and your moving again everyone else is out of sight, so you carry on in your crappy level 1 car possibly catching up to a few others but the leader is always gaining more ground &amp; once they pass the finish line starts the 30 second count down, on avverage 50% of players then fail with a DNF as the race stops.   Defiantly not worth the 10 GB of hdd space it wastes.  Racing games I have and highly recommend are, Screamer 2, Xpand Rally, DiRT, NSF Shift, WRC3"
"Very imperssive game! I recommend to buy, so more driver would play :)"
You are going to play some time this game... if is on sale buy it
"I just finished GRID 2. I have to say that I'm a fan of it overall. They went for something different from what fans of GRID were expecting, and the drifty handling took a while to get a hold of. Yet, once I built some skill and realized what the devs were going for - a video-gamey crash and bash beautiful looking racer that takes some skill to master - I really got into it.   I think, most people didn't give GRID 2 a chance. They flipped out when it wasn't exactly what they were expecting. Learning the handling is somewhat frustrating - I understand - but once I did, the game became super fun, and the racing was friggin' white knuckle right to the end. I really enjoyed my time with it, and I expect I'll return to it again sometime. There really isn't anything quite like it."
Yea its a very nice idea to put Mustang as a starting car. Game plays better on the keyboard and gamepad than on wheel. 
"GRID is, for sure, the best game in its genre. Cars are fun to ride, graphics is just good enough not to let you complain, physics don't let you relax and have a beer while riding. But neither of this can be said about GRID 2. Damn, it it pure disappointment! It definitely isn't worth paying 18 bucks for it. Anyway, it is still one of the best racing arcades on the market. To conclude:    If you had fun playing GRID - don't even bother installing GRID 2, have fun playing the original game    If you had never played GRID - wait for sales or promo-actions and get GRID 2  "
"After the 38 Hours i beat every race as 1ST. It is really good game. Not a simulation not an arcade as NFS. It is mix of them. I really like it. You can loose control of car really easy, also other races sometime cause a lot of problems for you sticky competitors never leave you alone. Probably best racing game in Steam."
The perfect balance between simulation and fun. One of the best racing games I've ever played and after trying its multiplayer I can say smoothest online racing that I've experieneced till now.
"Just started playing this after trying Grid Autosport. I hated Autosport with a passion but this game is the complete opposite. This game is so much more fun. No need to worry about a stupid teamate, dumb AI, and/or qualifying for races. Just straight up fun racing from the start.   Best game in the Grid franchise."
"A very nice racing game which is currently overpriced. I enjoyed playing it a lot, multiplayer is the best part of it obviously Must have for a racing lover 10/10"
"No, just... no.  i absolutely loved Grid, but Grid 2 disappointed me more than i expected. Not wasting anyone's time: Graphics are horrible Soundtrack is horrible It lost it's atmosphere and it's not addictive anymore It's boring Controls sucks ball It's full of cinematic ♥♥♥♥ that looks horrible. What is this, Battlefield 4?  Get the first Grid instead..."
MORE CRASHES THAN A NASCAR RODEO
"Great game, although not all cars are good at handling (infact some are really crap), last levels of the game is stupidly hard to finish, but still great.  More info at:  http://KSalue.com    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSjk7dAduBw "
"Having completed GRID 100%, i just had to get this new edition. Have to say Codemasters have this game to a T. There is nothing out there i can compare this game to other than its predecessor. GRID2 has been improved in a lot of ways and all positive too. If you are seeking a Racing Game with all ranges of cars from classic to modern, high detailed graphics, and epic sound, then this is a must purchase. You won't be disappointed.   The is a game you can have a quick race, or you can get right into the thick of managing your sponsors, car graphics and team. Multiplayer is good, but only prefer split screen with my kids, and its great fun too.  Just awesome!"
The best location in GRID 2? Portal to the GRID.
"I dont know if Grid 2 is a good racing sim, as I'm not a sim player. But I do have fun playing it, hope that helps."
The best racing game. I can honestly recommend to try it out.
"Great controls, amazing graphics, awesome sound and incredibly fun gameplay - vast improvement over the original GRID. Highly recommended."
Absolute lowest common denominator garbage. The races are scripted. That means nothing else matters - this isn't a racing game. The AI cars race on pre-determined paths and the races are basically determined in advance. It's all smoke and mirrors. The first DiRT game was fantastic. I guess there is more money to be made peddling the illusion of races. This game isn't worth more than $5.
"If you were expecting a an arcade/simulation hybrid or a semi-pro simulation... THIS ISNT IT. it is very arcade'y. After playing GTR2, shift2, iracing, hell even the first grid... GRID 2 was wayyyy to easy. as a sim fan i was driving passively thinking about what coffee i should brew once the race was over unlike a proper sim where you actually sweat and dare not lose focus!  oh and i almost forgot... NO COCKPIT VIEW!.... LIKE WHAT!!!!????... SERIOUSLY!!!.... WHAAAAATTTT!!????  visuals are beautiful though. and if you like some fun arcade racing... go for it."
"Good arcade fun. Sure, not a simulator, yet fun with friends in online, and amusing in singleplayer. Only if the game was free, not only for the weekend. The fun lies in it's castualtiness, it is simple, but if you want to play simulator go and find one.  I'd say 9/10"
"If you like drifting youre better off taking your moms Toyota Corolla to the local Costco parking lot, it'll slide better than the best car in this rubbish game, 1/10 - GRID1 was much better."
"Very dated graphics, looks like need for speed most wanted (from way back in 2005). vehicle handling model is very simple and shallow, and of course very arcade. damage simulation is very primitive and not visually impressive. sound design is adequate, but nothing special. There is nothing very wrong with this game, but nothing right either, except maybe the re-wind function. I also had a few CTDs. This really feels like a yearly refresh to a franchise where the developer is just going through the motions to maintain the quarterly revenue. Oh, and it does not even have mouse support, you have to use keyboard for every menu (no big deal, but come on!)."
"Highly recomend this game if you love racing games! High quality that could rival some of the more known games. Plus, with callsigns, your crewchief can talk to you directly. For me, my crewchief calls me Boss with an italian accent! Perfect!"
"Hi all,  What can I say? THis must be the worst excuse of a sequel I have seen in years. Technically solid with nice graphics and a lot of feel for the car, albeit very simcade-ish. But that is as far as the good goes. The bad: No real gameplay ala GRID. It's more of strung together orgy of races like Dirt or similar. No more raceteam of your own, no more spnsors to win, no more money to earn to buy cars etc etc. Grid 2 is a sub-par game. It is actually an insult to call this Grid at all. It has nothing in common with the original. Codemasters(yea I know the nameis a joke) proves yet again (after the F1 series) how able they are in dumbing down a formerly good concept and ruin the fun. Don't get me wrong, the driving is ok, but if the game around it fails then there is no purpose, no sense of achievement in actual fact there is not much left. 4/10 :("
Rather bad casual racer.  There is nothing simulated or realistic. Cars slide on tracks around corners either sideways or not - does not really matter. Pretty graphics. Irritating cutscenes you can't even skip.  Save your money for something else. 
"-no cockpit camera +the car was very nice -although wsr is world series renault ,but it was world series racing .so, change that tournament name -need more sponsor"
"This game is surprisingly enjoyable, and it's pretty addictive if I say so myself! More arcade style gameplay than a sim, would love for more games to be like this :)"
Anti-corner cutting system and insane difficulty jumps ruined this game for me.  Just buy the first one and you won't be dissapoint.
"With a variety of driving disciplines pulled from all corners of the globe, Grid 2 is an exciting blend of arcade and simulation racing  PROS +Great audio and visual design +Wonderful Multiplayer experience +Numerous game modes +Unique handling for each car  CONS - Boring single player  Overall, This would be my choice for the Racing Game of the Year 2013 ;) "
"GRID 2 is like the best racing experience since NFS: Pro Street for me. The right mix out of action, driving, story and gorgeus cars."
"When I was 11, I bought a racing game called Gran Turismo for my Playstation Portable. Back then I couldn't tell the difference between a pickup truck and a Lamborghini (I'm exaggerating, but when it came to cars, I really did lack knowledge). I didn't have any interest of cars back then, just like every other kid, I liked Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft. Yeah that's right, I'm not afraid to tell the world that I used to like it! But after I bought that game, that one little racing game with over 800 cars, it changed my life, my perspective on how I saw the world around me. In no time, I became a car enthusiast, and switched to PC gaming. But I lost my Gran Turismo... and for 3 years I've never had a legitimate racing game. But then I bought this game. It took me a whole week to decide on buying this game. I had to break everything down, such as seeing the requirements, reading online reviews, and looking at gameplays. At first I thought to myself, 'I should probably save this game for an H1Z1 sale.' But then I thought back to Gran Tursimo days. After that, there was no stopping me from buying it. And then, after 2 hours of waiting for 6 GB to go through, while watching episodes of How I Met Your Mother... I launched it. I clicked on career mode and then I started my first race with the Ford Mustang Match 1. It was an amazing race and brought back so many memories of 11 year old me... Plus I had all the DLC for the game and had a lot of fun. Everything about this game is amazing! The graphics, the physics, the handling of the cars, it's all just so realistic! Despite the fact that this game only has a limited amount of cars everything else is amazing! And it has split-screen mode so if you want to challenge your friend to a race, you can! If you are a car enthusiast, I encourage you to get this game!"
"The #1 Driving Simulator for the PC at present, far beyond the competition, and close behind Forza and Gran Turismo as the greatest Driving Sims ever made.  Accurate cars and tracks, with excellent physics, each car has it's own charecteristics which are lost on a lot of PC driving games.   Sure, it's like every other driving game, however it uses a range of tracks that aren't found in any other game, therefore keeping the game fresh and interesting.  Turn the graphics up to ultra @1440p and then it really shines."
"If this game was a spoon, it would be a good spoon."
I've been wary of Codemasters since they destroyed the Dirt franchise... But I have to say... As a 'pure racer' with little extra fluff (daft challenges that shouldn't appear in racing games) - it excels.. All cars handle brilliantly and the graphics are excellent and the difficulty is pitched just right (only gets REALLY difficult towards the end) Heartily recommended... a return to form!
"I absolutely love Grid 2! The career mode is great, the driving mechanics are spot on. Easily one of the best racing games I've played!"
"Gorgeous visuals, impressive audiodesign and the racing is fun too.  Just don't expect a simulation."
"Great Arcade racing game but not a true sequel to the original GRID in my opinion.. Yes, they've bumped up the Graphics and added more tracks, depth etc.. but it doesn't feel like a true GRID sequel due to the fact it's lacking different race categories. Where are race modes like Touge, Classic Muscle, Formula 3? Can recommend it but don't expect the same magic they've achieved with GRID."
"On 16 August I posted the review that this game was good even that well not anymore codmaster ruinned alot of things, Derby Demoliton Mod is stupid, same map as GRID 1 handlings have changed, It was a fun game wouldn't recommend it now, I have 20 hours playing the more i played i started hating it, I miss old GRID."
awesome fun
Excellent racing game for all styles.  Driiiiiift
Fantastic Game! Great Graphics and is very addicting!
"The best racing game to date, period."
Great
"A must have, amazing game!"
"Gorgeous visuals, impressive audiodesign and the racing is fun too.  Just don't expect a simulation."
"GRID 2?  Hoooly ♥♥♥♥, such an amazing game.  /Realistic/ driving physics, /Gritty and true-to-realism storyline/, And a selection of cars that can /easily/ be purchased.  In total, I give this game the highest ranking available, the IGN holy grail of 10 out of 10."
Nice racing game.
"Too slippery. No matter what car you chose and the road and weather conditions, your car will slide. The handling hardly differs between cars other than the fact that some are heavier than others. I wish they had put more work in realisticly simulating tire traction. There is absolutely no incentive to play the game in story more since you don't earn cash or rack up points towards unlocking cars. I hear there's an actual incentive to play the game online, but the servers are empty and no one's there."
"After playing Grid 1 and Codemasters' F1 games, I had high hopes that Grid 2 would be a worthwhile sports car racing 'simulator.' I was severely disappointed. The graphics are what you'd expect from a game this new, but the driving physics are definitely a step further towards the arcade side, even compared to Grid 1. You can't turn the wheel more than 15 degrees off-center without the back end breaking loose, and don't even think about trail-braking into a corner. If you should have the misfortune to hit something, you're greeted with an insufferable camera angle and some visual effect that make it annoying to try and recover the car.  Additionally, customization options for driver aids and controller settings are nonexistant. If you're looking for a racing game that is at least somewhat realistic, keep looking."
This is GREAT GAME !!!!!!!
"After I played this game for 5 months since lauch in the first day, here's what I got  Good : 1. Graphics Optimization = Graphics is looks good and run great even in low settings and it's laptop friendly. my 3 years old laptop can still run this with Low-Mid settings. 2. Pretty good online mode = It's great and fun to play in my opinion (if it doesn't have the terrible drivers who hit me in the first corner and annoying voice chat.) 3. Variety of cars = a lot of car selection to drive. 4. LiveRoutes system. 5. Soundtracks.  Bad : 1. Cockpit camera view is missing. and this is the huge mistake. 2. Too overpriced DLCs 3. No text chat in online mode. 4. Terrible replay cameras. and it's had the worst replays camera compared to all Codemasters racing games in the past. 5. Career Mode (Can't create the team name, no teammate system, race to earn the 'fans' ?) 6. Le Mans 24 hours event is missing. 7. Drift events is terrible and so boring compared to the first GRID. (and the freestyle drift and full-lap drift mode is missing too. only point-to-point drift.) 8. A.I. in Single Player are too rude especially in Season 5 even you set it on medium difficulty.  GRID 2 is still the fun and enjoyable racing games with the variety of cars, beautiful scenary and mix of challenges. but if compared this to the first Race Driver : GRID, this is the dissappointment sequel because a lot of great feature that in the first game doesn't featured in this sequel.  7/10  (Sorry for my bad english skill and grammar.)"
The best game ))
"One of the best racing games ever! Buy it, play it, love it"
must race must win
Lots of fun but it is not as good as the first one
"First thing everyone needs to know about this game is that it's not a racing simulation game. GRID 2 is an arcade racing game without realistic driving dynamics. This game is for people who like going around corners drifting at 100mph as opposed to people like me who prefer having to actually touch the brakes at some point during a race.   This was even more annoying for me because it looks like codemasters have spent a lot of time and effort creating a stunning game engine with amazing graphics. The handling of the cars just seems to cheapen the game after all this hard work.  Saying that, it's not actually a bad game; you just need to know what you are actually buying. It's a fun game for casual gamers and good value if you get it on sale. It is not worth the usual £30 price though.  Buy it if you like arcade racers. Don't buy it if you don't like arcade racers. Simples."

"I was not a great fan of the original GRID, the music is great, the graphics are still really awesome, but for me, it just wasn't all that fun to drive. GRID 2 looks greater than GRID, sounds awesome and is also pretty fun to drive!"
"Very Very Nice Game... I Played NFS-Series, Dirt-Series.But This Game Is High Class This Game is For Pro Racers... Control System is real racers type.. If You Did Any Mistake..You Lost... So, Don't Listen That Who's Said This Game Is Not Good... This Game Is Best And Like Real Racing World.. Because This Game Has Real Good Graphics System.. ...........I Giving Score To This Game....9/10 World's High Class Professional Racing Game.. Deserved Purely Recommend....YES .......BEST RACING GAME EVER...."
"A step down from GRID. Codemasters continue their pattern of dumbing down their racing games in GRID 2.  If you want an arcade racing game with voiceovers telling you how awesome you are when you win races, a ridiculous storyline and ads being pushed in your face, then this might be the game for you.  The storyline removes almost any choice you have in how you play the game. There's no element of building your garage or team, as you're essentially a hired driver.  In terms of driving, before release the developers boasted about removing assists, such as traction control. This isn't true, strictly speaking. What you have instead, is traction control that's permanently on - perhaps at a slightly lower level than in GRID. This totally undermines the drifting minigame (which was quite good in GRID), which is now 'pull handbrake on corner, and wait for car to auto-correct', essentially.  Certain cars will have the rear step out given the right conditions, but broadly speaking all the cars handle the same. There is a fairly wide selection of cars, but when they're all the same and you have around 20 cars to pick from for a race, there's no point in picking any of them, except the fastest one.  Additionally, there are no interior views on the cars, like in GRID.  The game looks great though. The cars and scenery are well modeled, and there's a very nice lighting system. Some of the new tracks, are also quite nice. Overall however, this is an outright worse game than GRID.  If you like arcade racing, the original GRID is still quite a good game, flaws and all.  If you're looking for a simulator, this certainly isn't the game for you."
GRID 2 is Abysmal. The game is not worth it at any price. It features some of the worse handling of any modern car racing game. Quite simply one to avoid. No Stars!
"Beware: GRID 2 is pretty much exclusively focused on drifting. If you hate that (like me), skip this game.  It has pretty much zero in common with GRID."
" Surprisingly disappointing.   I should start by saying I do plan to continue trying to play this game. I really, really want it to be good, but so far it's been frustrating to no end. The driving physics seem like they could be decent, but all the cars you get in the start are 'Drift' class, where drift apparently means 'Absolutely no road friction.' It's seriously impossible to keep them from sliding. Now, this is bad enoungh on its own, but the A.I. is pretty much completely oblivious to your presence on the track with them, and has no qualms about ramming into you at any speed or position. Not only that, but they don't slide like you do. Ever. So instead of a crash where everyone is screwed up, they drive happily on by while you go careening off into a wall, left at the utter back of the pack. I thought we'd mastered A.I. that tries to avoid collisions in racing games, someone should really let Codemasters know. I should also note that I play with a racing wheel, so I should have the sort of fine control to avoid these things (and can in other games) but apparently that's meaningless here. I don't often ragequit games of any type, but when I do, apparently the game is GRID 2.  TL:DR version:  Good:  -Game looks and runs great -Slick menus and dialog like most other Codemasters racing titles -Wheel support is great, you can feel the weight of the car and the road easily -Decent career mode   Bad  -Game forces you into crappy cars with no grip -A.I. isn't subject to the same forces as you (they have seemingly infinite traction) -A.I. doesn't avoid collisions in the slightest, will run you off the road and laugh -No cockpit view (Seriously? Why?)  I really, really hope I can at least get some cars with traction later into the game, but for them to force you to drive like a madman and then punish you for driving like a madman at the start of the game is stupid. Then again, Codemasters did decide that making an entire game out of the terrible Gymkhana events from DiRT 3 was a good idea... I guess they're going downhill."
"Race Driver: Grid is a beloved modern classic, so everyone had huge expectations for GRID 2. I myself bought it on day one...  Sadly, some basic features are missing in GRID 2: - Cockpit view - Assists options (this is a huge one) - chat in online lobbies   And... The DLCs are overpriced and they further split the now small community (the game is region locked). Codemasters implemented the so called 'TrueFeel Handling System'. The handling is constant drifting on 'ice covered' tracks, because if you keep on the non-existent racing line/not drifting you take the corners slower - ridiculous!   Less cars, less liveries (most are ugly, a thing a 10 year old would put on a car) Small amount of mostly fake tracks which are very narrow, making a regular online race into a crash derby + all that social media / 'fans' thing in the single player campaign... No words.  You are not a racer, you are a teenage pop-star, who is given cars to drift/crash and show off to the crowds. That is what Codemasters went for.  A shallow copy of Race Driver: Grid...  At least they had the decency to leave out 'Race Driver' . Good choice, Codies."
"Multiplayer is FAR too troublesome to participate in. You have to change your download region to UK to find lobbies, then you find its full of latency because of the distance from where you are. DLC selectivly alienates the dwindling population because you have to own all the DLC that the lobby creater owns, and the 3 newest DLCs can't be used in online playlists. Region filtering could have been patched easily, but Codemasters never cared to fix the game.  Single player is fun however. Pretty soon this game will be dead on multiplayer and that will be the only option. Only buy if you don't care about racing online."
"Like most games coming out of Codemasters in the past years it's a bland product. Everything is dumbed down, great features removed leaving you feeling a bit lackluster.  This is a very good looking piece of turd. Shiny and shapely but still have a bad stench around it.  I knew I shouldn't have bought it and yet I did. I promised myself back in 2009 with the horrendous release of Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, promising and advertising game critical functions that wasn't in the released product. Yet I have bought worse and worse versions of F1 and Dirt.  Let codemasters release their crap for kids on consoles but as for delivering a good PC game, thats over and done with.  Also DLC!! Are you for real, most if not all of that ♥♥♥♥ should be in the game from the start. 64Euros worth of DLC for a 40euro game should be punishable under some better business act or something.  Stay away from codemasters and their 100euro products, support 10 indie developers instead!"
Really fun racing game . . .
Amazing ! Recommend to all the race fanatics out there !
"I have only played this game for 3-4 hours, below are my initial thoughts.   Pros: Easy enough, good for casual racing. Full steam support, compare timing with friends. Nice graphics Career mode provides certian sense of purpose.  Cons: Limited selection of cars Certain animation can't be skipped"
I Like This Game...Recommend it to ALL .
"The only thing that turned me away from this game a bit is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 75% of cars in purchasable dlc, and that there is no ♥♥♥♥ view, overall pretty nice game!"
Great game for logitech g27
"Very nice balance with arcade and realistic racing. Beatiful graphics, nice car collection"
"Awesome racing game! You can play with other players in Multyplayer, you have so much nice cars which to tune.  I recommend this game for everyone !"
"Incredible graphics, and insane replay-ability. I would buy this again ten times over. Can't wait for 3"

I don't often ragequit games of any type, but when I do, apparently the game is GRID 2.  TL:DR version:  Good:  -Game looks and runs great -Slick menus and dialog like most other Codemasters racing titles -Wheel support is great, you can feel the weight of the car and the road easily -Decent career mode   Bad  -Game forces you into crappy cars with no grip -A.I. isn't subject to the same forces as you (they have seemingly infinite traction) -A.I. doesn't avoid collisions in the slightest, will run you off the road and laugh -No cockpit view (Seriously? Why?)  I really, really hope I can at least get some cars with traction later into the game, but for them to force you to drive like a madman and then punish you for driving like a madman at the start of the game is stupid. Then again, Codemasters did decide that making an entire game out of the terrible Gymkhana events from DiRT 3 was a good idea... I guess they're going downhill."
"One of the best racing games ever! Buy it, play it, love it"
"Very nice balance with arcade and realistic racing. Beatiful graphics, nice car collection"
"Awesome racing game! You can play with other players in Multyplayer, you have so much nice cars which to tune.  I recommend this game for everyone !"
"Incredible graphics, and insane replay-ability. I would buy this again ten times over. Can't wait for 3"
This is GREAT GAME !!!!!!!
Ridiculous that they want to charge you for extra cars 4 and 5$ for a car or two. Just put the cars in the origional game or just make the game free and charge for the cars not both.
"After playing Grid 1 and Codemasters' F1 games, I had high hopes that Grid 2 would be a worthwhile sports car racing 'simulator.' I was severely disappointed. The graphics are what you'd expect from a game this new, but the driving physics are definitely a step further towards the arcade side, even compared to Grid 1. You can't turn the wheel more than 15 degrees off-center without the back end breaking loose, and don't even think about trail-braking into a corner. If you should have the misfortune to hit something, you're greeted with an insufferable camera angle and some visual effect that make it annoying to try and recover the car.  Additionally, customization options for driver aids and controller settings are nonexistant. If you're looking for a racing game that is at least somewhat realistic, keep looking."
awesome fun
Awesome game ^^ Great controls and feel when reacing with a G27 racing wheel. You can really configuer it to feel very realistic.
"On 16 August I posted the review that this game was good even that well not anymore codmaster ruinned alot of things, Derby Demoliton Mod is stupid, same map as GRID 1 handlings have changed, It was a fun game wouldn't recommend it now, I have 20 hours playing the more i played i started hating it, I miss old GRID."
Fantastic Game! Great Graphics and is very addicting!
"Great game, love it."
"The best racing game to date, period."
Great
Nice racing game.
Meh... Cars or something
ITS FUN..Have great graphics.... but so hardddd :'( my car always end up being a scrunched up paper crossing the finish line last........
"GRID 2?  Hoooly ♥♥♥♥, such an amazing game.  /Realistic/ driving physics, /Gritty and true-to-realism storyline/, And a selection of cars that can /easily/ be purchased.  In total, I give this game the highest ranking available, the IGN holy grail of 10 out of 10."
Just play .
"Best racing game on PC. Love the sound of the cars, beautiful graphic on Ultra details."
"Fun racer that is definitely worth buying, especially if it is on sale.   Pros: -Runs well and looks good  -Flashback system is really helpful for beginners and helps with learning curve  -Some cool international locations in the game -Not too much of an arcade racer, still somewhat challenging  -Lots of different game modes -It is just fun; what else do you need?  Cons: -Can get a bit stale after 15 or 20 hours -DLCs options can be seen as annoying, but didn't really bother me"
I love it !
"Not bad. I got it on sale and Im glad I tried this before buying the newer and more expensive Grid: Autosport. This is more of an arcade style racer than a simulator. When I think racing simulator I instantly think Gran Tourismo or even Assetto Corsa. Its still a great game but the only tweaking you will be doing to your car is placing sponsor decals and other aesthetics.  All in all, its fairly easy to play. Newcomers to driving games can probably master the controls very soon while seasoned racers will be able to come in and start with a bang. One thing I love, is there seem to be a lot of short races. I was (and still am) a Gran Tourismo junkie. But what I always hated about taht game was in order to complete 100% of the game you had to do the extremely long, marathon style races. Some take hours and hours to finish. Im not sure if Grid has any of those but it doesnt seem to be that type of game. GT only has them because it tries to be a true simulator.  Im not crazy about the focus on drifting with every single car/class. While I dont mind drifting, I think drifting capable cars (and those amde jsut for drifting) fall into a different class than all of the other cars available. Matter of fact, drift cars and that style of racing, belongs to a small minority. But in most racing games now, they tend to add drifting into the game no matter tha car or track style. Well, thats not always the best way to drive a track. Also, your car type really matters when it comes to sliding around. In Grid, so far, Ive even been expected to drift an old Dodge Charger in a 'takeover' style race while simultaneously racing against a clock. Well, I may be sliding the rear-end out to get around some turns, but Im not going to be holding a full-on drift. The car is too heavy, tires spin too much, and I wouldnt be able to accelerate out of the turn enough to make up for lost time in the drift. But then here is what makes it an arcade racer and not a simulator...my acceleration and grip coming out the turn (while drifting) was perfectly fine. A real simulator wouldnt allow that to occur.  As an Arcade style racer its great. When properly placed into the category I literally have no complaints. Due to certain graphics and the fact that some of the menu layouts are poor, I would give this an 8/10 in the arcade racer category."
"Fantastic racer, possibly the best on PC. Decent range of tracks and point-point races.  Small multiplayer community limits playability but is decently populated at certain times. 8/10"
"The game is kinda fun,  but the menu controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful! And these stupid tutorial cutscenes, which are unskippable.  So ♥♥♥♥ing annoying!"
"alot of fun, would be better if you have a steering wheel, they keyboard just dosent do it. while drifting at a corner and understeering as soon as you start to straighten out youll get flicked across the road if your not careful, and you can quite easily spin out unless you ease up on the throttel, basically, dont race as fast as you need to and youll be fine lol."
"I Don't Care with negative review , but for me this game has good gameplay and graphic. i preffer to use controller than keyboard , playing singleplayer with hard or medium difficulty is enough for me with full damage on for more challenging.  still better than The Crew,since the game called 'MMO' even the player limit per session just 8 with big map. when beta i can't even play race with other player  so i think for graphic and race atmosphere Grid 2 is good choice for playing"
Two things you need to know before you buy this game: 1) it's not even close to GRID 2) no cockpit view(mods doesn't really count)
"Amazing game with very fun gameplay, makes you want to race even more !"
"This is such a good driving engine in my opinion. Similar to CMR and Dirt 1,2,3. The game has its faults but there is nothing else to beat it yet. The driving just feels right. I just tried playing NFS Shift after 150 hrs of this, and it feels like crap now.  Now I just wish they would design a game campaign like Forza 4 or Gran Turismo 5, but using this graphics\physics engine. Then include tracks like Bathurst, Nurburgring\Nordschleife etc, and all the production and tuner cars like in GT. I think that would sell a million or 3! More accessable than the SimBin series, maybe not as realistic, but a lot more fun."
PROS: + Stunning graphics + Sound effects + Satisfying handling + Variety of modes  CONS: - Lack of cockpit view - Vehicle customization - Soundtrack - Microtransactions  VERDICT: 7/10
"Excellent racer. I do enjoy the style of progression, and the idea of seeing the rise of a new type of motorsport. While painting cars isn't as extensive as Forza, there's still a ton of options. Good amount of cars and tracks."
"Great looking racer with beautiful tracks, especially Paris and Barcelona. Becomes very challenging after finishing season 3 in single player. Picking the right car for a track to have a chance is a science. Fun multiplayer if your not involved in the inevitable mass crash in the first corner of each course and the majority of opponents is not 20 levels above your own :)"
"Superb racing game, tricky to master but you get the hang of the different cars is great. Highly recommended!"
Two things you need to know before you buy this game: 1) it's not even close to GRID 2) no cockpit view(mods doesn't really count)
"Amazing game with very fun gameplay, makes you want to race even more !"
Best car racing game at this moment.
"This is grid 2 what more is there to say, But go racing.. probably one of the finest racing games you will ever play until the next grid game?"
"Physics are ♥♥♥♥, so unrealistic. such a waste of money. The only good thing is the graffics"
wtf!!!! I finish first or second before a lot of drivers... but still when they finish they end before me!!! what the ♥♥♥♥ is this multiplayer error!
"I've played Race Driver: GRID (the first one) for a pretty long time.   Even though GRID 2 is a lot of fun, the mutation into a 100% arcade-racer is kinda sad. Drift-Races with my buddies at the docks without any electronical help and with your cockpit-view won't be possible anymore.   Still like I've said - the game itself is fun and worth any buck - but don't expect a new generation version of the first GRID."
Still the best racing game !
This game is Great!!  Best racing game for PC
"The lack of cockpit view is not missed since this is an arcade racer through and through. What is really great about Grid 2 (sp) is the lack of vehicle modding and customisation. The focus is purely on racing and the lack of upgrades means that you get really tense and challenging races. Graphics are superb and if you have a decent card the game is spectacular in eyefinity and isn't too demanding so you don't need SLI.  I pre-ordered when it first came available on steam. There were a few things that I hated about the meta-game (career sp), for example, the animation that counts your fans after each race was un-skippable. I gave codemasters feedback about aspects that could be improved and they were implemented soon after in a patch! I will always have respect for codemasters and by and large they make some of the most enjoyable racing games available."
"This could be by far one of the best racing games and really is.It is better than any other racing game on Steam.Good sound,realistic driving based most on drifting and the best thing that this game has to offer is an amazing visual experience.Multiplayer is one of the interesting parts of this game too and as a game this one is very stable and very good optimized for PC.A bad thing could be the missing 'Inside of the car' camera view but this thing doesn't matter at all because this is a really good game from almost all points of view...It has a lot of other amazing features to offer...I recommend it."
Why do you force me to drive rubbish americans cars? Whyyyyyy!!!!???
"I think its best to start with the good in reviews.. there isnt many in this game, but I feel I should still try. this game, is by far the weakest one I played, I was sure it was going to be amazing because of the great graphics, awesome cars and even more amazing crash physics, but I always wondered why the physics were not the spotlight when shown in trailers, today I learned why; this game tends to focus on realism more than fun, wanna smash into cars? you might get penilized, what about if you wanna go faster than 90 miles and hour? good luck missing a wheel after you hit a tree  and they must of even realized how bad the game was, because they gave a freaking oops-button, where you reverse time and start from a point of the race where you arent about to die.   I got this in a bundle, and even with that in mind, its still a not really good game, if you get it on sale, it could be a good game to pickup, but otherwise its a flop and not really worth your time, I would urge you to try other MUCH MORE fun things like burnout paradise or race toy cars on the playground, atleast you can feel like your speeding while enjoying it."
Pathetically bad... It is horribly optimized forcing my SLI GPU's up to max temperatures and stutters and lags despite 16gbs of ram and an 8core CPU. The game is laughably bad. It has some cringey youtube superstar plot line and 'driving' feels completely fake and feathery.
"One of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest games I've played so far: 1. super long and dull registration - why would I need to enter all this stuff again - I have all of that on my steam account? 2. online games is unclear - I seemed to have got onto a party, but nothing happened for 3-5 minutes - no notifications, nothing 3. fullscreen mode was disabled after I alt-tabbed once - and no easy way to switch that back.  Uninstalling."
"Absolute dogshit.... for me.  If you like Need for Speed Hot Pursuit (201X whatever) then you'll probably like this. There is incentives to drift, things that will make your post 2000 baby self giggle, Honda NSX is considered a drift car. There is only one car that is 'GRIP' that you can drive that makes the driving tolerable.  The introduction made me want to vomit. They tell you to drift in a RACE, they tell you how many 'cameraphones are on you,' show your video uploaded and 'liked' and then you get an achievemnt after a scout calls you that says 'call me maybe.' This will forever be on my record and it makes me sick.  This is an arcade game for YOUTHS. YOU RUINED THIS FOR ME!!!!!!  Now back to F1 2010 for me.  Oh and were you thinking of just doing a Raceday? You have a Mustand(Drift),Challenger(Drift), randomly and Alpha Romeo(Grip THANK GOD), and a Honda NSX-R(.....drift). Oh you were thinking that NSX-R sounded like fun it's artificially drifty, and it rockets you into walls because it thought you were starting the turn when your tail slides out at the end. (Soft/Hard Drift Lock). However when you look at your cars, you can buy them sold separately DLC :)  Was Codemasters even involved in this game?  ABSOLUTE DOGSHIT."
"So I noticed today that GRID 2 was free on steam for the next two days. I haven't played any racing games in a while, and figured I would give this one a shot. So after waiting for it to download, and the lengthy load time - I see a cut scene of chicago that takes like 3 minutes to run through, until it finally zoomed into the car and then froze. Had to try to CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill the task, which did not work. It still said it was opened and froze everything on that monitor, thankfully I have two monitors. I get my computer to the point I see that everything else I try to open freezes as well and it will not kill the task, so it looks like restarting the system is my only option. Tell my system to restart and the windows restart comes up, and tells me that it needs to force steam (grid) to close. Fine. System restart then locks up as well. Ugh, this is the first game to freeze my system in well over a year. I think to myself, well that was annoying glitch, lets try this again. GOD DAMMIT SAME THING HAPPENS. 20 minutes later, I think I'm just uninstalling this bad boy. Kudos to being the first game to ever lock up my system so horribly though."
Amazing ! Recommend to all the race fanatics out there !
"I have only played this game for 3-4 hours, below are my initial thoughts.   Pros: Easy enough, good for casual racing. Full steam support, compare timing with friends. Nice graphics Career mode provides certian sense of purpose.  Cons: Limited selection of cars Certain animation can't be skipped"
I Like This Game...Recommend it to ALL .
I recommend this game to everybody :)
crashhhhhh bang vrooooooom neeeeeeeeowwww but seriously this is a really fun game and I'd pick it up for around 10/15 quid. Some of the cars handle like soap but I'm good at racing games and found it a welcoming challenge. If you want a racing game that makes you gawp at amazing crashes and stuff and actually give you a challenge then get this. no it's not realistic but then what's the point of driving a honda civic around silverstone to shave .001 seconds off an arbitrary lap time? Is that really fun? No. expect ♥♥♥♥ tons of overpriced DLC too..
"recommend it to everyone, who like cars. realy great game! )"
"The game is a good halfway between simulation and arcade. Visually the game is stunning, the controlls works perfectly and the car damages are pretty well done. The game length is average for a racing game, not too short and not too long. One of the best racing games I've played in a while 8/10"
Decent racer. Little too much of a sim and not enough of an arcade for me.
"Only buy the game for the campaign, plenty of fun, especially in the Overtake mode. The online is terrible though, sometimes you can pass through other players and sometimes you can't which makes no sense and when you actually find someone else making the same mistake as you (going online :( ) you can gaurentee they're going to be as much of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you are in that first corner.   Upgrades are in the game :)....but only in online ¬¬'"
great game
Great game
Nice racing game and amazing graphics!
"Good graphics, really fun."
"This game is stunning. However, gamplay wise the original GRID was WAY better, especially for the 'story mode'. Get the original GRID, its better in my OPINION  Looks: 8/10 Gameplay: 6/10"
"Great visuals, a good soundtrack, amazing damage model. Do I really need to say more? it's a racing game like any other, and it does what it does well. I'll recommend it if you're looking for something to drive in that requires bit more skill than your usual arcade racer. I can't speak of the multiplayer as I haven't played it but the SP is pretty good."
everything already been sad about this game.... I do like it anyways...you can drift in 200 km/h like nothing...just for relax game :)
"Great graphics,effects,races and gameplay"
"GRID 2 is highly recommended for fans of the racing genre. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the Codemasters or NFS series this should be a no brainer.  PROS - - Huge variety in cars, tracks and race types - Graphics - Damage modelling - Paint job customization - Driving model - Rewind feature  CONS - - No race line feature - Car spins during painting - Driving model  If you noticed that I put the driving model as both a pro and a con, it's because really the model is subjective. It is not a 'hardcore' model like you will find in other high end racers. Nor is it too arcady. Like I said, if you enjoy NFS etc, this fits in well with those.  The rewind feature is a huge step forward to reduce frustration in racing games. Ever run the perfect race only to make a small error at the last lap and get dumped to the end of the pack? That's over. Have a crash or take a corner wrong and spin out? Just rewind a few seconds and have another go at it. Feel that's cheating? Don't use it. Personally, I love the option.  Cars look great, tracks look great. Track your best times and stats against your Steam friends. I haven't used the multiplayer much, but its there if that's your thing.   Get bored of racing? Try the demolition derby! You'll have lots of fun with this one."
"Offline mode starts off slow but gets really good. Online game play is incredible and very fast paced, accuracy and guts are required to win as sometimes drifting is the only way round the corner. Five out of five stars, looking forward to a Grid 3 in the future!"
Two things you need to know before you buy this game: 1) it's not even close to GRID 2) no cockpit view(mods doesn't really count)
Amazing game if you deny the fundamental laws of physics
"Amazing game with very fun gameplay, makes you want to race even more !"
There might not be a cockpit view… but darn if this game aint pretty and a ton of fun! It starts in Chicago and on streets I drove a Motorcycle about the same way 30 some years ago… I had no choice but to buy it..;-) Multiple controllers worked fine first time out on the released version I just got.. which I cannot say for some other titles still in beta at this time.. sigh  Night or Day the views look fantastic… Now the damaging effects are something else to be desired. But remember this is an Arcade’ish type game for Fun and it delivers that in spades! Damage is there and looks great.. but if you seen my second run video.. you can pretty much just keep on going no matter what happens.. or rewind.. tons of fun to be had..many cars.. many tracks.. and ofcourse..already DLC..sigh.. 
"I DO recommend this, but DONT go into this thinking its a sim! The handling is very unrealistic, in contrast with the graphics.  The handling model is very far from a sim, unlike the original Race Driver Grid and sequel Grid Autosport, which are both somewhat simlike, but still very accessible.  If you know what you're getting into (ie. an arcade racer), there's nothing to stop you having a great time. Yes, the quickest way round a corner is drifting with the back-end almost overtaking you, which is quite an odd sensation due to the very realistic and beautiful visuals, especially in something like the track oriented Caterham SP/300.R.  "
Best car racing game at this moment.
"This is grid 2 what more is there to say, But go racing.. probably one of the finest racing games you will ever play until the next grid game?"
"Physics are ♥♥♥♥, so unrealistic. such a waste of money. The only good thing is the graffics"
Good times this game is.
"Very fun racing game with good car damage. However, it's less fun than the first GRID but that's my opinion."
Awesome racing game.
Abolutely great graphics from the game
"NO DRIFTING WHAT SO EVER!!! I LOVED GRID 1, it had the best drifting system in any game, but I don't know why the developers totally screwed it up in GRID 2!!! There are drift events, but the way the game is set up, you don't drift, you just POWERSLIDE and that is so STUPID!!!"
"Yea man Im not disapointed after buying this in a sale on steam it looks and plays well.myself a vet at driving games I prefere a driving sim,This has the old school arcade game feel to it +1 Nice game."
"If you're just the average gamer looking for a fun racing game, this is a great option. The physics aren't ultra realistic like racing simulators, but they're better than the basic arcade games like Need for Speed or Burnout. It can be extremely challenging to nail a corner perfect, but the cars are very forgiving if you make mistakes. If you like the DiRT games, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the Grid games too."
"Really nice looking game, nice tracks, and plenty to do, but.. needs cockpit view, and it almost forces drifting, but I'm still having fun with it"
wtf!!!! I finish first or second before a lot of drivers... but still when they finish they end before me!!! what the ♥♥♥♥ is this multiplayer error!
"I've played Race Driver: GRID (the first one) for a pretty long time.   Even though GRID 2 is a lot of fun, the mutation into a 100% arcade-racer is kinda sad.

Still like I've said - the game itself is fun and worth any buck - but don't expect a new generation version of the first GRID."
Still the best racing game !
Grid 2 is an awesome game....I had played the original Grid quite a bit but this one is on a whole nother level!
The Great Game
"not as good as grid 1, but still worth a play"
"Great game, but the first Grid is better. Grid 2 doesn't have all the great tracks the first game had, and the steering is a bit worse. The amount of cars i greater, but they are not better to drive. If you want a racing game like this, buy the first grid."
amazing graphics :D awesome gameplay
"Here are my two cents about this game: great graphics, awesome career mode, good car selection (the great ones you have to buy with real money, sadly) and great audio. In a nutshell: I LOVED IT. Not as good as the first one, but definitely a worth buy."
anyone else getting app already running when you try to start the game? if you had this problem and know how to fix it please contact me
this is the best racing game ever made
Grid 2 is a good to fair (arcade) racer. If it runs on your computer. I got it for 66% off so i can't complain.
This is great!
"Excellent game, awesome graphics good game options and off course very good cars. If you played the 1st GRID, you should have this one, in some points isn't as good as his predecessor but even that, you will be happy and fun playing this one. You have to take care more of your car here, each hit makes some damage to your car and in the end you don't want to drive a car with damage wheels or something like that."
"Probably the best arcade racing game. I repeat it: an arcade racing game! The same 'swimming' controls, even with a steering wheel - that's why I say it's an arcade game. Don't expect a serious real simulation, and you'll like it. Better graphics than Race Driver: GRID, more cars, more tracks. It's still great fun online after so many hours. I recommend it, 9/10!"
"I wanna share my exp about this game. Let me explain it. PROS: + Beautiful environments, great graphics + Awesome Cars + Microphone chatting + Real Control   CONS: - No Story Line  Overall, this game is worth to buy !"
This is great!

"multiplayer friggin sucks, just like all Code Master games. Should of stopped buyin any of them after Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis"
"This game is nice but serious now, why the ♥♥♥♥ I spend around 40€ to buy a game that doesn't handle right with savegames? Almost each day I've got my stats deleted means I've 4 accounts in this game where my stats are gone. I don't blame the game because it's nice, I blame codemasters. 2/10 my assessment."
Would recommend a nice game
"One of the greatest racing game. If you like that kind of games, you should think about try this one. I prefer the money system that we had in the previous game than the fan community system. But it is easier to have new cars."
"Okay uh this is my first negative review and I'm sad it has to be on this one. The game has cool graphics and stuff, but VERY bad physics and it slips a lot, I'm using a steering wheel to play it and it's AWFULLY slippy everywhere. I like drifting but drifting on here it's mad crazy. I've seen other people agree that it's like if you were driving on ice. It also has no cockpit view........ but I think you can fix that with a mod so whatever  but seriously... it's way easier to play with keyboard... I have the game + all the DLC but I wish I could refund it, don't waste your time on this game unless you enjoy pain and suffering"
This is a very good racing game.
"To me this game feels like it's DiRT 3 on pavement, which is exactly what I was hoping for, i'd say around 65% arcade the rest sim, the tracks and cars are awesome. GreenManGaming had this game for prepurchase for $33 with 1 DLC pack and it's worth full price. Again Codemasters EGO engine is perfect, looks gorgeous and it's smooth as butter. Multiplayer is pretty addicting and I like the unlocking system they're using, makes you 'look forward' to more and more stuff. If you want a mix of arcade/sim racing games look into Codemasters titles, good stuff."
"Game is awesome. The looks in this gane are incredible! As my friend would say it, it has crisp graphics. Runs real smooth too! I only get a little big of lag when there's a lot of smoke from burnouts.  Pros: Good graphics A lot of cars Good tracks You can turn speech off! And drift!  Cons: Controls take a little getting used You drift with about every car If you want really really good cars you have to get a dlc thing Dead multiplayer  Sum up: this game is great and is fun with friends. If you like racing games, I would definitely put this in your collection!"
"For me one of worst games ive played... Problems with controller (doesnt recognize controller xbox 360) at all, game freezes every bit, menu worst ever and so hard to manage, whole PC got stuck because of the game errors (multiple times) and hate the backspace button (the recall...it feels stupid)...and the button got stuck (software)... I could barely play it.... So ty but no ty...."
The best game ))
"Oh man, I've had so much fun with this game. Playing with friends or just random people online. The 'story mode' is kinda terrible but online is just great. A lot of cool cars and stuff to do with them. It takes really long to level up tho which is a downside of this game. Anyhow, buy the game, play online, win some races and happy gaming!"
"I know I've only played a tiny portion of the game at just 10 hours, but I am confident I can give it a glowing review right this split second.  It's amazing. Absolutely, truly. A real finisher!  This is coming from someone who has stayed away from racing games for the better portion of the last 25 years. Why? Because I hate 'timers' in games... and what is a race? mostly timers! However this game may have some timers (the checkpoint races I 'just' started are a bit annoying), they are in no way abusive like how 'other' games do timers. So here I am feeling stupid and sheepish for staying away from racing games due to that. ANYHOW...  There is so much variety in this. Different kinds of races and events and locations. So many different kinds of cars, some of which I have quickly found suck (I'm looking at you crystler and mazda)! While some are just so in sync with me that I'm ripping up the events (oh my volkswagon I'm in love)! Its just great.  To top it all off, this game absolutely roars on my system. I have that 144hz monitor, and this game never hitches a single frame off 144fps at max detail. Its absolutely gorgeous and smooth, making it so intense I feel like I'm there!   I began playing in the 3rd person behind the car mode, because I had wanted to see my car and others nearby. But then I switched to hoodcam (where you see the hood), and my effectivity increased insanely... I was drifting tight corners and barely running into anything. It was night and day. Its awesome the game has the choice! Some games force you to their way or the highway, no pun intended.  If you dont already have this game, and even if you are not a racing game fan... I say get this. Its a blast!"
based on my driving ability in game im sure i won't pass my drivers test 
"Astonishingly good game for a small outlay. As far as car games go its great, but don't expect and simulator style physics or options from ricer games. It fits into a small type of game that's out there for racing fans who just want the fun racing and nothing to serious. Also make sure you get the DLCs cos they are great!"
"Love this game, one of my fav racers, enjoyed playing this more then need for speed's.. This game has amazing graphics!"
Fun and have a very good graphics but have very bad things....:  Phisic its horrible... All matches in multiplayer the other player try to f*ck you... If you want to go buy or upgrade a car you need to exit of the party and Online Matchmaking... You cannot sell cars... The Options dont save... You cannot mute X player and if you want to mute all of the players you need to do it after go racing.   But its a 'good' game to play when you dont want to play FPS or War Games. 
The AI resembles someone with cerebral palsy and thats being modest 7/10
"nonstop crash ( i mean the car, not the game). 7/10"
Best racing game for me
"One of the best modern racing games in my opinion. Definitely worth giving a shot. Improved on everything from GRID, except for drifting. They made drifting worse. However, you can pretty much drift with every RWD car on non-drift stages, it's just that the actual drifting stages are hard as ♥♥♥♥ and cars behave completely different.   8.5/10"
I bought the realoaded editions and it is a fair price because with all of the dlcs and the game it is alot more.
"Drifting in a bugatti, That's pretty neat!"
"Grid 2 took out some of the best features. They removed the ability to play as a girl, which, for me is a deal breaker. The cars also feel a lot less, i dunno, right."
"I dont like this game, its to havy the controlls are F*cking annoying. DONT BUY!!!!!!!"
"nonstop crash ( i mean the car, not the game). 7/10"

Amazing game. I perfer Dirt 3 because of the in car view. But this is THE best racing game on steam. I just wish more people played online. :'(

Best racing game for me
- Needs online account creationg - Driving very unrealistic - Bad console port  no thanks
"It a good looking game I give the game that. If you compete in WC, be prepared to to each track several times. Since you compete against tanks with lightning speed. They always hit you so your crash our turn around. If you succede to make them doit, they rubberband after you.  And by the way, the game dont recognize my Steering wheel;) Yeah a good car game should at least do that."
Great racing game with as much customization as a person would want. The consolesque menu system is a bit of a pain but worth the navigation for the overall experience.
Great arcade racer with a rather high amount of game modes. The only downside is the high amount of car dlc.
just fell in love with racing - again - !!! sad that there i no cockpit view but still loving the view SIck drifting engine. works better for me than any other
This is pretty close to the best racing-game I have played in 31 years. The multiplayer with friends is unbelieviably fun.
"In fact, GRID 2 is like Forza Motorsport on PC - the best that we have here right now. There is not much of simulation, limited set of tracks, no cockpit view, but yet the game delivers a feeling of challenge, nice visual experience and many cars to choose from. I've never seen the first GRID, but everything of modern Need For Speed series is way behind this sequel, and I really enjoy playing it."
"Pros:  + Great story + Amazing graphics + Flashback! (You press backspace after a crash and you go back in time so you can avoid the crash)  Cons:  - Nothing  Conclusion:  GRID 2 is a great racing game, especially because it's (almost) rage proof with the Flashback feature. The story is also one of my favorites, you participate in races against other racers and get more fans so you can make WSR (World Series Racing) more famous.  Score: 9/10"
"The successor of Race Driver: GRID is nowhere as good as the first game from the series but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad game. It still has some really good mechanics and absolutely great looking graphics. GRID2 contains a large amount of cars with various characteristics so players with different driving styles should be able to find something for themselves. Difficulty level of the game is pretty much unbalanced because on the same level some of the challenges are way too easy and some may cause serious problems. Unfortunately, there is also a small amount of race tracks and it's easy to get bored when you have to race on the same circuit over and over again. In overall the game is good but not great. Still, it's one of the best racing games you can find on PC and it's worth to give it a shot."
One of the most beautiful racing games I've ever played. I've played nearly all of codemasters racing games through the Collin McRae Rally series to the Dirt series. Online is ok but could be improved. Only thing I dislike is the DLC aspect of the game.
great graphics
"Jumping in to this right on the trail of completing Grid 1 took a little getting used to. This is not the same game as the original, It feels completely different. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, this is a very competent and fun racing game. The handling model is a lot more arcade based to the point where you mostly drift round corners even in grip class cars. This is sometimes fun to just sling your car round a corner but sometimes it can be frustrating with cars often sliding out of contol and straight into a wall. Where this game really shines is the design, this game is visually stunning and the audio for the cars is great. You can take some amazing screenshots of this game on nearly any track. It does still let you down in some bits like having no cockpit cam and the voice over constantly yapping in your ear can get very annoying, thankfully both these problems can be altered with mods. To me this game was just as good as the last and I was surprised to find it as good as I did after hearing countless people tell me it was crap. 8.5/10"
Good Racing Game - Graphics are very good but racing mechanics feel increasingly 'need for speed-ish'. Really wish that a Gran Turismo existed for PC. Something about Drifiting a $800K Bugati Veyron around a corner at 150 MPH doesn't feel realistic. Doing it at 100 MPH in a 20 Year old Nissan 300Z feels even less so.
"By far best racing game i played, and realy good graphics. defianelty recommend to try this out :]"
"Grid 2... is different. If you buy it expecting a similar game to grid 1 or gran turismo you might get disappointed. It's a really fun game, specially if you are into the 'Initial-D' series, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.  Pros: -Beatiful graphics -Drifters paradise, with great physics for that -Great selection of cars -No glitches -Overall just really fun, specially multiplayer  Contras: -Not much of a simulator (if you are expecting that) -A lot of DLCs (almost required if you plan to play online) -No cockpit view or rearside mirror -Story mode is kinda short and not really interesting -Dumb AI  If you still have any doubts about it, here's a video that may make up your mind:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMZZq_I3KRQ "
"Do you know what's great about realistic driving physics and traction?  Well this game doesn't.   FOR EXAMPLE: race a car in a normal race, then drive it in a drift style race. AND VOILA! They are tuned exactly the same. Just loose enough to make it insanely obnoxious in a race, yet too tight to make it feel natural in a drift competition.   why!? That's how it's done in real life, oh, and let alone IN THE ORIGINAL FRACKING GAME!   great graphics, but not even a driver perspective camera. I give this game 1-ply toilet paper/10"

"having a lot of fun with this game, great graphics and the career mode is pretty deep"
"Really awesome arcade racing game! Car customization is really cool! I recommend using a controller or a steering wheel, using the keyboard is kind of strange imo (I use a ps3 controller)"
Nice game

"Before I finished all races in season two, season two finished and season three started. And once a season starts, you can't go back to earlier seasons, so you can't play those unplayed races. And the game didn't give me any warning about it. After this, I got very angry and uninstalled it."
"The game's dynamics are very good and very well refined for all cars of any specifications. It has a story line, which is not typical of a racing game but it is very well done so that as you complete targets and objectives the story continues and you can play the game at your own pace.  If you set it to easy the races still pose a challenge perhaps not from the bots but from the game play its self, the harder difficulties offer a great challenge from the bots and forces you to better your skills.  You have the option to customise your vehicles in any variation of colour with each section of the car (tags, wheels, stripes etc.), however you don't have the option to customise (add/remove) stripes etc, which is a disappointment. Also the game looks amazing with the graphics set to maximum.  If you're looking for a racing game that isn't 100% realistic but will still give you a lot of realism along with some awesomely fine tuned game play I highly recommend buying GRID 2."
"A very entertaining and enjoyable game. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are fun to play. Great variety of cars, but some cars and tracks require you to purchase a DLC pack. Multiplayer is the most fun, and a lobby with you and a couple of friends can lead to some amazing moments and awkward crashes. Controller recommended!  The biggest problem is, you can't depend on random people to play fair. They will crash into you and most probably ruin your day. But if you aren't one to take such incidents seriously, go for it when it's on sale.  Note: Problems with the Logitech G110 keyboard - Sometimes the keyboard locks up whenever you have more than 3 keys pressed. Not like ghosting, but the keboard doesn't respond until plugged in again. So G110 users, stay away."
Totally ♥♥♥♥ing worth it.
Game is not bad as Need for Speed series but not good as Gran Tourismo series (u have no settings on cars). And also after the race replays too bad u can not join even one second 6.5/10 (Grid 1 is better game)
Grid 2 is brilliant. It's hard to master but each vechiles feels unique with handling speed and sound. I have played a lot of racing games but GRID 2 is probably one of the best i have played in a long time
"Made entirely for the energy drink-chugging, short attention-spanned crowd who think that racing is all about simply putting your foot down.  Get Asseto Corsa or rFactor 2 instead of this rubbish."

Possible rename: 'GRID With More Things'.
"As Grid was the greatest racing game of a generation, Codemasters has done it again by taking that greatness and reworked it as a successor from the ground up. Grid is no longer that benchmark. Grid 2 is. THIS is by far, the greatest racing game I've ever played. Pure adrenaline, high-octane action which doesn't let up until you've crossed that finish line. Make no mistake; there is NO rubberbanding from the AI in this game. You wanna win and claim 1st? FIGHT FOR IT, because the AI will work just as hard as you do to be there: Trading paint, slicing corners, braking risky turns and burning off every inch of asphalt on those treacherous straight aways.  Come to think of it, this is more than a racing game. This is an experience. Just as Skyrim has done for RPGs, Grid 2 has done for racers. To oversimplify the fact: this is the Dark Souls equivalent of racing. A challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that will captivate you again and again behind every wheel of every car you take to the pavement.  Incredible sound design, outstanding controls which truly make you feel like you are behind the wheel of every car you drive, and the reactive environments you race in: no two races EVER feel the same and I would be hard pressed to believe anyone who claims otherwise.  If you've never played Grid, now is the time to acclimate yourself to the one and only racer that might just be the only thing truest to the form.  Trust me. This is one HELL of a game!"
"Brilliant. For me, a great blend of arcade and sim racing. Dynamic routes add a fun innovation too."
"Forget the creators' description of this being a hybrid of arcade and simulation. This game is 100% arcade. It's still a great racing game, though there is a learning curve to become a good and clean driver.  Online is fun, but it's not without it's issues. Always be on noob alert, they'll take you out on the first corner. This game is region-locked, meaning you'll only be connected to the server according to your steam download region. It's mostly UK and US players that are still active. You'll need to change your d/l region if you want to reach more players.  Overall, it's fun arcade racing game that's good for casual players. It's best played with a gamepad."

"No cockpit cam, few cars if you dont have any dlc, lots of car/track restrictions, got cancer while playing mp. Huge disappointment.  GRID 1 &gt; GRID 2"
"i dont own this game, why is steam asking for a review?"
ey b0ss... gib me the drift plz
+ good for drifting + easy to learn + online races + arcade gameplay --------------------- - pattern only modify - not enough cars
Possible rename: 'GRID With More Things'.
21/60 :(
This is what I want. So challenging. Awesome ! :)
Atom Ariel 3 is love &lt;3
utill somthing better comes along
"Very fun. If you are a person who likes racing vehicles it is fun. If you expect to customize your car extreamly like Body kits, Dont expect it, you arn't able to modifly your car's body. You have to buy DLC's to get body kits and upgraded vehicles. The only upgrades you can do is: Paint your car, And upgrade your cars engine(Multiplayer Only.) But overall it is very intertaining, its great to play with your friends. Would i recommend it?  Yes."
i love this game 11/10
"Great game,plays well,had alot of fun leveling online,Demolition derby is also a great alternative to just racing, Just wish there was more tracks. "
"After playing many hours of GRID (and also DIRT 3 made by the same company Codemasters) I decided on a whim to purchase GRID 2. I have enjoyed the franchise so far, this second GRID game has a more arcade feel to it, but it's not enough to detract from my experience. For those looking for a complete racing simulator, this isn't for you. But for those looking for a fun, fast-paced racing game, look no further. It's got a wide selection of cars which you can customize the livery and rims on. While the tracks are limitied, it does help you with memorizing them (like real race car drivers do). Overall, it's a fun game to burn up some time."
"Very good game with epic moments, beautiful graphics, destroyable cars and absolutely staggering scenery (especially Pacific coast)."
"If you like racing games that look great and are forgiving of little mistakes, then this is your game. The third person camera angle, beautiful graphics, and great handling on the PC make this game great on the PC. A must buy if it's on sale."
very fun and lots of strat
"First note: this is not a simulation racing game. This is not your average arcade racing game, not to be compared with NFS and other racing franchise. The GRID series is, well, something else. Ridiculously fast (especially tier four cars, they're too damn fast), average steering handling, awesome race tracks, and excellent career mode."
"Awesome game, awesome physics, but always force closes after exactly 15 minutes of gameplay.  8/10"
"I would recommend this game, yes it isn't perfect, but what game is. If you want to buy this game, i suggest you buy it on a sale. All the DLCs are really fun too but also try buy the DLC pack while its on sale to save money. But if your a relaxed gamer and aren't one of those 'full on gamers', this game is mint.  Pros- ~Looks and sounds amazing ~All the DLC packs that can extend your game ~Career length is good ~The AI are good, people say they are on rails but that isnt true as you see them change routes after you roleback (besides the first race) ~Custom Difficulty   Cons- ~Online is terrible and only good if you have a couple friends ~Stupid names/nicknames ~Not many designs for your cars  Yes you get lots of drift but thats fun, if you dont want a game with drift play a game with no cars in it.  "
Great car crashing game
"The best racing games series i have ever played on PC. Have been playing it for a while after i finaly decided to try multyplayer out and got this game on this account. 1. Amazing grapics. 2. Playing on HARD or above difficulty gives u run for your money. 3. Multyplayer is amazing, shame that this game isint as popular as others multyplayer games, (normal for a racing game) . that for getting into the race might take a while (Usualy it takes from 0-3 mins to get room full) 4. And now this game is on sale. So getting this game on sale is definetly worth if u are fan of racing. :)"
"Great game, really nice graphics. Totaly worth the shot. They driving in this game is amazing, it combines the good 'ol Turismo with Flatout in a really dynamic way. Multiplayer is still alive and very fun, since most of the people dont know their microphones are on and sigh every time they lose a turn.   11/10 too many cars."
"Before I finished all races in season two, season two finished and season three started. And once a season starts, you can't go back to earlier seasons, so you can't play those unplayed races. And the game didn't give me any warning about it. After this, I got very angry and uninstalled it."
"Wicked graphics, challenging (can't get way out in front of the pack like many other racing games), able to drive standard or automatic, appeals to both new and conditioned racing players, smooth gameplay, variety of cool cars, did I mention the graphics are awesome?  To all of the negative reviews, stop ♥♥♥♥ing reviewing it based on what you wanted it to be, no, it's not a simulator, so don't give it a negative review because it's not a good simulator!!! This game is a perfect mix of street, track, and drift racing. It's a little arcadey but just enough. Would recommend to anyone with an interest in cars/driving, or anyone who enjoys racing games."
Very Nice Game!
"+Great looking effects +Fun, aggressive racing +Clever career mode   – Needed more circuits – May frustrate sim junkies  8/10"

Best racing game for me
Picked it up through the HumbleBundle and though a bit gri(n)dy it's quite enjoyable. A view more tracks would have been nice.

"Grid 2 is a really good game with a decent career mode, nice graphics and great optimization. Online play is good, this game is region locked though, people who can't seem to find online game lobbies need to change their Steam D/L region. There is no anti-cheat so there are a few cheaters that are in lobbies daily. Other than the cheaters, it is a fun game online. The store page should be edited to reflect the fact there is NO VAC or any type of anti-cheat in Grid 2.  I still give it a 8/10 though. It is a good arade syle racing game, overall."
If u wanted racing-mean real racing no nitrous or something this game is for u... Graphics 10/10 Cars 10/10
"Best Racing Game yet . If you want muscle , go a charger or mustang ; if you want exotic , go koenigsegg or bugatti . Its a game for every type of racer , with the neccessary realism to make it fun !"
"I dont like this game, its to havy the controlls are F*cking annoying. DONT BUY!!!!!!!"
More than race game!
-♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive gameplay    +♥♥♥♥ing beautiful
The first GRID game was a lot of fun but this game takes it on the next level. The single player is in my oppinion not that awesome like the in first game but the multiplayer part is genious. The hilirious graphics combined with a fitting selection of cars and tracks makes this game to a solid 'arcade' racing game.
Amazing game! I played when it was on free trial. I should had bought it on sale :P
"Very versatile game, the online features need to be updated. Pretty good graphics and decent car physics."
"purchased this game the other day now its on sale damn, they should refund me the difference or atleast upgrade me"
Good Racing Game - Graphics are very good but racing mechanics feel increasingly 'need for speed-ish'. Really wish that a Gran Turismo existed for PC. Something about Drifiting a $800K Bugati Veyron around a corner at 150 MPH doesn't feel realistic. Doing it at 100 MPH in a 20 Year old Nissan 300Z feels even less so.

♥♥♥♥in great although u have to squeeze your stick to the north pole if you want to drive like a maniac i have no idea what i'm writing but this review is Great
"Probably my favorite racing game in quite some time. I liked the original, and was pleased to find this didn't dissapoint. My main complaint is they removed the awesome cockpit view from the original. Otherwise it has been a great addition in the series, continuing the emphasis on driving and realistic racing without a focus on whats under the hood, which is a nice change of pace from other more sim-like racers."

Awsome car game for everyone
"This is a 'fun' and good 'driving' game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!  I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t.  In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.  I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games).  There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that.  The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again 'BANG MOTHERF*UCKER', you have crashed again. Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.  I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers. Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER."
"A really good game with a variety of races so that you never see too much of the same. I got the enjoyment of racing in modes i had never even heard of. If you dont mind an arcade style racer, this is your game for sure. One of the best arcade racers, i have ever played in my opinion."
"Fantastic game. Easily my favourite Codemasters game to date. Others will proably have a different opinion but I love the car handling. Sure, its not 100% realistic but its fun and thats the main thing :)  Its awesome having splitscreen to play with friends in real life too.  Definatly worth the price, although I got it for cheap on sale :D"
"Fun game I picked up for 10 Euros, long 'campain', lots of cars. Fancy graphics, good mechanics. The only problem is that you're gonna need a pretty good setup to run it to the max. Them shadows ya' know  8/10"
"This is a 'fun' and good 'driving' game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!  I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t.

"As Grid was the greatest racing game of a generation, Codemasters has done it again by taking that greatness and reworked it as a successor from the ground up. Grid is no longer that benchmark. Grid 2 is. THIS is by far, the greatest racing game I've ever played. Pure adrenaline, high-octane action which doesn't let up until you've crossed that finish line. Make no mistake; there is NO rubberbanding from the AI in this game. You wanna win and claim 1st? FIGHT FOR IT, because the AI will work just as hard as you do to be there: Trading paint, slicing corners, braking risky turns and burning off every inch of asphalt on those treacherous straight aways.  Come to think of it, this is more than a racing game. This is an experience. Just as Skyrim has done for RPGs, Grid 2 has done for racers. To oversimplify the fact: this is the Dark Souls equivalent of racing. A challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that will captivate you again and again behind every wheel of every car you take to the pavement.  Incredible sound design, outstanding controls which truly make you feel like you are behind the wheel of every car you drive, and the reactive environments you race in: no two races EVER feel the same and I would be hard pressed to believe anyone who claims otherwise.  If you've never played Grid, now is the time to acclimate yourself to the one and only racer that might just be the only thing truest to the form.  Trust me. This is one HELL of a game!"
"Brilliant. For me, a great blend of arcade and sim racing. Dynamic routes add a fun innovation too."
"Forget the creators' description of this being a hybrid of arcade and simulation. This game is 100% arcade. It's still a great racing game, though there is a learning curve to become a good and clean driver.  Online is fun, but it's not without it's issues. Always be on noob alert, they'll take you out on the first corner. This game is region-locked, meaning you'll only be connected to the server according to your steam download region. It's mostly UK and US players that are still active. You'll need to change your d/l region if you want to reach more players.  Overall, it's fun arcade racing game that's good for casual players. It's best played with a gamepad."
Worst piece of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played dont waste your money too arcadey worse than Burnout Paradise.
Great car crashing game
"The best racing games series i have ever played on PC. Have been playing it for a while after i finaly decided to try multyplayer out and got this game on this account. 1. Amazing grapics. 2. Playing on HARD or above difficulty gives u run for your money. 3. Multyplayer is amazing, shame that this game isint as popular as others multyplayer games, (normal for a racing game) . that for getting into the race might take a while (Usualy it takes from 0-3 mins to get room full) 4. And now this game is on sale. So getting this game on sale is definetly worth if u are fan of racing. :)"
"Great game, really nice graphics. Totaly worth the shot. They driving in this game is amazing, it combines the good 'ol Turismo with Flatout in a really dynamic way. Multiplayer is still alive and very fun, since most of the people dont know their microphones are on and sigh every time they lose a turn.   11/10 too many cars."
great racer much better on PC than Ps3
"I like racing games like this one, its a awsome game plus you can do multiplayer."
Nice game
great racer much better on PC than Ps3
"By far the greatest racing game yet.  - Excellent Car Physic - Excellent Atmosphere - Nice Graphic - Great Sound ( Engine, Soundtrack, etc. )  -- Most realistic Drift i ever play in my life --"
Great game!
Awesome racing game!
"OK, so let me tell you about the one aspect of GRID 2 that was irritating enough for me to stop playing it for a few weeks, and then when I came back to it, irritating enough, again, to uninstall it for good.  I am well aware that pretty much every racing game uses 'tournament' modes to prolong gameplay hours. That's fine with me.  But GRID 2 takes that concept to a ridiculous level. You have the Touge and Faceoff 'tournaments'. Here's how they work: You need to win a 1-on-1 race. Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK. I will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a 'hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row' brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves.  So yes, I'm thumbing this game down in my review because of this very idea, which in my personal opinion, completely broke the otherwise nearly-perfect arcade racer for me."
One of the worst racing games out there. AI is a huge cheater. When you get far far ahead it will go up to unholy speed to catch up. Also the controls for some reason keep steering left or right.   AVOID
"The best racing game, absolutely amazing mechanics and graphics. Its also very competitive, you can get into multiplayer and play against some real people."
Harder than GRID Autosport
"Amazing physics and graphics, looking forward to Grid 3 maybe."
"The vehicle control dynamics are certainly different from many other racing games. Someone stated in previous comments, that it's a lot like driving around in a snow. And it kind of is, sometimes. One of the main reasons I'm stuck playing this game is that it's challanging. Along with great graphics, good variety of locations and wide vehicle selection."
your controler has been disconected
"As a professional racing driver I got this game due to being injured in a high speed race, which I won. I thought I was going to miss all the excitement of the track being injured, but this game has me drifting and overtaking like a pro again. I highly recommend the game, if you are playing and hear a whoosh sound whizzing past you, thats me...."
Grid 2 executable has stopped working
"Indianapolis was packed with people just to see me test drive a Nissan.  The diving as far as I can tell isn't too special, but is by no means bad. Car customization's pretty good.  Seems like at least half the cars available are DLC.  Still thankful I got this in a bundle.  More info as this review develops, back to you Jim."
I hate this game so much.
"One my favourite racing simulators, that plays and looks amazing via  Windows OS 8  using  DirectX 11   Only really bad part is, it's uses  CodeMasters  own network for all sync/on-line stuff and not  Steam , which is rather slow, but worst of all it only uses  Facebook  rubbish and no  Google+  connectivity, which is awful, but avoidable at least.  The above issues are also found in  F1 Race Stars , which is equally brilliant, but also plagued by the same issues!   *2/3*  - One mark lost for rubbish network usage and very limiting connectivity options"
I have Win8 Pentium 3.5 gighrtz 24 gigs ram Evga Nvidia 670 video card P8 z-77-m pro mo-bo and sound blaster Recon 3d sound card.  I'm getting 96 frames per second average in ULTRA mode. This is the Forza for PC games in racing so far. Dax
"Okay here we go  PC Port:  The PC Port is amazing! There is a reason that in a lot of graphics card benchmarks they use Grid 2, the game is optimized very well on PC. I've had no issues, no crashes, no Games for Windows Live, no issues with menus or anything at all.   Grid 2 is an example of a PC port done right!   The Game:  You start in a little garage with no fans or anything, then you have to get better, gain more fans and then you'll get a better garage! I really enjoy the progression in this game and it had me hooked for hours.  A lot of people complain about how the cars handle compared to Grid 1, in fact almost everyone complains about that. I haven't played Grid 1 but I really like the Grid 2 handling. Obviously the cars dont handle realisticly or anything like that but they're very much fun to drive in.    For its price this game is an amazing PC Racing game! You should defenetly check it out.  "
"It's a nice game, lots of hours of fun. However multiplayer is too annoying with too many crashers which ruins it for me, they should be penalised somehow."
"Just bought on special, wish I had not bothered. I am sure if you stick with it you can get some enjoyment out of it, but for me I if dont gel with the experience fairly rapidly its all over and after half hour fannying about with it, I hate it.  Such as, jumps you right into a race, no chance to check your options for graphics etc, which I find pretty weird to be honest, so I had to wait untl the 'it takes forever' intros and long winded cut scenes at the start of the game/race, none of which I managed to avoid or kill, then wait for the race to start, and then pause the race just to modify options such as resolutions, vsync etc...very crappy...  Controls, supremely crappy, its way way way, way, too slippy out there, and I play Dirt 3 so I dont mind some drifting, but this was just ridiculous, and of course, at this stage (dont know if you can later on) there is no obvious way to modify the vehicle setup so you can at least try to get it to work with the way you like drive in game.  Other stuff that started to annoy me, what a load of long winded blah blah blah from the commentary about how you can youtube your progress and how awesome you are, blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah, no obvious way to stop it in game, I just wanted to say please please just shut up and sod off, an option to just cut past the scene/voiceover by pressing esc or something would be fantastic, but couldnt find one and kept pressing any buttons on my controller and keyboard in the hope could kill the story teller.   Also I didnt do the raceday, which you are offered right after doing the first race, and being told how awesome you are even if you ♥♥♥♥ it up, and despite this, the game still behaved like I had done it, and numbed me yet again with some more background chat and story telling blah blah blah, blah blah blah, for gods sake please please please shut up and go away...  Ooh and of course theres the crashing, and I dont mean into other cars, I mean program, just stops working and you find yourself dumped back out onto your desktop...  Theres just so much i dislike about this experience at the outset that I just dont want to play it again, I could probably get used to all the drifting, but whats the point, I may as well just play a rally style game, and I just cant bear the thought of having to go through all that mind numbing commentary, what an utter waste of cash and an hour of my time...and did I mention it crashes too?   Maybe autosport is better, i dont know, but im not wasting my cash on it to find out.  Some folks obviously get on ok with this game and enjoy it, not for me though...I should have spent the cash on a mighty bucket for one...Ive requested a refund as I just cannot bring myself to try it again..."
  Taylor Swift Lawsuit Simulator 2013 .  Not nearly as good as the first but still fun.
Bought it on a sale Opened game Taking to the tutorial Found out the default accelarating button is the space bar Changed some settings Mac runs game at 30fps on very low Playes game for 1.5 hours Goes to Multiplayer Finds no one Refunds game  :)
"I love this game, It's so fun to play and I never get bored! Can't get enough of Grid 2 at the moment. Try it out"
"Good game to play, support low end PC/Laptops with Onboard Graphics Cards (Intel HD 2000/3500/4000) Gameplay: Physics are... not so real. To get crashed seems to be so easy, you hit AI cars, you are out of the race, also the same with AI, they hit you, you are out of the race, too Graphics: Good to play even i use Onboard Graphic card Multiplayer: Not recommended, since when GRID Autosport released, no one seems to play this game anymore, if you want to play single player only, you can buy this game, but if you want to play multiplayer, you shouldn't buy it ."
"Racing games are a huge past time for me. growing up with ones like gran turismo, forza, wipeout, yadda yadda yadda. Grid 2 is not one i will put on this list. i got it because i ghave been looking for a decent pc racer and damn she sure does look beautiful. BUT, the gameplay and over mechanics and feel behind the car while driving is so incredibly lackluster and poorly engineered it had me yelling at my screen through every turn i took. it seems they spent more time on things like motion blur and unneccesary camera angles instead of what makes a driving game fun....how the $%^&amp;-ing car actually drives. save your money, dont buy it. steam, get forza already!!"
This must be a joke. 24eur discount price for a game which is practically dead is mockery. MP is most of time deserted. DLCs are not likely to revive it.
+multi-monitor support +good crossfire scaling +looks nice  -soundtrack is poor -could use more customization
Better then Need For Speed !
"Grid 2 is certainly one of the best racing games I've played in a long time. The controls feel very fluid and the graphics are great, there's hardly any complaints I could make. Asides from the core components being present, and the game being built very well, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the game that I played. Great racing game, will be buying GRID 3 for sure."
U Driv  U Race U Crash U Cri U Rewind U Crash  U Uninstall  U Cri Mor 10/10
Great racing game!
I Like Ramming People and they say some polish/german/ruski swear words :)
Best racing game ever. Better than GRID Autosport. A game i always return to when i need to race hard! BUY AND DOWNLOAD! :)
"Really good fun came. Easy to pick up for none race type people,"
Not for Need For Speed Peasants
This is the most realistic racing game ever.
Great game.
Great game at a decent price. The tracks do get a bit repetitive and a lot of tracks can only be unlocked with DLCs. Still a great game though and I would recommend it.
"Looks really good, makes fun, no cockpit perspective though. Lots of DLC. Didn't play enough to be able to say any more. "
"No, my screen name was not based off this game. It never was or is. My recent interests in cars and all that further makes my screen name fitting, but that wasn't the original intent.  Grid 2 is decent. It starts off strong. Amazing intro, right into action, with orchestrated and epic soundtrack pulsing as you pound the track in an old Mustang. Your handler can say your first name, out loud, from a list of common names. He says cool things while you're cornering... Heads up on collisions, or remembers that you need to work on sector 3 of the track. The damage effects are bland but get the job done. The graphics are fantastic. The style of the game is awesome. But it gets entirely bland about as fast as the races become.  Grid doesn't know what it wants to be. You get Drift events, Japanese Domestics everyone loves like the Silvia and Fairlady Z.... You get some muscle... You get a slathering of European, German... And then suddenly, karts. Boring ♥♥♥♥ing Formula style cars. I hate the British love of motorsports with a passion. It has no soul. It has 0 anything interesting. It's boring and lame. And little Caterhams are ugly, and boring. Sadly, Grid 2 loves the British take on motorsports... And quickly the awesome Chicago, Miami and Curvey Japanese tracks give way to ugly, bland boring night time race-maps... They offer you a Jaguar, the almighty SLS AMG of course, the most boring and ugly Mclaren, and most European only vehicles by the time you're in Tier 3... But good luck winning any races if you do not pick the stupid karts to race alongside them.   That is a gigantic slap in the face. I like racing to be a test of REAL road cars and what a man or woman can do within a realistic, mostly every-day type vehicle. Track-only specific cars are ugly, boring, and honestly in my opinion an extremely lame lifestyle to pursue if that is your interest. And that's the issue. Grid 2 can't decide whether it wants you in the grounded, fun street race-style cars or in full on boring F1 style races. And in the middle it forces you to put both on the table at the same time, much to frustration and misery as one of the obnoxious AI is 6 seconds ahead of you in his little lame kart because you wanted to break the back-end out on the Jaguar.   +Starts off strong +Fun handling and racing in the first 2 tiers +Great graphics +Epic soundtrack +A great overall presentation   -Turns into F1 style kart racing quickly -Puts Caterham track karts agains full sedans in Tier 3, creating a gigantic rift -Forces you to drive karts to win -Tiniest selection of vehicles, a smattering of some greats, with little to no character -Lush lighting and car visuals give way to the ugliest track renders I've ever seen outside of the Japanese, Chicago and Miami tracks... -Can't decide whether you should drift, or keep it tight, the handling model in the game appears to give up and surprises you on every corner.   In terms of the whole package i'd say the game is a solid 6/10. Great graphics, great racing. The 'car culture' style is nowhere to be found... Sterile and as dull as a doctors office... The game swerves from a great showing to Formula 1 style quick, sapping the fun and life out of the genre while beating laptimes over your head. Blech. "
"Bought it for the online some 2 years ago, ♥♥♥♥ed myself because nobody was playing it anymore. Also the driving feels cheap, slippery and the game's a complete departure from Grid 1 where you actually had to build a team and work for money instead of facebook likes, which is re-tarded. I wipe my @ss in this game. Zero out of five."
Good for collection but not really important   Recommended if you buy this on sale  7/10
"I was pretty disappointed with this one. It gets by as a predictable and safe arcade racer, but that's about the best to be said about it. The graphics and effects are OK. The story mode is less cringey than many of its counterparts, but it still holds your hand a bit more than i care for. The controls feel like a standard, mediocre arcade racer and don't do much to excite. I have a stability issue with the game that i haven't been able to resolve, which is that it crashes without fail about 15 minutes into every play session. Others have this issue as well, but i have yet to be able to resolve it. The game doesn't do enough to get me to keep attempting a fix anyway. Recently, i grabbed this game's predecessor, GRID, and was shocked to find that it is a better game in practically every way. I enjoy it's UI more, it feels better optimized, it doesn't crash, the controls feel much better, the tracks are more fun and exciting, and it's story mode is less intrusive. If you're looking for a solid arcade racer, I would definitely suggest the original GRID over this one. If you enjoy a challenge and have a decent computer, definitely consider a game like Project Cars or Assetto Corsa over this series, as they go on sale frequently and have much more to offer."
"If you enjoyed GRID and think that this is a good successor, dont fool yourself like I did. Money down the drain."
it is pretty boring
"Good game, I get top score and I cry  THE END"
Enjoyed my time playing this game..
Pls idiots who played the game for 1 hour tell me that the game is s**t???? Well its hard when you have played 1 hour and u cant take a corner correctly . You should play about 25-40 hours to finally start playing normally. Yes it has a lot of drift but its not so hard once you start playing.

"Online is dead, no one plays it. The single player mode is worth the money on sale for maybe less than $15. The Single player has a unique system to it, it's actually pretty addicting, I don't even like cars...."
"TrueFeel™, EGO Game Technology Platform, Race Immersion Technology, RaceNet, LiveRoute. That is a lot of technologies in a game. 10/10."
"Yeah, I bought this game on sale. But if I could back in time I won't pucharse it again..  This game costs a lot of money, additionally contains DLC which also cost and it adds NOTHING more than some flimsy cars.  This game is terribly monotonous, but I still enyojed nice graphic. Locations after some time are just getting bored. Commentator is cursedly annoying, but happily I switched him off. Cars are sliding on the street like a cŭnt on ice :V  Multiplayer makes me really angry, maybe because I'm too weak or this is just stupid like hell. New racing games are just shít. Better try to play NFS:Most Wanted."
"Amazing presentation style, along with great visuals.  Doesn't port very well for PC in my opinion. Drift controls are rather hard to master on keyboard for someone that's new to drifting games.  Not so much of a racing game, more of an arcade-styled drifting game."
"The online matches sucks when playing with stupid and lagged people. Otherwise, brilliant racer. The graphics are beautiful and the cars reactions are awesome."
"Months after release, the most active forum thread is one in which the screen keeps flashing black. Seems to mostly affect NVidia GPUs. Unfortunately, it affected me. Steams 'opposite of the customer is always right' no-return policy should come with a 'publishers need to be responsive to bug reports' policy. Codemasters most recent update on the thread is September.  Let the buyer beware. This game, even at sale price, is not worth it.  [Edit: 10 months later (October, 2014), the issue is now pinned to the top of the discussion board, with dozens of possible work-arounds, but no firm solution or answer from the Developers]"
0/10 Would return to the store. Thanks for reminding me to never pre-order games again.
Lot of fun in on-line races! ^^
"Racing enthusiasts, start your engine!"
I flipped 5 cars with my car. 11/10 for the stunt.
"Tried online mode first. You can create an account and start customizing a car. There are no opponents, you can't race against anyone. No sessions to join, creating a session leaves you sitting by yourself in the lobby.  On to career mode:  Handling/controls are terrible. 'Drifting' often results in the car flinging out of control, even at low speeds.  My second career race: Shortly after starting the second lap (of 4) I passed an opponent and then in a turn my right front tire exploded. Due to the horrid camera controls (or lack thereof) I could not see the extent of the damage, only being notified by the lack of being able to turn left and the sparks flying off the ground. When the race ended it turned out that my entire wheel was gone, not just the rubber. When I started the final lap (now in second place) the announcer or whatever finally told me about the missing tire.  Finished in second.  Third career race: things are going well, we're 3 laps in and I've managed to just pass a vehicle into second place. About 10 seconds later I go to take a turn, only to be rammed by the guy I passed. His car stopped about where the impact occurred and he quickly drove away with minor damage. My car spun around fully and stopped in reverse. Got turned around and get rammed again, this time my car went flying into a wall and stopped abruptly. The car that hit me had no ill effects and just kept driving. Now I'm in 7th place. Get going again and I lose control of the vehicle. Slam into wall and car explodes.  Done with this game"
great game
Good simple game but now too many cheaters on line.
"From the people who package you understeer and oversteer, we present you all supercars in Grid 2. Nevertheless I'd reccomend this game IF it is on sale. For the $10 I spent on it I think it was completely worth the money, however I cannot see myself forking over $30 for it. The game is very well put together, I especially like that you actually have to use the brakes unlike in Forza Horizon, however it loses some points from me on the car selection. There are some cars I really would have liked to see in this game that I have not seen yet, such as the Audi R8 and the Lamborghini Gallardo. That being said I did not finish the main game yet, I just started the final season. Another small hit the game will take from me is the test drive because there is only one track you can drive on, it is not a major issue but I would have liked to have seen one or two more tracks. The last thing negative about the game is not the makers fault. The online community seems to be dead, everytime I try to play an online race I wait for a while before the game tells me it could not find any online races. Despite the few drawbacks the game is very fun and recommended."
"One of the best arcade racing games I've ever played. With a gaympad. I don't understand how people play arcade racers with wheels but that's just me.  Despite all its problems/omissions/dlc overload mentioned in other reviews.  But all those dlcs begs the question - where the sexual intercourse is cockpit dlc?!  Edit&gt; Random public multiplayer lobbies very often contain individuals more toxic than Adolf Hitler in April 1945.  So if you're new into multiplayer pc games and don't have enough (e-)friends to play with, be prepared for some really sad, pathetic cheaters and griefers going full-re-turd at any given moment.  Take my positive recommendation with a salt mine."
My graphics were low and it still looked stunning.
If you like dodging other cars while driving then this is the game for you. Because it sure feels like the AI drivers were paid to kill you and make it look like a racing accident.  Otherwise this is an OK and easily approachable arcade racing game. Well at least it has multiplayer.
Its so cool game i have tridit one and i likedit so yeah.
awesome racing game
"Best racing simulation series games out there!  + Superb Graphic + It's Racing Simulator! + You can drift everywhere + Your Car damage decide 75/100 the outcome + Enjoyable MP + Upgradeable Car in MP + Weekly Event (boost your exp and money) + Tier based car  - We can say the MP is 'Dead' now, you need to ask your friend to play in MP - Arcade-ish  = 9.3/10 from me"
You drive cars around tracks.
"One of the best arcade racing games I've ever played. With a gaympad. I don't understand how people play arcade racers with wheels but that's just me.  Despite all its problems/omissions/dlc overload mentioned in other reviews.  But all those dlcs begs the question - where the sexual intercourse is cockpit dlc?!  Edit&gt; Random public multiplayer lobbies very often contain individuals more toxic than Adolf Hitler in April 1945.  So if you're new into multiplayer pc games and don't have enough (e-)friends to play with, be prepared for some really sad, pathetic cheaters and griefers going full-re-turd at any given moment.  Take my positive recommendation with a salt mine."
My graphics were low and it still looked stunning.
If you like dodging other cars while driving then this is the game for you. Because it sure feels like the AI drivers were paid to kill you and make it look like a racing accident.  Otherwise this is an OK and easily approachable arcade racing game. Well at least it has multiplayer.
"This game is really fun and the drifting gameplay really affects on how you race, but its a little easy when the game holds you're hand with the rewinds and a down fact is your car is plastic and the AI is made out of Bedrock."
When will I be able to play this on steamos?
"I found this purchase to be a difficult one as a lot of people bad mouth the game for not being a sim or for not having a cockpit view, Then procede to unfairly dismiss the rest of the game due to their inability to do some research before they purchase a game.  I have found the game to be great fun so far, the presentation is a little over the top, but that is something codemasters have been doing since DIRT 3.  The cars handle well, with a good feel of weight vs. power, powersliding is a lot of fun, the AI is a little plain but it fills it's roll well. Engine sounds are fantastic, ambient noise is somewhat lacking, but the squeal of steel on steel as you trade paint with competitors is good and tire screech is well done.  The graphics are fantastic and optimised well, with some great smoke effects from tires as you push your car through corners, some of the best reflections on cars I have seen.  After reading all the mixed reviews, I waited for a sale on steam and it was definatly worth the $11 on sale, I would have paid the $30 they ask when it's not on sale, if not for so many negative reviews from disgruntled sim fan boys.  If you like car games at all, I recommend you add this to your game list.  I would give this an 89 out of 100.  GREAT FUN."

There is no good racing game is pc  so this game is quite good
"Bad game - in so many levels.  A) It craches. A lot. 6 time in one evening.   B) Terrible control. I have played car games before. Im not expert player, i dont need 'super realistic'. Arcade style is ok. I have bought this game, because many people are like: IIts not realistic, its arcade, its to easy.. I dont know, what is hard for them, but this? With evry small hit, it is like ping-pong ball bouncing all over the screen. Car is sliding on almost every turn. Not playeble.   C) Buggy. There is function to turn back time when you crash. Nice idea. Why not. But. It sometime does wotk, some time does not.   D) Settings. Not enough settings. Like - how strong are arrow key press when turning."
Best racing game i own at this stage
"Get's boring after a while, still fun if you put it on the hardest difficulty. Challenging."
Great game
"While this is a fun game, the final season is impossible to get through because it's too easy to crash."
"If you want a game to play with a weel and pedals, dont buy this game "
Super broken. Could not get passed tutorial before it froze.
"Well, I enjoy cars and racing but this is the first racing game I have ever had the pleasure of owning. In short:  TIL grip cars are better for drifting than drift cars."
"What can I say? Absolutely fine game. Graphics and physics are very good, meaning that the game is very much enjoyable! :)"
Simple and nice...coupled with Xbox controller + ultra graphics = amazing
"it is a really fun game, whit the time becomes repetitive."
"This game is very fun, very nice controlls and look amazing."
"GRID 2 is drift racing game.  + Gameplay feels great + Amazing graphics for 2013 game + Tons of cars to choice from to pleasure your needs + Great sound + Great difficulty scaling + Game is very enjoyable with keyboard too + Split screen + Many modes from races, time attack, drift... + Online multiplayer that works as you would expect + Very well optimized + Has free demo to try b4 buy  - Only few camera options (no inside camera options) - Tracks should be spread into more enviroments to make game more excting  I recommend game to those who enjoy drift racing games, as this is one of the best I've played so far."
Nothing tooo much or realistic gameplay just something fun to play and drift a lot
"If you like racing games, get this game!  8/10  Would race fragile cars again!!"
"Warning notice before you buy: If you care about dlc cars just in single player. Then buy the game only because dlc cars are only for multiplayer. Save up your cash by buying just the game without dlc, however if you don't mind multiplayer only dlc cars. Then go ahead! These cars are great, some better than others but in the end they're great!    P.s even thought, this review gonna be ignored (most likely). I hope that at least one person didn't made the same mistake as i did. :D   Oh, and one more thing: The game itself is great! But dirt 3 is way better in my opinion, however career mode's story is a bit better in grid 2."
"Download,start,drive,drift,crash,retire,ragequit,win,lose,quit the game,delete it,repeat     worth it"

Where are The Physics?!
"Even if you can rewind (which is a pretty awesome evolution of arcadish things)...I need to change dat bumper! Good try, but nope."

Good Game And Good Racer Player
"I sexually Identify as a Racecar.  Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of drifting around corners and running quarter miles in under ten seconds. People say to me that a person being a Racecar is Impossible and I’m ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a shop mechanic install 100-shot of nitrous, adjustable coilovers, and twin scroll turbos on my chassis. From now on I want you guys to call me “Drift King” and respect my right to burn rubber below and shoot flames needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a ricer and need to check your modifying privilege.  Thank you for being so understanding.  "

"I didn't expect a lot from this game as i bought this for £5, surprisingly it is very fun!  People complain about traction and drifting, but it is not easy to drift anyway, it is more realistic in that way.  People complain about cars having to be bought in a DLC, come on, this game is £5 in the sale, what else do you need? A pretty good game to play in my past time, commentary is great aswell!  Yes, the graphics COULD be improved but it runs very well, even on my i3 potato laptop.  I would recommend this game to people who love their racing games and don't expect drifting and traction to be easy!"
"Grid autosport its like a failure,but this game I must admit the gameplay is very enjoyable, Codemaster always make the car easy to control it doesn't like any other developer.But i think there's should be advanced modification like tuning or bodykit that would be great."
"Fanatstic, reccomend to all who like racing games 9/10"
"Key problem with the game... it's damn arcade. This game has nothing to do with racing, hitting the racing line correctly, accelerating but not overreving it at start. Absolutely nothing.  From my point of view any game that includes drifting and gives reward for it, should be avoided in wide wide circle by real race fans.  If you want casual racing, bumper cars so to say... then this is game for you. Younger players will like it as it does not require any skill on easier levels.   I however, I'm deeply disapointed. I don't play games on easy settings, so I go for max difficulty and it's just insane that you can't compete with drifting of AI. This is not racing... I repeat, NOT RACING.  "
GRID 2 is great! even though the way to win is unrelisticly drifting round corners it makes for a really good game as its not as heavy as othe rgames of the genre. the only note i have is that it is very hard to play using a keyboard so i suggest using a wheel.
Great game great visuals and crash damage.
Great multiplayer with amazing cars
"Realistic Game ! You will enjoy every second,you should buyt it :)"
Cool game.I dont like to trevel in the rush-hour.
"Would completely recommend, tons of hours of fun. The graphis are great, and they did a fantastic job making each car diferent from the rest!"

"Typical Codemasters handling and damage physics, not to mention being brilliantly optimised - great fun as a simcade/casual racer."
Awesome Arcade Racing. Lots of different racing on streets around the world. Graphics are good. Works really well with a wireless Microsoft Controller for PC . No need for a stering wheel. 
Great Online Features!
Have you played rehab hero? You get chased by a big dragon but you keep runnin away from it.   I just want a nice simple driving game hows that?  Sssure kid sure.
"It's a good game but if you own the first don't waste money. I bought it because the multiplayer was fun when playing demo. There's nobody online playing it, that is a bummer."
hit leegreves. much fun. 5/5
Best racing i ever played. 
First off I have played Grid 1 on my Playstation 3 and really enjoyed it and i would highly recommend you get that game instead of this one.  This game has beutiful graphics and a remarcable attention to deatail appart from the lack of an inside view which in my opinion that may put some people off. Visuals asisde the gameplay has 'updated' the drifting but i feel they have over done it for me it was a steap learning cuvre that took me ages to figure out this also makes the game feel more of an arcade game rather than a sim.   Personally the only high point of this game were the graphics i also hope that they sort out this drifting feature for the next one (if there is going to be one) i give this game a 6/10  pros   .nice graphics .plenty of cars .interesting game modes   cons  .shoddy drifting mechanic .very repetitive
How did the guys who made DiRT mess this game's driving physichs up?
"This review does not take into account multiplayer, as I did not play multiplayer.  Admittedly, I wasn't much of a fan of GRID 1. But having seen the new race types via YouTube videos, I picked up GRID 2 and the two track packs for about $16USD.  GRID 2 is alright if you're wanting to run some quick, custom races and don't mind drifting around every corner. But the career mode is little more than a trickle of new race types on the same few tracks shoved between infuriatingly long and unskippable cut scenes.  I suppose I got my $16 worth. I'll probably do some single-player custom races from time to time (in order to see the two additional tracks I bought), but career mode is dead to me."
"In a world where need for speed most wanted (the original before some idiot decided to ruin the name) exists GRID 2 just isn't up to par, an annoying voice is forced on to you during the races unless you've made it to the options to turn the voices off, the options menu isn't even accessable from the main menu because ♥♥♥♥ logic, game defaults to a small window with a bunch of terrible graphical settings as defaults that force unwanted blur and such, no soundtrack because they prefer droning d bags talking at you, and slight side on crash can tear camera control from you ruining recovery, there's a needless rewind system (hey if the game handles bad enough that it's a requirement that's a red light) and the small amounts of superficial car customization is ruined by forced sponsor decals all over any half decent paint job you can put together.  If you need a good racing game buy NFS: Most Wanted from 08 I believe it was (the terrible one of the same name was 2012) with it's optional slowtime (mainly used in cop chases), good soundtrack, actual feel of force to the cars, proper customization, open-ish world, and interesting race tracks/events."
"Love it! Environments are so dynamic, crashing is so realistic, almost to the point where I enjoy crashes, because they're so visually beautiful to watch, if you have an 'average' rig, you can still run ultra setting at about 30-40peak. Which is great! Mechanics on driving are so realistic too!  Pros: -Realistic driving mechanics -Car customization. -Great races and AI mechanics are realistic and smart. -Visually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.  Cons: Car customization is limited to rims, patterns, colours, and vinyls. No engine customization, making you just as good as the AI (no bumpers/spoilers) loading screens can be a bit annoying.  OVERALL! Game is great! would recommend to all people who are beginner or ametuer to racing games! or Pro."
I found this game to be quite enjoyable. It reminded me a lot of the first GRID so if you liked that one you will probably love this one. My only problem with the game was that it didn't really improve much from the first one. Sequels are supposed to be a lot more of an improvement and not just the same stuff re boxed with a number attached to the end. Otherwise every company would be like EA.
No first person camera. Terrible.
Game is booring and nothing new

great game
dem graphics yo
"It's a pretty game. But there are a lot of issues for me personally. One of them is the AI - they are, quite literally, on rails. If you perform a PIT maneuver on an AI driver nothing happens, they continue straight on their predetermined line, and you slow down. Another thing that really bugged me were the penalties for cutting corners, sure you could argue I should 'get good' but for me a lot of fun in racing comes from exploiting the grass to my advantage. It's impossible to disable the penalties, even in single player. Having purchased a Driving force GT racing wheel I was disappointed to find out that the game is unplayable with it. I had huge difficuties controlling anything - where as DiRT 3 works very well.  The best way to play this is with a controller. I did enjoy the first few hours a lot though, but in the end I gave up in frustration."
Lack of grids was disapointing
"i don't know and i dont care why this game has so many negative reviews by users. ( Probably their expectations were to high). First of all GRID 2 isn't a simulation game. IF you want that, look elsewhere. If you want a fast paced racing, arcade style game then Grid is an excellent choice. It's fun, thrilling and still has great graphics. PIcked up again recently and played for a few hours and i was blown away. Very cool game !"
Grid 2 is a very good game 
frustrating at most
best driving game out there get it now get to the choppa
No shifter or clutch support for the G27.
Game is quite nice for casual playing

"This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I bought it because I loved drifting in Grid 1. In this game, you can't even properly drift, it's all just powerslides. There's literally no control, you can't maintain a drift. There's no option for changing assists, so you're basically forced to drift with traction control and active stability management and other stuff. -1/10."

Ah Grid 2; where sometimes it's quicker to go round a corner just by slamming into the barriers or doing a massive tire shredding powerslide than using your brakes and hitting the apex. Project Gotham did arcade racing well. This does not.
Great game
Drove into wall at a speed of 190 MPH and did a barrel roll.  10/10 would barrel roll again.

"I managed to complete the game pretty quickly. I liked the progression system that didn't require any money and all the cars were done beautifully. I didn't particularly like the drifiting system compared to the first GRID and drift type cars were a bit difficult to control, however the steering in general was pretty good for a keyboard. Tracks weren't too hard except for one on one races through mountain roads and vehicle challenges on the same roads.. Those were frustraiting at times."

"Don't get me wrong. The game is addictive and if you buy it, you will probably spend a lot of time with it. But there will also be a lot of anger and frustration. I won't mention multiplayer -- find complaints of hacked game servers elsewhere. I consider the Career mode the core part of the game. You haven't played a game untill you have finished the career, right? Now what I hate the most is that the game does not just offer a variety of cars. It  forces  them on you. You find yourself constantly switching from supercars to musclecars to hypercars to kitcars. No way to get used to anything. Also, don't think you'll get fair competition. There's no way to qualify in front. You always start from somewhere towards the back, where AI drivers are more than willing to bump you out of the track and into the railings every time you get near. There's no protection once they get close. Can you repay them in kind? No. They stick like tanks.  Outside the track there's also little to look at. You will win dozens of cars in your career but is there a way do look at them? You can apply intricate colour patterns but there's no way to walk around watch. There's no upgrading until the end of the career. It's all a shame.  If you want to race, buy a real racing game!"

"Decent enough racing game if you have never played Forza or Gran Turismo. They simply took the physics of DIRT and applied it to road cars instead. As you can imagine that doesn't really work too well once you get into supercars. AI is, quite simply, braindead. They do not react to player presence on the track in any way and in the event of any contact the player is screwed. AI vehicles appear to have the defensive abilities of tanks whereas you are sent flying at a mean look. The vehicles all look nice and the environment is kind of pretty but this game is only really worth it if you get it at a steep discount."

What a racing game I have ever played!
i have played grid 2 for a while now and i am really enjoying the game which is why i hope to buy it realitively soon. now there are a lot of dlcs but a lot of reallyy good cars are unlocked within the game like a nissan gtr which is great for people who dont like the dlc cars but hey the option is out there. the game itself is really hard to control on a keyboard so i recommend using a controller to improve the game experience i found this incredibly useful and now i get first and second place nearly on my first try. this game is probably one of the greatest racing games i have played in a long time and i recommend it to any new players of racing games. 
.
This game is orientated around drifting. It is NOT a grip style racing game. Its drift 2 win. If you dont drift you've come last. And dont even try playing with a keyboard. The devs clearly embraced the idea of DLC because 99% of the cars are DLC.
Unplayable. Controlls are jerky as hell and the cars spins out at 60mph when you turn just a bit. Waste of money don't buy this game. Maybe people can play this properly but personally can't for the life of me play it properly.

"Do you want an honest advice from somebody who knows what he is talking about? The advice is the best you can find and it is very effective! If you are running Windows 10, with the latest updates and a high end graphics card as the nVidia 980, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It will mess up your computer so bad, if you don't know about computers, you may have to bring your computer to a computer service center and it may stay there for weeks before you get it back. The reason why it is cheap is, it does not run on latest hardware and operating systems properly, and they still want to sell this thing to you anyway to make the last bit of profit. They don't care if it will work or not on your latest PC. Your PC will crash, and if you have read this feedback and if you still buy this game, the crash will only be your responsibility. Don't be fooled when you see this game under the list of compatible games with Windows 10, of course it will be there.  The game play is over-rated also. To make things look hard, the controls were made non-linear, meaning that there is no ratio between your input and how the dynamics of the car behaves. This only means that it will be difficult to master this game, in other words, you will not have fun playing the game, you will suffer trying to learn what they are trying to teach you how to play."

But the graphics are very good, gameplay is fun, and just overall fun and enjoyable game. I'd recommend buying it if you are a fan of racing games. One thing I do not like is that the DLC's are quite expensive. Yet I do feel as if you're getting your money's worth. I'll admit some of them do cost a lot though. I'd recommend only buying track packs, and maybe a car pack here and there. The tracks that I have are Spa and Bathurst and they are fun road courses. I'm pretty sure the IndyCar Pack has a NASCAR-esque loop track so that may be worth checking out. I have also heard that the Multiplayer isn't very active anymore which is a downer. But in conclusion, this game is so much fun, looks great, plays great, CodeMasters optimizes there games very well. Buy it! Rating: 10/10"
"I'm very like this game, since I start play the racing game, this game can make me feel good, it similar the real life :) If you play, you will like it"
This game is orientated around drifting. It is NOT a grip style racing game. Its drift 2 win. If you dont drift you've come last. And dont even try playing with a keyboard. The devs clearly embraced the idea of DLC because 99% of the cars are DLC.
Unplayable. Controlls are jerky as hell and the cars spins out at 60mph when you turn just a bit. Waste of money don't buy this game. Maybe people can play this properly but personally can't for the life of me play it properly.
"The career mode is good fun once you get a hand of the rather odd handling of the cars. I found using an X-Box style controller felt better and made it a little easier to control the wild steering.  Online is slow going at first, have to level all the way to 27 (out of 99) to unlock all the standard cars, which in all honesty is a pain in the ♥♥♥. You can pay to unlock them all early.  The free Demolition Derby DLC is fun, lots of other DLC including cars and tracks (or mixtures of both).  I nearly always manage to join a group of 9-12 players for online races which is fun, although the mix of skill levels often seems unfair, with level 99s flying past level 8s or whatever.  A few annoying control features - no PTT for voice, no global mute for voice. No text chat, which would be a handy extra feature for the lobby. Menus feel a bit slow and often like there are too many button presses to get around.  All in, I've enjoyed the game so far (compelted career) and I'd give it a 7/10."
"This is the best racing game you can buy at the moment, the games just fantastic."

Its ok for a cheap game!
Great racing game. Graphics in this game are one of the best I've seen in a racing game.
Best acing game for PC ever.
logitech g27 is to much like hard work as it dosnt work on most steam games. sort it out guys its crap. 
One of the best racing game out there. Get it
Too weird. The controls were awful and the game didn't give me the good driving feeling.
"This game is not all about racing, sadly. It's also about gaining fans in fake social networks within the game. As you win more and more races, you gain more fans.  I find that this whole 'let's get our popularity up' game gets in the way of the racing game. You even get videos about how many fans you gained post-race... after each and every single race. The sponsor deals are all about gaining fans, too.  The game makes a nice attempt at immersion by giving you a garage. In said garage you can go browse your in-game computer to see which races to go on next, you can paint your rides and stuff. All of this browsing is done through the most uncomfortable menus ever, since they were made for consoles. So yeah, no mouse pointer, no way of picking the last choice without browsing through them all and so on.  GRID 2 also forces you to wait through shiny animations in the menus and in between actions. For example if I know I'm looking for the third option in a menu, I can't click the down arrow three times for it to be selected until it has finished popping up said menu. I feel tied of hands.  But to top it off, this game is a DLC fest. You choose a car category and half the cars are locked out because they're DLC cars. That's the most horrible thing they could have done.  The racing itself is flawfree though. It's up to you if you wanna endure the popularity contest stuff and the clunky menus and all the crap for the sake of it."

I love this game :D
"Was fun, when i was stoned. Then once thats worn off its just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Codemasters clone of another older Codemasters game. Its so fake it hurts, and only a few cars like in the original and next Grid win over any other car so races become pointless.   Should have called it Drift 2."
"It's a pretty game. But there are a lot of issues for me personally. One of them is the AI - they are, quite literally, on rails. If you perform a PIT maneuver on an AI driver nothing happens, they continue straight on their predetermined line, and you slow down. Another thing that really bugged me were the penalties for cutting corners, sure you could argue I should 'get good' but for me a lot of fun in racing comes from exploiting the grass to my advantage. It's impossible to disable the penalties, even in single player. Having purchased a Driving force GT racing wheel I was disappointed to find out that the game is unplayable with it. I had huge difficuties controlling anything - where as DiRT 3 works very well.  The best way to play this is with a controller. I did enjoy the first few hours a lot though, but in the end I gave up in frustration."
"better then need for speed, for me."

I love this game! I like the physics much more than in Grid Autosport.
Even better than GRID 11/15
very good racing
"This review does not take into account multiplayer, as I did not play multiplayer.  Admittedly, I wasn't much of a fan of GRID 1. But having seen the new race types via YouTube videos, I picked up GRID 2 and the two track packs for about $16USD.  GRID 2 is alright if you're wanting to run some quick, custom races and don't mind drifting around every corner. But the career mode is little more than a trickle of new race types on the same few tracks shoved between infuriatingly long and unskippable cut scenes.  I suppose I got my $16 worth. I'll probably do some single-player custom races from time to time (in order to see the two additional tracks I bought), but career mode is dead to me."
"In a world where need for speed most wanted (the original before some idiot decided to ruin the name) exists GRID 2 just isn't up to par, an annoying voice is forced on to you during the races unless you've made it to the options to turn the voices off, the options menu isn't even accessable from the main menu because ♥♥♥♥ logic, game defaults to a small window with a bunch of terrible graphical settings as defaults that force unwanted blur and such, no soundtrack because they prefer droning d bags talking at you, and slight side on crash can tear camera control from you ruining recovery, there's a needless rewind system (hey if the game handles bad enough that it's a requirement that's a red light) and the small amounts of superficial car customization is ruined by forced sponsor decals all over any half decent paint job you can put together.  If you need a good racing game buy NFS: Most Wanted from 08 I believe it was (the terrible one of the same name was 2012) with it's optional slowtime (mainly used in cop chases), good soundtrack, actual feel of force to the cars, proper customization, open-ish world, and interesting race tracks/events."
"GRID 1 was better, but this has more customization options for cars. I'm torn between the two."
"Amazingly HYPER Realistic Racing Game.  This is a MUST HAVE For any True Racing Fans, Test your Jedi Skills here Driving these Beastly Cars.  Non Linear, Sandbox style racing so it is worth every penny.  Multiplayer, Singleplayer Skirmishes, SP Career, Dont wanna pass this racing game up!!!! Get it!"
"Love it! Environments are so dynamic, crashing is so realistic, almost to the point where I enjoy crashes, because they're so visually beautiful to watch, if you have an 'average' rig, you can still run ultra setting at about 30-40peak. Which is great! Mechanics on driving are so realistic too!  Pros: -Realistic driving mechanics -Car customization. -Great races and AI mechanics are realistic and smart. -Visually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.  Cons: Car customization is limited to rims, patterns, colours, and vinyls. No engine customization, making you just as good as the AI (no bumpers/spoilers) loading screens can be a bit annoying.  OVERALL! Game is great! would recommend to all people who are beginner or ametuer to racing games! or Pro."
No first person camera. Terrible.
frustrating at most
best driving game out there get it now get to the choppa
No shifter or clutch support for the G27.
I found this game to be quite enjoyable. It reminded me a lot of the first GRID so if you liked that one you will probably love this one. My only problem with the game was that it didn't really improve much from the first one. Sequels are supposed to be a lot more of an improvement and not just the same stuff re boxed with a number attached to the end. Otherwise every company would be like EA.
This game is basically an extended tech demo for lens flares with a few cars thrown in. The lens flares were so wild and screen-covering that I found the game to be completely unplayable because I couldn't even see where I was supposed to go.
Grabbed this on sale for a great price. Graphics are beautiful. Probably better to play with a controller because otherwise the cars just spin out on corners without careful tapping of keys. Disappointing that car modification is superficial and even then rather limited on career mode.
this game SUCKS...the control SUCKS.the reply SUCKS.the handling of every car SUCK.and they change the whole game to look more loke Need 4 Speed and not stick to the original mapping of the game..  all in all i give this game 2 SUCKS and a F-U  if they atleast stayed with GRID 1 gameplay it would have made it way better
"&gt;Seems like all cars are DLC. &gt;The tracks are boring. &gt;Only encountered one lapped race, it was 2 rounds.  At least I had some fun looking at the eye candy with my three monitors..."
Very nice work. This is my favourite car game. Many thanks. :)
"For all those who want a Forza type game, this is it. You don't get as much cars and the car customization is limited but the game is very fun and the graphics are beautiful."
Its a cool game to play . Im having fun with it &lt;3
"Absolutely-without doubt-THE worst driving game I've EVER played! Many players complain about the lack of grip,and tendency of the cars to spin. Believe them-these issues really are THAT bad!"
I'm not a big fan of racing games but this game is different. It's just amazing.  11/10
"First I'd like to say that you dont need to use the brake in this game at all (look at the achievement, if you dont believe me)  Second this is an arcade racer where the other (AI) racers main job is to bash you around the track, feels like theyre driving solid granite cars compared to your cardboard crumple zone. This is a step backwards compared to Grid and to add to that someone screwed up the controls, why do we need two handbrake buttons? The normal brake button feels as if all the brake bias is set to the rear, it instantly sends you into a drift as soon as you touch the left or right button at the same time. Also unlike Grid you cannot fine tune your controller deadzones or sensitivity. Good thing I bought this at 75% off otherwise I would have been peeved."
"Great game, physics are flawless from what I have played. Goes with controller like a dream."
"Dont be fooled by this game. It isnt a racing sim. This is an arcade racing, theres no real car physics to the game. I mean I dont have to take my foot off the accelorator for a couple tracks. What kind of racing is that? it isnt even fun! 0/10 never play again."
Fun. Gets boing though
Great game！！
very awesome just for race gamers 
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
online is dead....
"Although Grid 2 is a great game on it's own, it does not make up for it's issues and faults (especially the PC version). Not to mention I went through so many problems with the game black screening, and the game constantly crashing (Pretty much gave up at this point). Although I did have it working at one point or another, probably to do with the fact I was using AMD prior to switching back to Nvidia and it was working flawlessly, but since doing some research I've seen people also have the same issues with AMD rigs, including their CPU. I know there's many solutions to these issues, but I really don't feel as if spending the time trying to fix the issues will encourage me to play it as much as the GRID before the 2nd installment.  If you're into the GRID series then I'd easily recommend this game, but with the amount of effort required to get this game working without any hiccups is ridiculous."
"TLDR: 1) yes but pros only 2) Yes skilled 3) Novice (me'ish) NOT REALLY  Below is kinda a rant, but has more details as to why.   I am a casual game (car) driver, ie I have an old X-box controler. While the beginning of this game is fun, I have resorted to loweing the difficulty to easy on my last game.(PS that's the 2nd game in 3 months). And Yet the difficulty didn't seem easier. Drivers were just as aggressive, Car control expectation from the game is Exceptional. (precision with a controller driving a car on a track.. really). Basically, I find the difficulty options to be a joke. I can only imagine what it's like on the hardest diff. And Yet It all started so well. I won all my races, beat all my opponents and then suddenly.... All my learned skill are for naught. I get ahead and get rammed up the ♥♥♥♥ and spin out. Icut a corner whilst the car is out of control and get further penalised by lack of power. I AM NOT A F**King AI or a professional racedriver, like this game wants me to be. I f**kup , take corners at wrong speed, and angles. And yes, I may unintentionally cut corners. Deal with it Easy mode is meant to give a mild challenge. Very Easy mode should almost ensure a win. But I can't see any difference between the medium and the lowest diff. Which sadly may mean I shall have to give this game up for lost.."
this game is intence to play
"Don't listen to Bullet. His points are ridiculous. The game is an 'ARCADE' racer and it does not pretend to be otherwise.  'No interior view'. So what, it's not missed. the bonnet view is good enough. It's not a simulation.   'Lack of game music/theme'. Who cares? I don't play racing games for the music.   'Lack of rear view mirror'. Again it's not a simulation. I don't miss it and the fact is the game gets better performance without it.  'Pure arcade car handling'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.  'Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.  Do you see where I am going with this? As Arcade racers go the damage model is really good. It's not just asthetic, your car's handling changes. You lose speed, pull to the left, slip gears etc WHich forces you to drive correctly and not just bounce of the walls and ram other drivers.  My score. 8.5/10 "
A great game.  10/10 recommended to all.  :D
"This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is still more about drifting than about racing. Things go like this: full throttle - violent brake - throw your car into a very convoluted corner sliding on all four wheels, then again flat out and so on.   There is no cockpit view, there are no real tracks, no car setup and tunning. They could not be bothered with such stuff. Probably because they were to busy making DLC cars and tracks because half of the cars in the game you bought need to be purchased. Yep. TOTAL rip off, avoid like plague untill they drop the price to 10 bucks. Multiplayer is deserted most of the time, and when you do find a game, you cannot join because you need to buy some DLC car or track. I got mine with a CPU but I really feel sorry for those guys who payed 40 bucks for this game. "
"F*ck it, this game is a piece of sh*t. The AI is f*ckin unfair, and doesn't follow the physics. Why does the every game push this idiot drifting???F*ckin boooooring NFS clone!!!!"
Really fun additive game a must buy !
great game
♥♥♥♥♥♥
"I have never been this disappointed in a second title in a series of games. Looking back at how perfect a racing game GRID is, I cannot believe what an absolute dismal game GRID 2 is. I am not sure why the developers took a fully functional game and strip the life out of it. The biggest problem is that they want to make competitive racing games but they removed the option to race on a lag free LAN.   In all honesty, rather spend your money on GRID and give GRID 2 a skip."
"Hello guys, I'm Max Caulfield. Life is strange already finished so i went to race. Enjoy the race with flashback guys!"

"Awesome PC on-road RCG these years! Wait many years finally,GRID 2 release,can't forget the good time when playing the GRID. The GRID 2 is pretty well,but it's not awesome as nowdays console only's RCG,like the GT and Forza series,specially in cars,PC RCG always lack in this part. GRID 2 has various entertainment game mode,remedy the lack part,not like the PC RCG these days made me feel so boring,always the same thing. So I would said the game was awesome 'in PC' these years."
"A brilliant follow-up to GRID. If you are looking for an exciting fast-paced arcade racer, then you'll not get better than this. With stunning visuals and a well formed storyline, yeah, you read right, storyline; GRID 2 delivers on all levels.  Right from the get-go the Tier1 cars are all pretty solid and fun to drive and the races are varied and interesting. Progression through the tiers as you slowly ramp up the World Series Racing is engaging and fun. With some top cars, exciting moments and great battles, you'll remember the races for a while. Especially as you can record them and upload to YouTube from right in the game. ..and that's just the single player! Not even taking into account RaceNet and the world of online competition and rivalries you can setup along with global challenge races, I'm hopeful that it will continue to deliver for quite some time.  A beautiful, fun and exciting arcade racer. A solid 9.5/10 from me"
Great game.  Waiting times are annoying.
Cool singleplayer/multiplayer racing game!  Pros:  Awesome graphics It can run on my potato A lot of cars Multiplayer has no lag Crashes  Cons:  You need to create a  Race.net  account :II  9.9/10

"This game has one thing going for it, the graphics. I tested it with the Legitech G27 Racing wheel and it was crap. This game is clearly made for gamepad og keyboard for pc not stearingwheel, there is NO calibration avalible in the game like in most games that support racing wheels. So if you are going to play this game dont use a wheel go for a controlerpad. (BTW. No matter how bad you drive the guy who speeks in your earpice keeps saying how awesomely good you drive. Whats with that.)  So basically if you are looking for a racing game to use your racing wheel in, this is not the game and especially not while using the G27 wheel."
Spend 5 hours waiting in Lobbies and loading the game all for someone in a car 60x better than yours to run you off the road 2 seconds after the race starts.  0/10
"DRIFT TO WIN YE YE YE YE YE. this is the lamest racing ever, you have to DRIFT with koenigsegg to win, if you try driving like in real life, you will end up last, because drifting is faster than driving properly lol  as soon as i felt that handling, i knew this game is terrible. They ruined the game with this kiddy-arcade handling. only buy if you want to play with Mario Kart style handling, this game is not for real racers."

Olive oil racetracks and ring around the rosey controls. Gud game.
"Grid 2 is very similar to the original grid, but maintains all the problems with the first one and adds quite a few new ones.  Biggest overall issue, car handling. Its very difficult and frustrating to play any driving game where the handling is poor, and this game has some of the worst. Every car snaps loose multiple times every race. Not just breaking a bit loose and having to oversteer to correct, but snapping loose, losing control constantly. Even the front wheel drive cars are constntly oversteering. Many of the cars go from massive understeer to wild oversteer in a second. If you make contact with an AI driver, you will spin. If an AI driver makes contact with you, you will spin. The driving feels unrealistic, unpleasant, and unfair.  Other issues are: Money system replaced with 'youtube fans'. No decision making for car unlocks, you just get it all at a slow pace. Single player story is on a rail and feels like you have no choice over tracks or direction of play. Endurance races are abysmal, short in duration, no map and random turns makes for frustrating gameplay.  Positives: This game is very pretty  "
constant crashes to desktop and no fixes or updates from codemasters in the games lifespan. its a code issue not a hardware issue is all i can find from other users by googling.
DO NOT BUY! GRID 2 IS AN INSULT TO GRID 1!!! GRID 2 = CASUAL GAME / NOOB GAME!
Probably wouldn't be that bad if the frame rate stayed steady but based on forums online this was not made to be ran on an AMD so I wouldn't suggest buying it if that's what you have.
"Ok so I have played this for a little while. The handling has some people in a tiff. The cars handle a lot like a toned down Ridge Racer as you have to drift around corners. So if you hate drifting your gonna be mad at this game. The nice part is its easy to pick up and play as the cars have weight to them so its easy to judge when your gonna spin out of control also it does have a rewind feature.   The more I have played this title the more the cars seem to not make any sense in control and handeling, Some cars labled 4wd handle like a 2wd drift car or worse. The Honda Nsx cannot take corners at 60mph? The cars at the lower end tier are more believable however the higher up you go the less believable the handeling becomes. Strange.  The cars and tracks are very well detailed and really pop with color. So far I am really enjoying it. The plot is a little far fetched but who cares? The driving is nice and the tracks are detailed. So far a 8/10 easily. I have not tried online play yet but its seems like the online community is ver active for this game. I Have just finished this game total time 19hrs. Still a fun game even with the flaws."
"First i bought Poject cars, thinking that it was the kind of game that i was looking for. But i coulndt drive any of the cars becaouse its a 'simulator',,, and its everything slippery like hell. So ive got the refund of the game. After 2 days i found GRID2, and its exacty what i was looking for, funny driving game, nice graphics, good and smooth controls, slip screen, diferent gamemodes. Everything that i was looking for. So, for me 10/10 grid2 5/10project cars =/ !!"
Nice game to spend ur time with ur friend :DD
Great game... whis the need for speed games drive like this one.
101% dead  also can't get controller to work for some reason  buy dirt rally instead if you can handle it
It's a great game to play if you're into racing and drifting.
"Enjoying this game heavily. Only recommend it on sale price, however.  Looks great Feels great Handles well Nice story element  Poor online play Lack of car customization "
Great game!
"OMG THIS GAME, at first i got it mixed up with another game that turnedoutnot to be for my platform and i thought UGH skrew me but then i tried out the game and it was actaulay the best racing gam i have ever played (even though i only had to pick out of asphalt and real racing) ANYWAYS its realy fun and kinda adictive, One they they could improve is that u can sell cars on the comunity market?? and the ONLINE but YEAH :D 9/10"
Amazing! Get the IndyCar pack!
"good environment,realistic car damage,nice graphic    "
nothing ground breaking aboout it but cant go wrong 7/10
Game is worth buying!   1.Has really nice graphics  2.Nice physics  3.Runs high fps on low end pc's even on high graphics  4.It's Fun  5.Buy it! :)
"I had this game for a while now. Playing it when I don't have anything else to play. It started at the back at the back. And slowly worked it way to second. Then at the last corner it drifted past NFS hot pursuit and secured its place as my favorite racing game of all time. A range of options, a variety of events and 55 cars is just a few high points. Just buy this amazing game!!!"
Good fun and great fun with friends :)
"I did buy it in 75% sale and didn't expect much, but holy-moly .. this game is sick! Even this game is not the latest one, the graphic is incredible, gameplay is also very good."
"The game plays great on a MacBook Pro retina 2015 edition, 60+ fps. I love racing games with the element of drifting needed, perfect game for me. However There are problems with the game recognising if the DLCs have been installed properly on the mac."
"OK so firstly - This game is actually rather good. Its got a smaller scale HUD and less functionality from the 1st game but the content surely is not lacking. The WSR Career is very good. I ended up using like 5 of my 500 cars so you will find your favourite car(s).  Most car specs can be used in any race. Take a Drift into Togue? Why Not? Grip into drift - Good luck winning.  Overall the AI is not very stupid adn the Flashback system also corrects any AI mistakes. 5 idiot pile up in france, just flashback and nobody piles up.  I suppose if you bought Grid 1 or Autosport and fancy this game - Its similar to Autosport and 1 but it is also a far cry from both."
"GRID 2 is a great racing game. It has almost anything a racing fan would love in a game.  The gameplay is like a normal racing. You go, you brake, you turn. It certainly doesn't get old as I feel like I must keep playing this game for at least 10 hours (I won't though). Very fast paced and the drifts are so satifing.  The game looks great also. Every car looks great and you can customize your car to your liking. Any damage done to your car is clearly seen and it can make you sad when it tears your car up.  Sound is nice with the sound of engines and pieces of metal when crashing. Soundtrack is good and sets the mode for a fast paced racing game.  Would not be a bad buy at full price.  (Get it for a good deal right now on  Humble Bundle  [www.humblebundle.com] . Ends about 2PM December 8th)"
"I realy liked that game, in some case it even better than Grid:Autosport."
"Bought this on Humble Bundle for $1. I wasnt expecting much but this game is pretty fun. It is somewhere between a arcade type racer and a hardcore sim. I like the cheesy story mode. Most driving games dont really have any, except maybe for a couple of the NFS ones."
cool game
"This game is bloody fantastic. Multiplayer is dead but works really well, I can play with my buds from NZ/AUS with little to no lag while I'm in the states. I highly recommend this game"
Toxic with Danrun &lt;3
Best present I ever recieved! 10/10
"Really great and smooth graphics... It's also kind of cool that there is a bit of a story, which you don't alway gein a racing game. The only bummer is that Codemasters did away with the in car veiw. The sim meets arcade feel that grid 1 had is gone. This is an arcade game like NFS or any other. It's a good game and really fun, but it just lacks the intensity of it's predecessor."
"very accurate racing sim, although not the most accurate. menus are ♥♥♥♥, but its a port- still better than anything forza will have."
"Want a Simulator racing but with a little arcade? Here's your answer. Unless you're a full sim fan, go Grid 1, Assetto Corsa etc. Grid 2 is more towards arcade racing just so you know. Modifying and customizing cars? Just paints, a little bit of vinyl and rims. Nothing like engine etc in campaign. Go online for more fun. Online is basically what we want."
Yet another GRID game.
10 outa 10 chikn little ratings
GREAT GRAPHICS  Beleive me if you have a ♥♥♥♥ pc its good  cuz u dont need really good pc
"A very nice racing game. Well it has stunning tracks,cars and the challenges are all exciting."
10/10
"7 out of 10  Is it fun?: Yes but also hard Are the grahpics good? : Totaly its all HD i love it What do you not like about it? : Not many people play online i can make a lobby sit there for an hour and nothing happens What is you favorite part? : Personaly my favorite plart is the Indy Car DLC because i live in Indiana, the state that has Indy car racing in it. INDY CARS ARE AWESOME!!!!!!"
Exited and uninstalled as soon as I started in a mustang. The thought of that being a race platform is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious.
"Racing in GRID 2 is very fun with a great sensation of speed and control. The customization of cars is much greater than GRID and GRID AS. This game feels much more aracade-like even than the first GRID, if you like games like Forza 4 more than games like Need for Speed Underground &amp; Hot Pursuit then you should avoid this game and buy GRID AS instead. The career is much better than GRID and not tedious like GRID AS.  there are a few bad points:  - no cockpit cam - CANNOT TURN OFF TRACTION CONTROL OR STABILITY CONTROL - as a result, drifting is terrible and I would hesitate to even call it drifting, more like powersliding.  Overall a really fun arcade racer."
"EDITED: If your Windows 10 Computer keeps crashing go to computer keeps crashing GRID in the middle of races to the desktop, go to Search&gt;Services&gt; and then stop Touch Services and Handwriting Panel. It will stop crashing i promise ya  Good game, AI is far too aggressive and commonly rams me from behind forcing me to lose a race but i like it."
amazing to use with steering wheel
"No big change, but the first was the best car game I ever played,"
Different from other games of the same type in a few ways which is a nice change. Definately worth it if it is in a sale! I got my copy for $1.
perfect racing game
"Absolutely wonderful. I'm not even done the game, but having played with cars in Tier 3, I can safely say that this game is an absolute blast especially with friends.  +Fantastic graphics. +Well optimized. (I have it maxed out at 45-55fps without much fluctuation, so it's smooth!) +Lacking rubberband AI. They're just fast and don't really make mistakes. +No more need for a useless teammate! +Nice, arcade style racing. Oversteering never felt so satisfying. +Soundtrack is pretty bumpin'. +Your steering doesn't lock up at high speeds like some OTHER 'racing games'.  +/-A big change from the more simulation oriented GRID 1 +/-Lots of DLC cars. +/- Not too many tracks. Enough to be satisfying, and allow racers to learn the tracks. +/-Crashes are sometimes fun to watch when you screw up.  -The difficulty can be a pain. Again, the AI makes virtually no mistakes. -AI cars are heavy, making it damn near impossible to wreck them for personal gain."
"Drifting 101: Turn right to go left Nascar 101: Go fast, turn left Derby 101: If your car comes back without a scratch, you're doing it wrong."
"-Good Graphics (Cars can broken to the max) -The Scenery is fantastic -Koenigseggessegesegg Agera is the fastest car in here. -Lot of circuit is too narrow, and lot of curved turn, ( can't use the power of engine maximum at any stage) -( i hope there's Le Mans 24 like Grid but there isn't,) -Multiplayer works, i use UK region as Discussion advices -need to drift/slide to win the game, playing casual driving can win but hard. drift prefered."
"This game is pretty fun, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys racing games.  However it is not without it's flaws: - Some of the cars feel like you're driving on ice most of the time, for example the T4 Mercedes that you get when you haven't levelled up enough to buy T4 cars... - When playing online the community seems hell-bent on screwing you over rather than properly racing.  But, overall, a fun racer with good controls and, when you're up against reasonable opponents, you can have some pretty intense races."
Really Good Game
"Bought it for a dollar, its fun. Buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game."
"I did buy it in 75% sale and didn't expect much, but holy-moly .. this game is sick! Even this game is not the latest one, the graphic is incredible, gameplay is also very good."
"The game plays great on a MacBook Pro retina 2015 edition, 60+ fps. I love racing games with the element of drifting needed, perfect game for me. However There are problems with the game recognising if the DLCs have been installed properly on the mac."
"OK so firstly - This game is actually rather good. Its got a smaller scale HUD and less functionality from the 1st game but the content surely is not lacking. The WSR Career is very good. I ended up using like 5 of my 500 cars so you will find your favourite car(s).  Most car specs can be used in any race. Take a Drift into Togue? Why Not? Grip into drift - Good luck winning.  Overall the AI is not very stupid adn the Flashback system also corrects any AI mistakes. 5 idiot pile up in france, just flashback and nobody piles up.  I suppose if you bought Grid 1 or Autosport and fancy this game - Its similar to Autosport and 1 but it is also a far cry from both."

Yet another GRID game.
My personal best arcade race game from Codemasters.
Big downgrade from the first one in my opinion. The only thing i liked more was the graphics. Still is a fun game but ends up feeling like a chore. Go witht he first one over this one.
"Great Game, i have all DLC and its great. I love the racing!"

awesome game. To me its wayy better that Nfs series. Codemasters did a great job on this one.
Amazing game with awesome graphics with great optimization I love it.
"Pretty much the perfect racing game. The controls are very responsive, the tracks are fun and gorgeous, and the cars are sweet, but realistic. Very, very fun, and totally incredible graphics. Sometimes you forget that you're not watching a movie when you play this game."
Awesome racing
I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME!  PROs Easy way to spend a day just having fun Feels good with a controller and a Steering wheel A LOT OF THINGS TO ADD HERE  CONs  Doesnt feel right on the keyboard.. But yeah its a Racing game sooo
"Grid 2 is an arcade racing game developed and published by Codemasters and is a sequel to the populair Race Driver: Grid game. In Grid 2 you race in real world locations and cities such as Miami, Chicago, Paris, Barcelona, Côte d'Azur, Dubai, Japan and many more.  In the singleplayer mode it's all about the World Series Racing (WSR) and you must work your way up by beating racing clans and prestige drivers in career club events, receiving fans and earn faster cars varying from Tier 1 to 4. There are many racetypes such as Time Attack, Elimination, Drift, Checkpoint, Faceoff, Destruction Derby (free dlc) and Race of course. The multiplayer mode behaves almost the same except that you do not earn fans but money per race in order to buy and upgrade your cars. Besides Online Events there are also game modes such as Global Challenge and Rivals for more entertainment. The DLC content packs for GRID2 are also great, giving you more cars and some of them have extra racetracks to challenge your competitors.  Grid 2 is one of my first race games where I feel very comfortable to go online with. Every car feels different and the racetracks are very memorable for me. Although Codemaster left the well known cockpit view from the first game, Grid 2 is still very enjoying and true must have for people who love arcade racing!"
"The perfect balance between Simulation racing and Arcade racing. Also has a very long campaign, beautiful graphics and a nice storyline (although at parts it can get a little repetetive.)"
cool game :D
very nice game
love this game.
Overall its fun to play but if you loved drifting on the original Grid and thats why you want this one.. Don't bother - they've killed it. Otherwise the multiplayer etc is pretty well done. Graphics are good and quick to load.
Good graphics but very disappointing drifts.  8/10
"A Paradise compared to the first, even though I'm not a fan of the 'on track' kind of games, this is really good, graphics are astonishing, gameplay is good, took me a bit to get used to it but it's fine, oh and the DRIFTING... dear God... really nice!  I definitely recommend it."

Super fun awesome racing game!
"Enjoying this game heavily. Only recommend it on sale price, however.  Looks great Feels great Handles well Nice story element  Poor online play Lack of car customization "
Great game!
"OMG THIS GAME, at first i got it mixed up with another game that turnedoutnot to be for my platform and i thought UGH skrew me but then i tried out the game and it was actaulay the best racing gam i have ever played (even though i only had to pick out of asphalt and real racing) ANYWAYS its realy fun and kinda adictive, One they they could improve is that u can sell cars on the comunity market?? and the ONLINE but YEAH :D 9/10"
Amazing! Get the IndyCar pack!
"good environment,realistic car damage,nice graphic    "
nothing ground breaking aboout it but cant go wrong 7/10
Game is worth buying!   1.Has really nice graphics  2.Nice physics  3.Runs high fps on low end pc's even on high graphics  4.It's Fun  5.Buy it! :)
"I had this game for a while now. Playing it when I don't have anything else to play. It started at the back at the back. And slowly worked it way to second. Then at the last corner it drifted past NFS hot pursuit and secured its place as my favorite racing game of all time. A range of options, a variety of events and 55 cars is just a few high points. Just buy this amazing game!!!"
Good fun and great fun with friends :)
"Awesome race game. Real damage physics, much fun, great UI."
"Cool game , lots of cars , too bad there's no one online :'("
This game incorporates a unique and solid drifting mechanic that makes this game very enjoyable.
nice game fun too play it :P GG
"Ok, so I'm not a huge racing game fan. I've never really been into need4speed, gran turismo, project gotham and so on. This probably has a lot to do with a friend who would take great pleasure in showing no mercy to noobs to racing games he'd been playing for months. Getting repeatedly lapped sucked the joy out of most of these games for me. Then I discovered Forza 2, a game that had somehow gone under his radar. And having not lost the will to live whilst playing it I actually got ok at it and played it upto the point when the endurance races begun. Then my friend discovered it and finally here was a racing game that I could beat him at. So the Forza franchise will forever hold a special place in my affections. But sadly Microsoft have not ported any version of Forza to the PC, which sucks.  Step up Grid 2. Grid 2 has a feel of Forza about it. It looks beautiful, with graphics that are comparable to Forza 5. It boasts game play that can be exhillerating and infuriating during the same race. It also includes Brands Hatch and two F1 tracks in Yas Marina in the UAE and the Red Bull Ring in Austria. In short I have been looking for a racing game that I can find as enjoyable as I used to Forza. And although Grid 2 lacks the depth of Forza, I have found it every bit as enjoyable in the few short hours that I have played it, and for me there can be no higher praise for a racing game than that.  8/10 (would be 9/10 if it was Forza)"

Really Good Game
Big downgrade from the first one in my opinion. The only thing i liked more was the graphics. Still is a fun game but ends up feeling like a chore. Go witht he first one over this one.
"Great Game, i have all DLC and its great. I love the racing!"
"Terrible game, AI cheats, car design is a mis-mash, zero attempt to adhere to the realism of many of the cars. AI ignores players and plows into players ad-nauseum. Cars are randomly fat, slow, or drift happy (drift is so unreal it's moronic). Drift design ignores the laws of physics. Drift, tire squeeeeeeeellll.  Lens flare is often blinding, camera shakes absurdly over 120 MPH (why do all the bad racing games have this effect?), most of the races in the campaign are done without a sighting lap, so you'll be at a perpetual disadvantage.   The random levels are stupid, most of the locations are the same one backwards and forwards with such little variety. It's like playing a late 90s racer with new graphics.  0/10 at worst, 5/10 at the best moments. DO NOT BUY."
It's a cool arcade driving game. If you like driving and having a good time get the game
"Wasn't a bad game, I want this myself doe."
"It's got a unique singeplayer campaign, great visuals, intuitive controls and gameplay, and solid physics.   Seriously, what else could you want from a realistic racing game? I'd really recommend it."
overall nice GRID (Great) Racing Game   score 10/10
Get GRID 1 instead.  - Average physics.  - That glitch effect on the screen when you damage your car really ruins inmersion.  - Less than fluent UI.  - Car customization feels like a flash game.
"I never had given up on a racing game before until Grid 2 and that in the first round.  If the developer wants nobody to win, that's fine, don't put the game on Steam then !!! The AI cars cheat like 4uck... I'm about 30 meters from the finish line and the AI car pulls the cheat button and wins the race even the car was miles away from me !  voting it down to be the worst racing game ever   don't waste your money on this game"
"Abysmal.  Rubber-banding AI, nonsensical physics, etc. AI cars will take little to absolutely no damage upon being rammed at 200 mph, but getting tapped by one of them will send you flying the opposite direction into a wall. Features include: unresponsive steering, horribly optimized graphics, very bad corner-cutting detection, etc.  Even at sale price, stay away. I'd rather play Bad Rats."
Gets boring really quick &amp; tbh nobody cares if u max lvl online cos ive seen loads trash max lvl players online easy...Gets boring really quick..would i recommend it.............no unless u wanna Grind on a weekend game.Single player is bllx..Tbh dirt 2 is def the best 1 ..
"I really like this game because it don't requires any good computer specs so it't fun, cheap and intresting to play."
"i love the original.. but I would not of got this if I knew that it didn't have a cockpit view! Especially for widescreen gaming with Nvidia surround such a shame but not everyone has multi monitor setups to use the in car view I guess :( Also what's with all the over the top smoke when you go around corners too, this is not a serious driving game it's more of a silly arcade game more for a bit of a laugh with silly over the top crashing into other cars to win, not really for the serious racers."
I think the best car racing game on PC.!
It's a fun game. Has the best racing game engine I have seen and has good graphics.
"Not sure why, but bought the game and now it wont allow me to redownload again without payibg again. WTH??"
"good game ,good graphic ,really addicting . Love it :)"
The Graphics of this game is Soooo GOOOD!!
"  why buy dlc to open the car, sad froo :["
worth playing ...!! :3
"I love the genere. The game its good but to few tracks, to many cars to bougth with real money. And people have stoped playing online. I wanted so much to love this game. Also it only works on my laptop with nvidia graphics, it doesn't work in my gaming rig, somethig not compatible with amd graphics, go figure"
"The game fails to load its own saves, something that hasn't been fixed by all the 'patches'.  It might work for you, it might not. You decide if you want to bet the game's price and possibly get broken piece of code."
I tried it with a Logitech F710 controller with a lot of different control bindings. It just is too hard even on 'easy'. In a word it is 'FRUSTRATING'. This is more of a racing simulation than a racing game.
"Played the whole singleplayer 100% with my friend, was fun to play. But we got hooked up even more on the multiplayer version of this game. Demolition derby is so much fun, every racing game fan should check out Grid series."
"Simply the best racing game ever made.  Don't forget to trade paint n bumpers with others, that's like a full-time job to me ;)"
"GRID 2 suffers from severe issues in the user interface. It forces you to race a match before it will let you do anything else, such as pick your player name. And the list of names available are all MALE, names like Randy, Jeff, Muhammed and even Jesus... but not a single female name to pick from! Way to alienate half of the population, Codemasters.  In one race I got spun around, and amidst the confusion and smoke I didn't realise I was facing the wrong way. The game didn't tell me that I was going the wrong way, but it did abruptly disqualify me.  It also seems to lock most of the cars away from you, until you've levelled up. If you want to play a Level 1 multiplayer game with anything but an Alfa Romeo, you're sweet outta luck. Try again in about a dozen or so races.  It boggles my mind that a game that feels so fun to play is being choked to death by bad designers."
.
"Really enjoyed this game for what what it's supposed to be, and arcade style driving game with overdone sounds! Honestly most of the cars in this game handle as if on rails, cars that I know do not hanble that well in real life. It's certainly fun but don't expect Forza realism."
Good graphics and an all round great game.Lots of customizable aspects too.
shame on Codemasters
hard to play without steering wheel...
"Slightly older game, but it still manages to holds its own against newer titles. Controls feel good without being *too* silly and arcade-y. Good selection of cars with fairly distinct characteristics to choose from. Pretty nice selection of tracks — the downhill mountain track in Japan is a personal favourite. Excellent casual online racing fun against your friends, especially if you have a good range of cars unlocked. I just wish we could change that stupid 20 second countdown before each race, as I prefer a bit more time to think about my vehicle choice."
"Grid 2 is a gorgeous, well-designed game that packs a tonne of variety into both single-player and multiplayer. Hardcore sim fans and those who refuse to play anything that doesn’t feature a cockpit may well disapprove, but Grid 2‘s realistic-but-not-too-realistic driving and drifting should be able to pull a squeak of delight out of just about anyone else."
"Not worth purchasing this game, just had it for free with my cpu, so boring after you completed the story, driving engine isn't even near realistic."
why is it keeep crashing and restarting?????????
"Good graphics, interesting machines, but a little tuning and a boring story"
  Its ok
"  speed really fast cars, but nice as well."
"Bought at steam sale, nothing to complain about :P"
i crashed into a wall -&gt; +375 fans :D
"Transformed game compared to Grid (1). This is better in every way possible, I could not ne bothered to play the original but in this the UI feels modern. The cars drive well, you can feel/understand the weight transfer even using a game pad. This makes it fun to play. This is worth getting if on special.  UPDATE: As you get further in you are forced to play bumper cars at the start of races to force your way through the pack quickly enough to have a chance to win races. The later levels also have a wild spread of difficulty that ranges from simple to insane and not much between. The hard levels are caused by stupid looooooog tracks with no run off and the need to use cars that handle really badly but really fast. Because of this I lost interest, shame as great fun until that pont  UPDATE: Do not buy any of the DLC, it mostly appears to be based around online which is dead"
"Got 5 + mates? Get this for the multiplayer shist and giggles, So many modes to keep it real and It always gives you the rush of beating you're mates for that 100% pure chat ♥♥♥♥ banter! 100% laugh not tried the single player mode tho don't think I will either :D Dont ram ya mates on corners ;)"
Better than project cars
7/10
"This is a racing game, where you race cars.  The graphics are very pretty.  You can put lots of little sponsor stickers all over your car, then they look just as ugly as real life tuning cars.  The controls are arcady, which is good thing since Gran Turismo sucks. You can rewind time if you crash.  The goal of the game (no joke) is to get lots of youtube subscribers.  The game is fun, played in little doses.  If you love playing it, you will die horribly, in a car crash."
This is th worst racing game I have ever played. Cars are like a piece of paper. THey are spinnig easily and even tackling in the air.
"Got 5 + mates? Get this for the multiplayer shist and giggles, So many modes to keep it real and It always gives you the rush of beating you're mates for that 100% pure chat ♥♥♥♥ banter! 100% laugh not tried the single player mode tho don't think I will either :D Dont ram ya mates on corners ;)"
Single Player is Good until it Gets Boring :D Online? Yes online Prepare to Get pick on And get Your ♥♥♥ Kicked By level 90s
In each tier there is 1-2 cars that is unbalanced &amp; everyone uses only those cars.
i crashed into a wall -&gt; +375 fans :D

"Pretty Nice, Ch3ck it 0ut!"
"Ahhh.... Grid 2 - gonna be the best game ever? NO! If in the first Grid franchise you were a new driver,completing races,challanges and quests to be the best of your team,then in Grid 2 you start in Chicago and then just drive,drive,drive and the best part is control of the car sucks ♥♥♥..  Codemasters rlly needed to think before they released this game... 00.000000/10 :( waste of ♥♥♥♥ing money"
outfull game so hard even after putting it at very easy difficulty even undercover is much better game
"I find this really nice game and it would be even nicer if ther were motorcycles. Please to the developers could, added structures their bikes? That would be really nice!!!"
"Ah Grid 2, the ugly child of Grid.   I've never played Grid, perhaps that eased me into it, and made it just a little bit less infuriating to get into. I've played allot of Grid 2 online, I've not touched on the single player (but from my brief peak, it looked rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the buying mechanics were off).   I've become very good at controlling the butter brick driving mechanics and consider this game to be a pick up and play sort of thing. The butter brick mechanics I've so aptly named makes the game a noble effort to gently encourage your car (this being the butter brick) in the direction you want it to career. But after hours of tedium you begin to master this and the driving becomes very arcade-y, and very fun.   Online, people are reckless and cause massive pileups on the initial corners of the track, which often screw your race up; but if you drive cautiously you can come out on top almost all the time. The rest of it is fun; the game is undoubtedly pretty and runs like a dream.   I recommend this, but not for a simulator, or anyone looking for a 'realistic' experience."
"I know people say that some race games are better, even people say that the original GRID is better than GRID 2, but in my eyes, GRID 2 is easily my favorite racing game I have ever played, I finished this game a while ago but recently i went over my steam library and saw this game, it brought back membories. If you want a great singleplayer racing game then this is one of the best choices i know currently. There is multiplayer but nobody plays multiplayer anymore because this is a old game. But other than that great racing game."
 In my opinion one of the best driving games on the market for people who dont look for a very realistic simulation ! 
"Impossible to control, even on very easy difficulty. Would not reccomend. I say this by using a keyboard, I can believe if u have a decent wheel it may well be a good game, but this is my opinion."
awsom race game this is not a sim butt just pure addrenilen rush
really solid racing sim
"cant even play it, crashes after startup"
is not working !!! please do something ! some kind of lauch fail &amp; so much people have this problem!!!! fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Could've been a good racing game but sadly it's being let down by pretty much all of it's parts. I can accept arcadey physics and handling as long as car behaviour is at least somewhat plausible. In this game however seems to be made with the sole purpose of looking cool from the outside. If you have the slight interest in driving and racing just stay away from this one. It's about style, not much else. Also every single design choice seems to be made to make the experience as annoying as possible."

The rest of it is fun; the game is undoubtedly pretty and runs like a dream.   I recommend this, but not for a simulator, or anyone looking for a 'realistic' experience."
"I know people say that some race games are better, even people say that the original GRID is better than GRID 2, but in my eyes, GRID 2 is easily my favorite racing game I have ever played, I finished this game a while ago but recently i went over my steam library and saw this game, it brought back membories. If you want a great singleplayer racing game then this is one of the best choices i know currently. There is multiplayer but nobody plays multiplayer anymore because this is a old game. But other than that great racing game."
this game sucks
OMG WHAT A GAME! ITS BETTER THAN NFS! But graphics is not that good..
This game cool because it is a fairly cheap game that will satisfy you if you arent too picky.
One of the best Racing Games i ever played!
I Hate it. Can't even play it. It says 'Pentium blablabla is required...'
The most stupides controls car driving game I have ever played
Grate game I enjoy this.  nice damige showing cars are nice bulded. been nice if hase ben beter stearing but owerole awesome I recommend this game to all ho love racing/sport games ;)
i hate this game
This is a very good raceing game.
'One of the best racing games on Pc'
"Buy,play, and FEEL it !!"
"Great Simulator, Great Mechanics, Great Graphics and Great Game..."
Physics are deep sh**. Barely touch anything = 360*
It's not the latest game on Steam...but is glitched beyond comparison to Assasian's Greed...  Would I reccomend a game that doesn't work/when It works it performs horrible? Nope.   Software issues aside if you have no problems running the game it looks decent and it's mediocre-ly fun with the free Derby DLC. Personally I own too many Deathmatch Derby games to be something new to me and I have played better games so a solid 6/10 from me.
The Best *^*
"I find this really nice game and it would be even nicer if ther were motorcycles. Please to the developers could, added structures their bikes? That would be really nice!!!"
"Impossible to control, even on very easy difficulty. Would not reccomend. I say this by using a keyboard, I can believe if u have a decent wheel it may well be a good game, but this is my opinion."
awsom race game this is not a sim butt just pure addrenilen rush
 In my opinion one of the best driving games on the market for people who dont look for a very realistic simulation ! 
"Had much fun playing the single player campaign. There is not much of a story, but I don't think the game would really need one. It's just about driving - and the driving feels good. There is a huge amount of cars and each one feels different to drive.  Never touched the multiplayer though."
"I like the graphics of the game and thats it! The physcs is horible! you have a paper car driving at some unholy speeds, you slow down to take the corner and what do you know....you still go into a damn tail step and clap the wall! Then o make it worst you pin all accross a 4 lane F#@%^&amp;! Highway..... I played this for hours and I can not say it has all been fun. If you're getting this at 75% off you can consider giving the first 3 seasons a try they weren't too bad.  Warning!!! You will get fraustrated and delete it! Like i did."
i thought i was buying a raceing game not a bumper boats simulator. its a game about takeing a zig- zag of a track and shoveing cars with wheels made of wet soap on the road and knocking everyone else out of the game by raming them into walls. the physics are faulty and cheating is more than encoraged. ive seen indie developers make beter racing games than this.

SInce when did I have a garage to fit so many cars? I find this game to be very ignorant of climate change. The cars are extremely polluting to the environment. Can they add some hybrid cars like the Prius or maybe even Tesla? I'm just trying to bring up the issuse of climate change.
"This game is fun to play, but its so damn frustrating losing all time the connection to the game servers, so I quit this game."
bad ai. break too early. not fast enough.
"horrible controls, centered around drifting. Really awful. Autosport, however, is amazing."
"Got it on Humble Bundle like 2 years ago or smth so can't get a refund but it's total wank. holy hell. So sloppy that turns become drifts and drifts turn into doom and despair.   The minimap works for like NFS, but this is just track racing. So it's ♥♥♥♥.   Just play Gran Turismo 1.  "
Love the game
"toxic, but good"
"GRID 2 like its predecessor is an amazing and solid racing game. Unlike the 1st game there is no longer a cockpit view and the control of the cars is extremely arcady but once you get past these points what you get is an extremely satisfying and rewarding racing game. The campaign isn't as long as in the 1st game but the multiplayer portion is alot better with more game modes, things to unlock and cars to buy. 9/10"
Very bad control for a car racing game
"Got it when it was for sale, now i wait for the next to get the DLC package :D  Update : even ther online is still alive and you can play with friends together"

This game sucks and that's all there is to it.
torrented this game a few years ago (before i know abt steam. yes i know its dumb) now playing it again bcs y not.  9/10 even tho AI is dumb af
most toxic game ever :D
THAT IT IS NOT FOR FREE   DONT RECOMEND IT IS NOT FREE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Don't bother buy this ♥♥♥♥ game. Not duable when you begin and settings don't stick.  You aim for a day match you get night and so on.
"Rubberbanding AI, no cockpit view, cars control like ♥♥♥. AI is absolutely idiotic."
"Grid 2 is a great game based on certain conditions. First, Grid is a great game if you already own it and you got it on sale. Do not buy this. Second, Grid is a great game if your hand eye coordination is lacking and you dont like cars driving like they do in the real world. Three, Grid is a great game if you hate customization of any sort, i mean absolutley loathe it. Finally Grid 2 is the best racing game in the genre of 'Racing sequels to games that start with the letter G and end with D and whos middle letters ryhme with Pi' GOOD JOB CODEMASTERS!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO."
"Amazing, Realistic, And Entertaining. BUY THIS FREAKING GAME"
10/10 would play again
"You get a really small variety of cars with the base game. I'd say at most, you get maybe 15? Then theres a ton more in DLC packs. If I didnt buy this game for $1, and was able to get the Grid 2 All in One DLC for like $6, I'd feel really quite ripped off.  However, online is fun. All the cars feel different. Driving feels great.   Except for the beginning of races with more than 4 people. The beginning is like a ♥♥♥♥ing demoliton derby. If you're in first, steer the hell out of anyones way. If you're in the middle, you're pretty lucky.   I cant tell if a lot of the community is trolling or just really terrible at racing. I'll be slowing down at a corner, like most people do, and this idiot rear ends me, makes me spin out, and slams into the wall. Sometimes I'll hear them laughing, other times I can just see that they're really terrible. I'll look behind me and see this guy trying to take turns going way too fast and slamming into a wall or going off track. Either way, trolling or terrible skill, its really annoying getting slammed by them and then your car is just destroyed, and you fall way behind.  But after a while you get used to it, and learn to stay the hell away from people, and pickout the trolls/idiots and the people who actually want to race.   A con is that theres only upgrading and modding your vehicles on multiplayer. Single player is pretty much you getting a pre setup car, and taking it for racing. I dont get why they went this route instead of letting us having modding on and offline. Eventually, this games online will completely die out. Online is nearly dead.   If you play on American servers, for whatever reason its super dead. Switch your download settings to London UK, and you'll find matches much more often."

"Haven't played much yet, but I absolutely enjoyed every moment of playing it so far!"
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The AI has been programmed to ram you into the first wall no matter the race mode or the diffuculty level. It is unplayable.
"Not plain good, not plain bad. A game wonderful in controversial feelings it induces, the one you never know what will do next -- either show you heavens or throw you into the rift of despair."

"this game is good and fun to play but it crashed for me twice within 90 minutes i dont know whats wrong but , i would not recommend this game for low spec pc but if ur a fan go ahead buy the same prob will happen to you i bet"
"I thought the game was pretty fun when I first started it. BUTTTT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I have to go do something, so I quit out the game and when I come back, I can't even get past the title screen. I'll recommend this game if this issue is fixed."
"After wadding through 500 menus, I got to a race, by that time, I had other things to do, but to quit out of the game, that meant, wadding back through those same 500 menus, task manager to the rescue!"
"Let me sum up my feelings for GRID 2, in one word.  Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh."
"I am NOT a racing game fan. I find racing games difficult to get into, often counterintuitive to control, and unnecessarily restrictive with cars and tracks.  Also, I'm terrible at it.  However, I found myself in the mood for a fun racing game after playing GTA V with its many amazing modded cars, and saw GRID 2 on the Lunar New Year sale, so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  PROS:  - GRID 2 doesn't punish hilariously inept racers like me from the get-go. It does a great job of easing you in, and you can start on noob settings, like I did, or try genuinely difficult settings. It's great for all skill levels.  - It's FUN! Some racing games feel stressful. GRID 2 doesn't. The game does a good job of capturing the joy of driving.  - The controls feel INTUITIVE! You know how the best games almost make you 'feel' obstacles with your controller, mouse, joystick or steering wheel? The games that make you duck IRL when you're flying below something, or recoil to dodge a projectile or piece of shrapnel? GRID 2 is the racing version of that. The controls feel completely natural from the start, and they are equally precise.  - The cities are lovingly rendered. You can race through Barcelona and see the Sagrada Familia looming over the streets; rocket through brightly lit Hong Kong at night; cruise Dubai's ultra-modern tracks; race in the shadow of the Eiffel tower...and on and on. The background art in this game is spectacular.   - It's well optimized. Framerate holds up fantastically, and I'm using a GTX 760, not the worst but not the best either. The important thing is, this game runs incredibly smooth, something that's always appreciated in a game where twitch response is important.  - The cars are awesome. It's not exclusively supercars, although the game has its share of Paganis and McLarens. There are American muscle cars, drift cars from Nissan and Honda, and high-performance vehicles from makers like BMW, Audi, etc. The paint options are legion, with a shading system to get the exact colors you want, and choices between things like metallic, matte, pearlescant, flip, etc.  - The game can be set to speak your real name, and your racing team leader gives you helpful tips when you're on the track or practicing. It's all situational, and so far it hasn't been repetitive at all.   CONS:  - While you can choose from any track (or so it seems) in custom events, you still have to unlock cars in career mode, unfortunately.   - You can change wheels, but it's not clear if they're anything more than aesthetic changes. That's fine with me, but maybe some people would want more depth.  - I'm not Vin Diesel.   OVERALL: Would recommend, even for terrible racers like me. Most of all, it's FUN."
"What are grand turismo , forza motorsport or need for speed ? They are in rubbish bin due to the release of grid 2.  Because this game is so great, great enough that Grid 2 you must NOT to buy becaue others racing game titles are not longer to be fun after this.   Thus, I highly NOT recommend you to buy the Racing game of the Decade - Grid 2 ! Especially in sales.  But please do consider buy the vanilla game in full price + All dlc in full price or ...........  Go grab this  http://www.codemasters.com/uk/article/125-000-grid-2-mono-edition-the-world-s-most-expensive-videogame/   FOR THE GREEDY CODDIES. "
"Dis gaem is liek crash kart wif betr graphex, it was rely fun"
Simplified but addictive ....
One of the best racing games in years.
"It has no right handling control without the controller, plus the players from different countries are cheaters as ever. You do not want to meet them in multiplayer, trust me they will ram and disqualify you intstantly?!"
"GRID 2 is awfull.  Not for the reasons you'd expect,  The sounds are amazing. The Handling is amazing. The Story is amazing.  But,  There is no cockpit view, which simply makes the game unplayable.  Welldone Codemasters - Well recieved as the best in the driving game industry have simply created a piece of garbage."
GAYEST GAME U COULD EVER PLAYED CARS ARE WACK AS HELL MAPS ARE ALL THE GAME AND THE HOLE GAME IS JUST DRIVE IN AH POINT LESS CIRCAL SO JUST GO BACK TO TH EMARKET AND GET GTA 5 OR SOMETHING ELSE CAUS ETHIS IS HORIBLE JUST ADD IT TO THE DELETE GAME STACK ALONG WITH OTHER RACEING GAMES CAUSE THEY ALL THE GAME ONLY ONE THATS WORTH GETTING IS DIRT 2 AND DIRT 3 THATS IT EVERY ONE ELSE TRASH EM JUST GET RID OF THEM BY BYE DONT ASTE MONEY ON THIS CRAP
"This game is such a let-down in terms of playability because it suffers from the 'Black Screen Crash' and unfortunately no one is taking responsibility nor prepared to fix the issue. A number of workarounds have been posted here on Steam and on various websites and after trying out many of the suggestions I have managed to play the game for short periods of time before the inevitable crash occurs. Therefore I do not recommend this game which clearly suffers from bad programming , it is a game which should never had been sold to the public in it's current state. If this were a hardware product it would have not been sold in the first place because it would be classed as faulty goods, I don't see why any digital product should be any different. "
"I'm used to playing simulator games, and i saw a lot of positive reactions so i thought i could give it a try. If you are used to playing sims instead of arcade do not buy this game, i only played 1.2h because i was very soon annoyed buy the handling physics. I'm not saying the game is bad, just saying this isn't a game for me. I've never read a comment concerning this so i thought it would be nice somebody said this."
""
"Just like any other need for speed or non-interesting racing game out there, Grid 1 had something unique to offer but this one didn't. I bought it and got very disappointed because it is nothing like its predecessor and doesn't deserve the number 2 in Grid 2."

Nice game.
our friend died in a kina shortuc
It is not a racing game.
"I really hate this new trend where game sequels are now crap compared to their predecessors, where all of the substances and originality of the first game is tossed away in favor of generic, trend tedium that we have seen in a million other games. Buy Grid 1, it's better. On it's own merits, Grid 2 is about average or slightly better than your average racer. Grid 1 is a 3rd the price though and superior in most ways. Aside from being completely linear with no real choice in what races to compete in (and a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of completely bland cars), Grid 2 takes itself way too seriously and sacrifices game modes and gameplay for flashy cutscenes."
"I am a fan of racing games and especially the codemasters franchise.   Grid 2 doesn't disappoint, though I like the atmosphere of Dirt 2 much better. Also I wish there was a way to skip the intro movies and splash screens.  "
I sold my Awp Factory new stat trak Worm God for this. (Skin was sold for 6 bucks and game was on sale for 6)                                     Was worth it
Not as good as the first. they took out the good drifting and replaced it with ♥♥♥♥. the racing is more arcadey then the first...not worth the money.
"If you have played this and you like it, you probably touch children"
I cant seem to get fullscreen in the game
Its good if you havnt played the 1st one.
""
8/10 ! good game ! demolition derby or run !!!!! The game have beautifull graphics....nice gameplay....it's between a need for speed and grand turismo ! if i can say that like that
One of the best PC racing games of all times. This game is a must buy.
This game sucks.
I would not recommend buying this game! Compared to Grid 1 (which is one of my fav racing games of all time) the cars feel wonky and uncontrollable. They break out in corners and as the driver you constantly feel like you're not in control! This sucks! I can never play this game more than 15 minutes....because the uncontrollable cars drive me crazy! Shame....this could have been an amazing game if it would've been a bit closer to the first part!
"AI ramming you up the backside all the time. One example is winning the race with 10 seconds to go and get rammed into a wall and car dies so I just wasted 6 minutes for nothing. The better the car the worse the handling gets to the point of being on icy with no grip because the game wants you to drift everywhere. The commentator keeps talking about having to fix the car, which doesn't matter as you don't have money and it is his job to fix the car so why not stfu? The cutscenes for your career feel so cheap and tacky and this game is nowhere near as good as the original Grid, which also had a car cockpit which Codemasters taken out of this Grid."
"You get bored of it fast, but it had on sale.. -75%!  If It was -100%, I'd say it was worth every penny. ;)"
"Sad sequal to grid 1 simply because Codemasters is lazy. The game is pay to win, excessive poor quality dlc for a poor quality base game. Its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ frankenstein between sim and arcade- most cars are undrivable. Multiplayer is deserted. Single player is dry. Need I mention no cockpit view?   TL;DR Cash cow for Codemasters."
"  OK so, after probably 5.6 hours of literally sitting around in the menus, and tabbing out the game to find a solution to the game crashing every 3 minutes, i found a solution that works for me. If you want to know it, ask me below, because i dont feel it is the right place to do it in the review. I really do feel like the dev's of this game (Codemasters) are ignorant by not fixing this problem as it seems to be persistent through many computers. Moving on, back to the review, i DO NOT recommend it, it is utterly useless. I did not buy the game, it came with the PC i bought and i thought i would try it out. But dont think about buying it. The game is not realistic at all in my opinion, unless you think that theres lubricant on the road 100% of the time. Using a Logitech G27 it is impossible to drive, going around a little corner and it slips, even without accelerating on it. On the other side of the game, the graphics are beautiful, very realistic looking. Not to mention the cheesy loading screens though, my eyes hurt after restarting the game a couple of times."
Best-buy it
"Well, it runs on half-decent potatoes..."
Actually a very good ' race / car ' game for how cheap it is!
tis a good racing game got it for cheap on humble bundle today with the dlcs def get it if ur into this shet
second part never be good
do not work at all... waste of money. Not even able to launch the game on win10.

This game has no skilled involved boring and gets old very quick i refunded it because of how boring
THERES LIKE 4 CARS EVERYTHING ELSE IS DLC.. ITS EA ALL OEVR AGAIN 
"GRID 2 is a game that I really recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - is a game with a wide variety of nice cars, nice maps, nice missions, nice landscapes etc. - this game stimulate your competitive part - has full controller support - it has trading cards - is a truly racing game - has multiplayer mode and... why you don't try?  Enjoy!"
"bad mechanics, drifting all the time, different track everytime, so forget about remembering which turn is next.if you bump into AI in front of you, you may already restart the race. impossible to keep on the track, but if you bump - some tracks will just stop you, some will turn you."
Now people who say that its like driving on ice should try taking a rear wheel car and go full speed and turn their wheel ful left or right and see what happens. Because if you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you dont understand when you play on keyboard and when you press right the cars wheel turns full right because its a ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard not a steering wheel. Besides if you really think you just going to slowly turn right or left while driving over 150 killometers per hour and think you not going to slide. Then my friend you are a ♥♥♥♥ing moron
"The Graphics are nice , good sound and good handling of the cars :) First it wont run on my pc , but than i fixet it :D look  here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xJ4P6NHIr0&amp;list=WLO5uD4tSWJ2afd36vC8smNAnh_BaciuwE  Bad is that so much cars are in dlcs but good! Its not a bad game but most people have problems to run it !"
"An ambitious but seriously flawed sequel that strayed too far from its origins. PC glitches, poorly managed and overpriced downloadable content and the absence of a clean racing mode greatly shorten the play life of this arcade racer."
"Decent game.  Playability, very similar to Grid 1.  Longevity, depends on whether you want to drop 30 snots for DLC. Plenty of playtime without, though. Reliability - honestly, terrible. Ridiculous bugs that plagued DiRT 3 are still present. Overall - no way do I recommend this game, until such a time as the bugs are ironed out (which won't happen) and the DLC drops in price.  Update 5th/October/2014 - to date, still no patch to fix the bugs since I originally reviewed this on 3rd/December/2013. And, of course, no patch in sight, seeing as the same bugs have carried over to it's predecessor. And a tech support team who aren't in any way familiar with it's products.  Codemasters..... Code....Masters?? Hmmm..."
worst game ever i've played
Good game if you need a game to play with a Controller.
Fantastic game. Still holds up as one of the best racing games on PC.
Dont buy this
"Dislike, no controller support, if you use Controller DONT BUY"
it's more grid 1.5 but not bad
"I didn't play more than 50mins of this game to know how horribly unrealistic it is.  When you're like me who has been playing GRID 1 for so many hours, loving the feel of the cars and the looks of the game, and then you jump to GRID 2 thinking 'How in the world could GRID 2 be that much better, because GRID 1 already is the best racing game I've played.' then you sit down and watch as your car hits an invisible wall at 80mphs and all your car does is bounce off of it like a trampoline and have little to no damage, when you expected to fly off the ♥♥♥♥ing cliff and watch your driver and car just get destroyed.  Don't waste your money on GRID 2 or GRID Autosport. Just buy GRID 1 and enjoy the beauty of it!"
"Fanstastic game, but broken on Windows 10."
Code'Masters' Nuff Said.
Just as the trailer in the game!
Nice Graphics!!!
"Not as good as Dota 2, but it is still really fun"
I liked this game. Graphics are wonderful. You can play online.The sound is good. I recommend this game.
"Lost save after 14 Hours, ♥♥♥♥ this. Mby not use japanese confirm- cancel options when asked to remove/overwright your saves. Not doing 14 hours work again. Use a better profile save system, even skyrim has backups, what is this, Forza 1?"
Think of a song you like now look at this game you probably hate that song now and will never listen to it again  Spice Girls I'll tell ya want i want a 10 nuh uh uh uh zzzzz zero
Now I know I shouldn't buy a car.  10/10 thanks codemasters

waste of money... - no in car camera - ai is too aggressive  game is too damn hard to win... GRID 1 was way way batter and easier.
"horrible handling/steering, like they couldn't decide if they were making a realistic or arcadey racer, how do people like this?   also no subtitles? in a 2013 game? think of our deaf gamers pls"
"PROS: Nice Graphics Realism  CONS: Be aware, everyone with a 500, 600 and 700 series Nvidia cards have major compatibility issues. The game is unplayable if you have an Nvidia GPU, every 10 minutes your PC's GPU will freeze and you will probably need to reboot the PC. Terrible coding for Nvidia cards from Codemasters. This is a known issue since release and there is not a workable fix, even Nvidia blaims that on the game's coding.  All in all a good racing game, but I will not support Codemasters again if they stick to terrible Nvidia GPU porting."
"Worst game ever. The coding/installation files for this game are absolute PANTS. DO NOT BUY IT!!!! I cannot get the game to work. I was able to play it for a couple of hours and have followed all of the different forum posts on how to fix this game and stop it crashing, but that's all it does, its garbage. Don't waste your money. The two hours I played were good, but what good is a game that you can't play? Disappointed. FIX YOUR GAME!"
Weary good game nice graphics the only thing i dont like is that y have to buy dlcs to get some cars :(

always crash
Horrible FPS drops. Constant crashes. Autosave problems. DLCs. No cockpit view. Horrible car handling. Terrible voice acting. DLCs. Dead online community. Very slow menu transitions. No plans for future patch support. DLCs.
♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥
Fun career mode with both muscle cars and technical drifting.  Online is also pretty good with multiple game modes to keep things interesting.  Worth picking up on sale   Watch out for polish players - they are crazy suicidal behind the wheel.
Cool
"I really like this game. Best arcade racer since the good old days of NFS. The visuals are satisfying, the game is very well optimized and it runs flawless. With my G27, it's a gem."
"I am appauled so far that Steam would not test a game on the mac platform ,this is evident as when you start up the game and press the enter button to start playing it chrashes to desktop ! Help me someone"
I can play this game while smoking 10/10 - IGN
this game is for ni ggers
It's like skyrim with cars
I downloaded it for the local multiplayer... but it doesn't have local muiltiplayer.
"better than nfs, too bad you cant use any of the dlc online, so avoid them at all cost."
i dont have this game but i can somehow write a review on it
"Awful because you can't skip cutscenes. You can't even alt tab and let it play in the background, it pauses the moment you alt tab."
If you like Grand Theft Auto then you should get this game right now.
Insta refund on first lap
"terrible game, no money, cant mod your cars, very bad in my opinion, was told i could do these things and even in steam sale for £5 hasnt tempted me to keep it, right waste of money, time and effort making a game you can use money on"
"Very good game, lot of fun to play, online is a challenge, but can be wuite fun once you start leveling up and earning money and unlocking new cars."
waste of money
This is one of the best games ive ever played. Cars. Booms. Bangs. Why not.
So recommend. Such race. Many simulate. 10/10
"+Good single player +Enough cars +Feels like an arcade (good imo) +Great graphics that run perfect! +Awsome MP  -Not a great story, but good enough -Geels like an arcade game (Like I said imo good, but for some people bad)  8/10, defenitly worth a try ;)"
Great Racing Game!
"Only english settings without a tyre pressure, supension hight, or power transmission and ratio for 4wd is not it, or chip tune even if it is previous version sold in many copies. The Q is how can you sell improved game without off it?  If no one ask, it is so?  Game logic drives a car as artifitial cookie, totally unrealistic with track !"
Perfect!
its a good game but hard to find player in multiplayer 
"An all round great racing game. Its a lot of fun to play, even after playing about 4 hours straight. The game has very good physics and the graphics are beautiful. The game is challenging to play but not too difficult and has great cars to drive and customize (mine are all pink and black). I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes cars or racing games."
"On the positive side, the graphics, choice of cars and tracks are great.   The thing that really ruins it for me is the steering and handling of the cars. Virtually all of the cars are geared towards drifting. The upshot of this is that it leaves little room for different driving styles and ensures that your car goes wildly out control for no apparent reason. Completely ruins the gameplay.  If you were considering a purchase of GRID 2, I would strongly suggest checking out the first GRID, as the gameplay in the latter is far superior."
Good arcade style racing.
"I would only recommend this for the hardcore race fans for 1 simple reason, the controls are so touchy, even a small mistake can send you into the wall. Possibly the most realistic racing game i have ever seen in terms of physics, this will frustrate new players. However, if you want a challenge, then you have found it. 4/5"
"If you like cars, you might like this."
"This game requires fast PC! but I love it though, It has a nice graphics. Recommended for all players :)"
Arcade racing with distinctive car personalities and ultra-responsive controls. Easier difficulties make this great for those who are new to serious racing games! 8.75/10
"Really god game,and fun"
Good racing game. It is not to loyal to real physics but it is okay. Worth if it's in deal.
"Nice racing game, doesn't feel quite as polished as the first though.  Online play is pretty good if you can find the people."
its really bad
Highly recommended racing game.
Racer for the serious types. Still fun and lots of super cool cars. Will race again!
"Pros: better graphics and more cars than grid 1  Cons: cant modify cars in career mode, more of NFS racing style than racing simulator.  Overall: 7.5/10"
"For the price I bought (6 euros) it is worth it. Full price, never. Pros:   - Great sound  - Good controls  - Good graphics  Cons:  - Biggest con is how unfair it is. Doesn't matter how good you are, how many 1st positions you got, you will ALWAYS start at 5+ if not last position. - CPU racers will ALWAYS spin you out while you can't do anything to them. If you 'crash' into them they just go as nothing happened.  - Flashback doesn't work 50% of the time you need it"
really fun but kinda unrealistic
Awsome Game =)
Great game... But the devs decided to remove the 'incar' camera view for some reason. At least there's a mod for it :P
"One of the best racing games ever. We can wonder whether it's better than first GRID or not, but it doesn't make sense. Both are amazing. The main difference is that GRID 1 was a little bit more simulation, but the truth is, that both are arcade racing games. Some of the players are disillusioned with GRID 2, because it's possible to drift through almost every corner, which is not very realistic, but... hell, it gives so much fun! :) Autosport, which was supposed to combine all qualities from previous games from GRID series, is soo boring - I really don't like it. So, if you are wondering which one to buy (1 vs. 2), well, buy both of them. You will not be disappointed!"
Good game. Sick maps. Great graphics. Nice cars. BEST RACER EVER!!
I thought was very good in car games but Grid showed me that was not. Maybe it's my computer or maybe i'm realy a bad player.  Whatever... It is a good game with a good graphics and i dont say nothing more at the moment..
This game is awesome. It has a ♥♥♥♥ing split screen!! i never expected that. 10/10 SP+MP. 
"awesome game really recommend this game for people who likes to play reacing games. this game shows stunning graphics(even on lowest), amazing gameplay and takes time to master. there are challenging race cources to race on and several other places like a racing stadium or a mountain pass to a city cource. i enjoy all the time that i have played this game.  so on a scale of 1-10 id rate it 9"
Grid 2 is a really fun game that seems to work surprisingly well on most computers from 2006 on up. I have a 6 series low profile graphics card in my Dell Optiplex 745 and the game plays pretty flawlessly on low or medium settings. The graphics do glitch every now and then and when I hit a wall the screen glitches but I beleive that to be my Processor which is a Pentium D. With the setup Im running the game plays surprisingly well and I couldnt be happier. The game does have a career mode and a online mode. It looks like you have all the tracks unlocked but not all the cars. You play to unlock cars and upgrades I beleive... If you love racing cars and videogames then you will love this game! Get it!
so good one)
Really good game  and amzaing graphicks for the price
"Pros  - Good plot/story line  - Easy to get in to, still challenging  - Sweet graphics, nice foliage and trees  - One of the better livery/decal systems I've seen  - Drifting is easy/fun  - Special events like overtake are really fun and a nice change of pace  - Road/coastal/highway courses add a nice variety   Cons  - User interface is clunky at times, loses my settings, making it frustrating to use the game  - No tuning options/suspension tweaking except in multiplayer  - Fewer cars and choices for cars than in some other games  Some people complain that there is no cockpit view. While this is true, it's also something I don't mind as there is bonnet and bumper cam, which effectively do pretty close to the same thing.  Overview  This is a drifer's dream game. The handling is true to each car's unique tendencies but various effects have been put in place so you don't slide out as much as you would in real life. I quite enjoy the handling, it feels very responsive in general and I love the ease with which I can slam a Camaro into a drift at full speed and still recover. Probably not realistic, but tons of fun pulling massive drifts with ease, and I like that the feeling of each car still represents the general feel of that car in real life.  The custom game setup doesn't remember any of the choices I've made and it's easy to wipe out my selections and have to start over or not realize I'm not in the right race until I get to a track I didn't expect. Having to constantly swipe through tons of tracks to find the one I want every time is annoying. I like that there are lots of tracks, I don't like that the UI doesn't' remember the one I was on and doesn't have a better way to search for the tracks. This last bit is something that should change, but I put up with it because the game itself is so fun.  I've heard people complain that there aren't enough tracks but I have been plenty sastisfied with the variety of tracks. I'm sure if you play a game for long enough, any game can become boring, but people who like football don't think football is boring just because it's played on the same type of field each time. I don't think racing is boring just because I'm racing the same track. With a different car, it's practically a new course to learn anyway, and lap times can probably always be improved. So far, I'm quite satisfied with the variety of tracks in this game.  That brings me to the cars. There are plenty of cars, but not as many as in some other titles, for sure. I don't feel particularly lacking in car varieties, but it does seem like the car choice is a bit limited, even after unlocking lots of cars via the challenges. Overall, I don't find this to be that bad, but I would have liked more car varieties."
Had this game for a while now and love it. I was playing it on my old Lap Top Acer 6930G and it was good on low to med settings. Just got this new Lap Top and all I can say is WoW . What a difference like night and day. With all the setting full its better than real.
"Good game, nice selection of cars, physics and handling are great, wish you could mod your car and the graphics do feel a little out dated though. Works perfectly with the G27, without further configuration."
Fast based car game. Car damage physics and driving itself is ok. Good racing game with friends!
so very grid eww cate is like racing game me no like
Wow! Just finished playing this with a force feedback steering wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) and it was incredible. Feel good about spending the very reasonable amount of coin on the wheel and thankful for Steams Thanksgiving deals for Grid 2.
"dis ♥♥♥♥, grid 1 was much better. this is boring. And the FOX news crap, is just bullsh#!. Makes me feel like a peice of sh!#"
Bought it thinking it was another awesome game from CodeMasters... wanted to play online and couldnt wait for my TrackIR to come tommorrow. turns out. there are rarelly a game to play online and there is no vanilla cockpit view (wich i thought it would have. since its a MUST for racing games today). i feel like i wasted my money.
"A good game,, with potential tobe even better !!! Graphics are mind blowing ,physics of the cars are great, game play is taxing .... In General I#m loving it !!!"
Cool racing game. Nice balance between simulation and arcade. Excellent when below 10€!
"...Sigh. So much potential, only to be mediocre, bland, and uninspired. I'm buttmad about the removal of the helmet cam, and the vehicle physics are extremely odd. Not to mention the AI seems like it was taken straight out of Twisted Metal or Rogue Trip, as their primary objective seems to be to murder you, instead of finishing first.  It's decent, and only decent. It tries too hard to be two things and it fails at both; it is neither a redline arcade racer, or an intense sim experience. Everything feels watered down and stripped, including the car roster. It would be a little more forgivable if they gave you more cars in every class to play with, but as it stands the roster is very ho-hum and forgettable.  It's a little sad, because the mobile game Real Racing 3 feels more like a true sequel to GRID than GRID 2 does."
Pros - variety of races - has some great cars (DLC) - onlines dead because autosport is better  Cons - they forgot that ferrari and lambo exist - seriously how can you not put in the 458 or aventador? - nowhere near as good as the original - the some great cars are mostly DLC
"A little arcade-y for some people, but the game is still beautiful and amazingly fun to play!"
almost as good as the 1st one but still dam good!!
It has fast cars. I recomend this product.
Realy love the game only have one problem this is cos i come from New Zealand... The Bathurst Track Pack has NO Holdens in it. It give you a skyline and 2 fords but no Holdens... Apart for that its a realy good game...
"Grid 2 truly is an excellent racing game. Firstly, it is very well optimised, running smoothly whilst still looking pretty good even on my crappy laptop. Handling strikes a nice balance between sim and arcade. It's easy enough to get the hang of but rewards those who are more skillful particularly on braking and turn in. The different handling models feel distinct and from my multiplayer experience there isn't one with a severe advantage over the other. I also think the seperation of single and multiplayer works in the game's favour since moving from one to the other feels fresher than in other games (though some shared progress would have been appreciated). The multiplayer is the stronger of the two but the single player does have some very good qualities. The game does a great job at creating a convincing scenario for the campaign to take place in and the first half in particular is a lot of fun. However, I found the last season of WSR to drag on a bit due to some tracks being used considerably more than others (if you prefer street circuits you won't have as big an issue with this) though event variety helped aleviate this. Also the car balancing within the classes was questionable at times and in Tier 3 I experienced one event where I felt I could only win in the Caterham/Ariel Atom group though keep in mind this may have been down to me prefering a grip based driving style. Multiplayer is where you should spent most of your time as the playlist setup for online events is simple and easy to get addicted to. The learning curve was not as steep as I expected thanks to a decent starting car selection which I see being used by more experienced players quite regularly.  As for the lack of cockpit view. Its not a sim game. There's a hood cam. It does the job. Use that and have some fun."
:)
cool game easy to play and complete
Awesome Game! I highly recomend it for racing game fans!
"Would I recommend this to you? NO. Not a chance in hell. This isn't a fun game, it's not even a game. It's an engine and a demo, the rest of the game comes in DLC form. The whole concept here is pay-to-win, There's no pont in playing and trying to level up your character/garage as the level 1 DLC cars are faster, and handle better. DLC availible on day 1? SCAM. DO NOT BUY."
"Another great racing game. If you like racing games, this is a great addition and ranks among the best. Graphics are awesome--play is great.  "
This game is awesome. Best graphics ever. Best sound ever! Feels good playing on a computer when the format is like a PS4/Xbox. Love it!
When you fly off a cliff you can reverse time and not fall again. 8.5/10
Need more friends play together !
"Best racing game currently available, bar none. Outstanding physics, gorgeous environments, and a wealth of terrifically rendered cars to select from, ranging from classic American muscle to track specialists like Caterham to the hypercar elite like Koenigsegg. Customizable paint adds to the personalization factor of each vehicle. Go through career mode in the typical rags to riches format, pit your skills online against other racers, or simply do solo practice laps on the racetrack of your choice. At the very least, give the demo a once-over. You won't regret it."
"Little step behind compared to the Grid, especially in multiplayer game its not best as he culd be. But is still a very good racing game with beautiful graphics."
Make sure to change your steam download server to something in Europe if you want to find anybody to play online.  The game is region locked online.
"I have really been enjoying GRID 2. It is a hybrid sim/arcade racer. By that I mean you do need to break, and you do need to know how to go around corners, but with a very high incorporation of drifting and forgiveness. There are only two real downsides to this game: There are no online games anymore, rendering half of the game useless, and the AI can often times be infuriating. The AI very clearly has a set idea as to what it wants to do, regardless of where or what the players car is doing. There is very clearly no connection between the AI and where the player is."
awasome game
"It's just like any other codemasters racer really. It's got a bit too much focus on social integration, but it's an okay game. Completed it once before getting it on steam."
"dis ♥♥♥♥, grid 1 was much better. this is boring. And the FOX news crap, is just bullsh#!. Makes me feel like a peice of sh!#"
it's good but i hit the space to drift but s is brake 
So far I have barely played it buuuttt... seem super hard to get into for me (I am a fps gamer) and I feel the controls arent super reactive.. but I dont know much about racing games. 7/10
Pros:  -RACE FAST CARS -DRIFFFFFFFFFFFFFTS -IT LOOKS NICE Cons: -The announcers voice is annoying  9.8/10
"Havemt foun a nice racibg game like this for a while, but what the ♥♥♥♥ is with some of the lighting, ♥♥♥♥s up my vision of the track, so all i see id pink or green light, 9 times out of 10 i crash and it ♥♥♥♥s up the race for me "
"uninspiring racer its the in your face drive fast games, no real deapth at all."
It's a Blast... Love the Demolition Derby Pack a real hoot....SMASH-THEM UP!
"Not a fan of the 'make a mistake and you're done' approach to racing sims. Take a corner just a tad too tight and it's over. The fact that they had to keep that awful rewind mechanic should tell you it's not a game where you can catch up after mistakes. In the first GRID, it got old having to do that at least once every race, but I really hoped for a more balanced game the second time around."
"When I first heard of Grid 2 I thought cool as I've played Grid then I loaded it and there are less controls in G2 than Grid. The steering was so bad I could only get 10 feet down track b4 hitting and bouncing off the walls. In Grid you can adjust the steering sensitivity. I haven't tried the game now in over a year and hope it's been fixed. After tweeking the controler I was able to get 15 feet down track, WOW. I just bought a Xbox controler for windows and giving that a try b4 I delete GRID2 from my life."
"10/10 This is the best racing game I've ever played. The realistic car controls feel great, making the races much more difficult than Burnout, Forza, or Need for Speed. The campaign is the best of any racing game ever, because it not only feels more realistic, but it offers variety and options of how to do it, with many extra features. The online play is well-made, really the CS:GO of racing. It's quick, punishing, and requires honing your skills. No mouse support does drag this otherwise amazing game down, along with it being a bit of a CPU hog. Don't get me wrong, it runs, and has good graphics, but the graphics to memory ratio isn't great. Overall, I can't recommend this game enough."
"Brilliant arcade/sim racer, easy to master, long to complete. 8/10"
Very nice racing game!
"If you liked the first GRID game you'll probably like this one too, there are a few major differences tho, in this one you don't earn money and buy your cars, you just get them handed to you, and can get more cars through racing, and there's no team racing element in this either."
"totally i enjoyed playin this game thou,  very recommended for racing gamers!"
One of the best racing games.
I love this game fun something new for me to play you should buy it
Very good racing game.From me if you like racing games you have to play this game.
"Very much like the first game, if you liked that one, you'll like this one"
It may not be like GRID 1 but GRID 2 has won my interest on it's own merits. Recommended for arcade racing fans.
Really nice game. Love the graphics.
Grid One is better than Grid 2. Thats all.
If you like racing games check it out!
"Once you realize the only effective way to turn is by drifting, you realize that this game lacks versatility. I will admit it is fun for the first several hours of playing, though. If you can get it for very cheap, and you love racing games, this game's worth it. Overall, however, I'd say don't bother."
"Absolutely FANTASTIC!! this is the most realistic racing sim i'v ever played (aside from the whole rewind thing). The physics and gameplay are outstanding. However i would not recomend this game for the casual or amatuer racer. In its realism it is often very dificult. I would call myself an experienced racer and I play it on easy, frequently using the rewind feature (don't feel bad if you have to. I don't know if the game would even be possible without it). Also it MUST BE PLAYED WITH A GAMEPAD OR RACING WHEEL. Its physics are so realistic that to control your car you must be able to regulate the accelerator, not just have it floored all the time as with a keyboard. This game is highly underrated. I don't know why its not as well known as some of the other legit racing sims.The devs were unfalteringly focused on making it as realistic as possible. I think it's even more realistic than some of the more popular games like forza. So anyway, totally will not regret paying the $ for it if you're the kinda guy who lives in the race and isn't out to get a quick speed fix."
This game is the biggest load of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played. Honestly. The controls are EXTREMELY wonky and every tiny movement the wheels make causes a gigantic cloud of smoke that blocks all vision. Not to mention the unbelievable difficulty it would hold even if the controls weren't impossible. Terrible game.
"A very solid racer that's worth the cash. It handles a little more loose and fast than the first but I found it to be very enjoyable and it has maybe the best presentation of any racer I've played. My only complaints are that the game gets a little stale towards the end of the single player mode. You're shown all the tracks and modes within the first few hours of the game so the last couple of seasons are a bit tedious. I also wasn't a fan of how 'drifty' some of the top-end cars felt. Other than that, a very good racing game that I'm glad I bought."
"If you don't know much about car handling you may want to consider getting this game! If you don't mind racing online with 5-year old grown ups go get it! If you are a 5-year old &lt;&lt;please&gt;&gt; get it!  So what makes GRID 2 special is that it is old and you may be able to find it for a good deal. A few points below: + Good graphics + Quite some tracks + Many cars + Multiplayer actually seems to work better then in GRID Autosport (shorter waiting times, easy to join a playlist,...) - It appears that at least half of online racers are indeed 5 year old grown ups - Can handling is... well let's not talk about it... ARCADE  Check out the videos below:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMfW3Zteco&amp;list=PL1PUkgVzQJU4jBFaAp2c6NY4oYaHYSFa2 "
great racing game tho it could need a wider selection of cars
This is an OK game and worth buying but not a game I am likely to recommend. The difficulty really seems to ramp up at the end and along with increased track lengths the game gets quite tedious. In the end I dialled back the diffculty simply to stop myself becoming too bored. The rubber banding on the longer tracks is very noticable and good driving is not rewarded enough with descent gains.
Well now that I have gridautosport it seems unlikely i'll play this much again. So: The car handling physics are mental and the career mode is shambolic. However no matter how much codemasters claim this is the ultimate simcade the truth is that this game is a laugh. I've had more fun drifting gorgeous cars ( the graphics are suberb) in the 30 hours I've played on it (I know it says 74 but i accindently left it running for a couple of days) than if I played a solid week of playing dirt. And thats what this game is about- fun. So despite it flaws and the fact it dosn't really work as a racing game this game is what games are meant to be about - Fun. As a game i rate 6/10 as a truly worthy waste of time I rate 10/10.
"I am all for that. Great game, great sound. The game very addictive :)  Jestem jak najbardziej na tak. Świetna gra, świetny dźwięk. Gra bardzo wciąga :) "
"OLD REVIEW: 2 hours played so far. 1 hour yesterday, came back today and my progress was gone. The second hour of playing was trying some fixes from the internet i shouldn't have to do anyway just to play and driving the first track over and over again. Great thing that you can't check if saving works without driving the first track. Like first making a profile, nooooo, that would be to reasonable.  Online racing doesn't work either, i can find races but when they start i get disconnected.  I probably will try it in the future, maybe if it works then i'll change my review.  NEW REVIEW: Stuff works. Much nicer."
You did it again Codemasters....you did it again! Hat's off to you!
One of the best racing games out there (console exclusives included). It's great because it still has some kind of story and the racing mechanics just feel good.  8.3/10
It's really well made but unless you buy a bunch of the packs for this game it's unfair and the driving assist sucks if you see it contact me and turn it off becuase i lose races becuase of it overall this game is well made so i would recommend this game to people who like racing it has no story though it's more like oh your new come join us and race for us untill your done with your carrer then you can't go back once your done it sucks.
"One of the best racing games I've played. I sometimes find it too easy and the AI to be a bit rubber band-ish, but otherwise lots of fun! Do recommend :)"
"I haven't played a racing game for hours ever since Hot Pursuit. I love how it brings together simulation and arcade gameplay, so yeah. Pretty good."
"Meh, missing the European races. I'm not interested in American racing."
Racing on ice O_o
"Ever since I left my xbox 360, I've been looking for a racing game to replace the Forza Motorsport series. This one comes very close."
Totaly a great game!! Awesome graphics Nice physics Good carrier mode And a lot of fun on online multiplayer!
"Amazing car experience with a controller ( I use ps4 controller ). When I played the game with keyboard and mouse, I did not like it at all, but when I tried it with ps4 controller, absolutly amazing!"
A racing game with a lot of tracks and a good amount of cars (though more are added by DLCs). Controls are arcade. No cockpit camera view is available.   8/10
Very fun and easy to play!
"No cockpit view, but great graphics and easy to use arcade stlye handling and physics make this game fun!"
"Single: Annoying gameplay, annoying controls and very-very annoying car behavior/feedback/reaction - you feel sooo outrageously handicapped compared to the AI cars while playing it, no matter how hard you try. Even if I otherwise consider myself a higher-than-the-average-level racer, I just quickly lost interest in playing this game as it quickly set me on fire against the experience this game gave me...  Multi: Haven't played multi-player, though - but based on my single-palyer experience, I am not really inclined to even try it out.  Luckily, I bought this on a big sale for some very low bucks a while ago - thus I minimized risk and loss of money."
A must have... 
While not as good as its previous installment it is still a pretty solid game.
very fun and educational
The game is very funny.
"It just felt like the old days when i was a kid, and all i did was playing racing game and compete with my family. I love the graphics and the more you play the more you want to explore. Nice job peeps :)"
"GRID 2 is a fun racing with a lot of customization and possibilities. Instead of running a never ending campaign, GRID 2 allows you to choose what you want to do. The game is very user-friendly and it is easy to run on computers lacking 'hardcore' hardware. Definetly worth the price."
"Put simply - It's a really fun arcady sort of race game. Easy to get into and can be played in short sessions or over longer periods.  My only gripes are the price of the DLC and the akward navigation of the menu's which aren't exactly intuitive.  Using a 360 pad the controls feel great, I haven't tried the keyboard but I'd think it would take away a lot of the feeling of control.  Graphics are on a par with DiRT 3 and inlude some nice effects to add to the sensation of speed. It is apparent it's a console port but one thats been done to a satisfying level to please PC gamers.  It runs along nicely on my measly 1680x1050 resolution monitor, averaging 63fps on my ageing AMD 5870 and Phenom 2 1100T @ 3.8-4.2Ghz boost. That includes all settings maxed out apart from the nvidia only settings and AA set at 4x. I'm building a new system in a couple months so if I remember, I will come back and update this if it's possible.  Update: Ok I'm running it on a i7 4790k and GTX 970 on a 2560x1440 monitor. It's still great fun, the settings are all maxed including AA and it all runs great ! Some games have graphical problems running at 1440p but this one is fine."
"I am not a racing gamer by any means, but this game has me hooked. The career progression is fantastic and the unlockables keep you playing. The controls with an Xbox controller feel great and the graphics look amazing. If you get one racing game, I definitely recommend it be this one!  Edit: I feel I must mention this game is very unstable on windows 7. After many frustrating crashes (where I had to completely shut off my computer), I eventually gave up finnishing this game."
A comprehensive and fun racing game with solid collision physics.
"It's hard to say about this game mainly because it's a very good game and the game play, graphics, and cars are great. It's a perfect arcade racer and definitely the game for any driving fan. But here's the problem, Single player is fun and addicting, ask yourself do you like that car?? Guess what you're out of luck because in order to upgrade that car in Single player you need to play online and there's a huge problem with that due to the online is DEAD. No one is online at all so you'll have to play the weekly events if you wish to upgrade the car which if the online was still ALIVE I would recommend buying this game but since it's not. I'll say save your money and buy something else."
"I remember playing grid 1 on my old ps3 and this sequel was a terrific follow up to a great concept about you being a new driver in the professional scene. I highly recommend it to those that want a little something different (*cough, counter strike)"
"The quality is tip-top, the gameplay is very fun. I'd say it is on the sim side of arcade. It includes a 'reverse' feature, so if you completely crash and burn you can back up time and try the corner again. There is no open world in single player, you just advance your career by running formal race tracks against AI drivers (I have not tried out multiplayer so i can't comment on that).  The game doesn't provide a learning mode for beginners; it won't show you a good line for the turns, nor will it start you in low-end non-racing cars to learn how to drive. It just throws you right in, in a 'drift' car which can be hard to control. For beginners, here is the good news:   1) You don't have to win or even do well on the very first race; if you can get your car over the finish line in one piece they fall all over themselvels about how great you are.  2) After that, you can play 'custom events' all you want, with no impact at all on your career. They give you access to a huge variety of tracks to race in, and you can try out all your cars there too. If you are brand new, do this and switch to a 'grip' car; the handling makes cornering SO much easier, and that will help you get a feel for the game. Also, you can set the reverse feature to unlimited (normally you are limited to 5 reverses per race).  3) A few races in, you unlock the ability to test drive solo on a speedway, for more practice.  If you want to race some cars around, I recommend this game."
"Got four cars in less than an hour and they all feel about the same. GT2 and GT3 on the playstation were so awesome they've ruined me from all other racing games out there so far. Also, wtf is up with you starting out in a massively torquy RWD car for the first races when you're trying to get the feel for the physics in the game? Stupid. Start players out in an AWD or something and then go from there."
nice racing game and have really good crashing effect
"Seemed nice while I only had access to slow cars.  All started getting ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier after season 2 of WSR.  Pros: The graphics look great.  Cons: * AI always run on max speed in corners without starting to drift or spinout and the car type only changes how YOUR car handles, * Controls of this game are awful: even when using analog input, it's either max or zero turn left/right, * Some events don't allow to make a contact with other cars - it doesn't matter who hits who, you always get disqualified for that, * You're drifting 100% of the time: even when going without acceleration in corners, if you turn to the side, the car starts drifting.  Basically it's impossible to play this game if you don't get a good racing wheel for your PC. I started playing on medium difficulty, but in season 2 had to change to easy and in season 3 changed to very easy, as the cars got more and more uncontrollable, while the opponents were going at max speed with no control issues."
38 Minutes before I quit. I didn't like being pigeonholed into RWD drift setups. I may try it another day.
"Grid 2 is a very good game for arcade racers, this game is not a good simulator however even sim racers will have a good time with this one. This is honestly one of my favorite games of all time and I highly recomend it. 10 out 10 easy"
"Pretty good, I never really liked racing games but this game changed my mind."
Very happy
Not impressed. Not my type of racing game. To many American cars at the start which are very loose and tail happy.
"I would reccomend this, however i want more cars and not all dlc. otherwise I like it."
"The arcade racing is pretty weak, but the game is really beautiful"
"GRID 2 is a highly arcade racing game, you won't find any real simulations that obey laws of phisics here. Having this said, If you're into that cup of cha, you'll be delighted to play it.  + amazing graphics + interesting career mode + the feel of speed  - handling can be pretty awkward at times  8/10"
"I remember Grid 1 being a lot of fun. This on the other hand feels... very new age tween gamer.  Twiddling with the forced intro race, and trying to setup a Simraceway wheel (which was unmanagable), the entire grid finished the small circuit before I even started moving... and yet when I finished I received that annoying poitive reinforcement nonsense that is the reason why kids today are self entitled morons. Horribly late finish = OMG, that was amazing, all eyes were on you, that generated so much interest.  Forced, unskippable cutscenes = Check Decent though generic to Codemasters handling = Check (didn't feel engaging like Grid 1 did at the time)  And the visuals... lens flared street lamps during the day? That's just a cheap way out to add bells and whistles to an otherwise overglossed and unbalanced/unrefined art style.  All of those things are initial markers of what the game really is. Disposable and forgettable. I've played more than enough titles over the years to know that feeling of mediocrity at the start of a game that is just going to stay mediocre, at best.... and this is one of them."
"this game is terrible: -its hard to control the car, every car is like the roads are covered in ice.  -limited amounts of flashbacks -the menus, ugh -No music, come on.   pros: great graphics, but that's it."
"I have to say, after reading the reviews on this game, I wanted to be impressed. However, after about five seconds of playing on the first course I immediately wanted to stop playing. My biggest issue is that it doesn't handle like a car, nor any normal vehicle for that matter. Everything slides around likes it's on ice, regardless of what I do(did). The one feature of the game that genuinely piqued my interest was the Flashback feature, but it didn't help much to compensate for the terrible physics. It may just be me who encountered this (although I don't see how that's possible) for the short amount of time I played. And when I say short, I mean it. I only played for about 15 mins and was not left with a good impression. I was also unsatisfied with the camera in such a tight space. I'm not used to racing games, which made it even more difficult to play. Again being on those lines, there was no tutorial (that I saw) about how to play. Granted, they explained the keys to drive and the flashbacks while playing, but there were no tips for turning, stopping, elaborate roads, etc.  On the flipside, I liked the feeling given by the environment and detail put into certain things, such as the amount of damage and debris that could accumulate on the cars themselves. Again, as I mentioned earlier, I really liked the flashback feature. I haven't seen this in many games, and it gave me the ability to see how to approach specific situations from different angles (...literally). While I may not have played as long as some of the other people posting reviews, I hope anybody reading this would take very into consideration all of the goods and bads very carefully. Personally, I wasn't impressed with the game and I find it hard to see more pros than cons, so I'd say try the demo before you get anywhere near that 'buy' button."
"If there was a 'maybe' recommend option, I'd use that instead. The game isn't bad. The visuals are amazing. The car handles reasonably well (I don't care about 'realism', I care about a car I can control). Starting off was tough. I only like the occasional racing game, and I used the 'easy' difficulty (there's a very easy, a normal, and more beyond that), and there's an option to have damage to your car actually affect its handling or just show up for visual effects. While that's cool, I like easy mode, so visual effects only for me.   The game throws you into a 'big race' to start off with no training; I didn't even know what button was accelerate (it's RT on the controller). It turns out that race isn't terribly important and the following race is a test drive which actually tries to show you how to drive. That was cool. It even lets you continue the test drive after you're done - it doesn't automatically take you out of it until you're ready to leave. This made all the difference.  The game is overloaded with unnecessary unskippable cutscenes, and there's a story about getting publicity that doesn't need to be there. I couldn't work out what 'getting more fans' does. After the first couple of races, you have to set up an account etc - the whole process made me feel like I was spending more time looking at cutscenes and in the high quality menus than I was actually racing.   The racing is satisfying when you actually get to it, especially the 'rewind' feature when you press Y that lets you fix up any mistakes. This is AMAZING for a player who doesn't race often. You can see what mistakes you made and fix them. It feels like cheating and I love it. There's some sort of limit to how many times you can rewind, or an unseen cooldown or something.  The best races I liked were the 1 on 1 short races, and even the tougher ones were great thanks to rewinding. On one particular race the opponent was really beating me over and over, but I just rewound the race a couple of times and I won. The over-the-top voiceover said how good I was and how I beat them at their own game, and I was all 'ya I did'."
A good solid racing game. Not too expensive either.
"When it comes to driving games, GRID was my one and only on my PS3, so when i evolved into a PC gamer, GRID 2 was a must for me, and i must say, very happy i did it. the different classes and regions live a very simple campaign to the game keeping the focus really on the driving with a variety of race types.  8/10 - A safe way to waste a few hours each time you're bored and want a fun, simple game.  Visuals: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Immersion: 7/10 Storyline: N/A Detail: 7/10  Overall: 8/10"
"Codemasters doing what they do best and that is making racing games of course :) Codies have utilized the EGO Game Engine very well here to create jaw dropping gorgeously detailed enviroments and cars. Codies have also managed to make the cars come to life with their unique engine sounds. From monsterous V8's to 2.5L 16v, it's all there for you. From the Skyline GTR- R34 to the Mustang Mach 1, Codies have you covered. The game is geared towards the arcade style racer. I highly reccomend this game, it is definately worth the money."
"Another boring, repetitive and short-lived title from Codemasters .....Brings NOTHING new to the table. Waste of time and money."
WORST GAME EVER!   - No Drift. (in Grid2 only makes POWERSLIDE and Grid1 is authentic DRIFT) - No cockpit. (in Grid1 had cockpit). - Very easy to play against opponents. - Good graphic and good sound.(Are ones that give the positive)   We strongly advise you buy Grid1!
It's pretty cool for a quick play
"Generic Racer like any other, with tons of DLC."
"Grate game! I like multyplayer, how you can upgrade cars, only if ther wont be any DLC..."
"Sadly this sequel to what I consider to be the best racing title of the recent era has been horribly americanised (dear god I want to stab the stupid 'companion character') and has had all of the lovely freedom to pick your races from the original butchered up with a frankly dull story about some billionaire playboy fellow. I am glad I picked this up in a Humble Bundle instead of having forked out full price for this, because my contribution to charity there is probably the only good this about this game!"
"Beautiful graphics. Nice customization options for cars. Handling too arcade-y for my tastes, but fun. Cheesy forced 'storyline'. I can live with that. It's the car game way. But when I realized there was no tuning system; no parts for me to buy or tweak, I lost interest in the game. It's just not for me. But it is not a bad game."
"Oh my glob - I'm not sure whether it's just because I'm on Very Hard difficulty, but the singleplayer races are completely rigged to make the AI win in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways.  All their cars are magically faster, even if they are using the same car you have and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing I came accross, in the first promotion race where you need to overtake utility trucks without crashing to score points, even if you race super clean without a collision and overtake the other racer (the AI who I saw crash a number of times before I overtook him), the AI racer still manages to win the race with 32,000 points. It's just stupid.  I like to play on the harder difficulties in games, but I hate it when they think making it purely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is the way to go instead of giving the AI better driving skills (or whatever depending on the type of game) to make it a more realistic hardness.  It's like when they make a shooter game harder by giving the AI just a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hp, instead of making them smarter and more skilled.  Oh and also in this game, it seems if you try and ram an opponents car it smashes you instead and spins you out, but if they ram you, it smashes you and spins you out...seems fair.  I haven't played the multiplayer because I don't think anyone plays it.  I wouldn't reccommend this game if you want realism, the driving on its own is good, but the rigged AI ruin it."
"Lap a racer, i get last... 11/10 would not buy"
Pretty graphics but that's pretty much the only aspect of the game that doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste.   I'm a big fan of the predecessor of the series. However Grid 2 broke ties with the well working concept everyone liked so much. Not just the menues and unskipable cutscenes are a burden to navigate through but the courses as well are mostly generic and repetative. The choice of cars feels limited and too unbalanced and events with no prior info or overview are just a no go. Not to mention the missing cockpit view or that I've played PS1 games with better AI.   So in conclusion: If you like racing games... skip this one or at least wait for a huge discount.
"80/10. Enjoyable arcade-like racing game.  Nice graphics. Nice gameplay &amp; handling.  I found most of the game VERY easy, often lapping competitors.. Lots of DLC cars for online gameplay.."
"pros:   * graphics... in my opinion it is the peak of what a racing game needs... now they should focus in making it fun  * beautiful cars ...  cons:   * sometimes cars handle like a train.. keeps on going like corners are straight lines... no problems at all  * when in contact the slightest of touches will not allow you to move anywhere (most annoying)  * how do you gain a specific number of fans by wining races and completing objectives... makes no sense, grid one was better ... money my friend... that is what you won  * too much spectacle in the background, huge crowds... fireworks (while racing) - stupid, dangerous and pointless  * you always start from the back of the grid and have to fight the exact same people which are at the other end  * when using flashback, on the radio you get the same message, even though your flashback made that message useless, as the event he talks about on the radio is undone  verdit:   *grab it on a sale... other than that it is not worth the money... seems like an imature racing game grid 1 was far better"
"This game is a DLC milking rushed boring game. Honestly it doesn't have cockpit cam, it has very unrealistic drifting very similar to the criterion one. And you can't buy your cars you gotta win them instead. Grid 1 is a lot better compared to this."
"First if You have Raced in real Life This is a Joke !!! The Car's ram You and target You ,next You are Given a Tail Happy Car and a track that puts you sideways and your aponit beats your hind end in to the rocks it is a Beating and insalts lodgic ,if You like to race on line it is a winner as the people that own the game are good Sport and welcome You just treat it as a Game and enjoy the fun ,Shift unleashed is a better choice for Racing or GTR the choice is up to You Agravation or Good clean Racing Shift get's my vote it is Geard For Drivers not Childrin with anger probloms"
"Good game, graphics are good, but the handling of cars is a bit fake"
so hard :P
"Grid 2 is an amazing game! The online works great, the campaign is so much fun. All in all it is an amazing game!!!!!!"
Love it !! Its very unique in its own way
Not bad one of the better racing games i've played. :)
I have now downloaded GRID 2 to play for free this weekend and my girlfriend wanted to but this game for me as a gift but that is not possible because she gets a message that I own this game already. Well I dont. So she cant buy this game for me because its free to play this weekend. This is something to be awere off.
£30 for the extra cars?? really whats wrong with developers. great game but not for £60 all together. this is why people download things.  id recomend this game and recomend the developers rethink there prices and offer extras cheaper at least.
"Very fun racing game, but don't expect it to be a realistic driving experience."
+cool car damage +fun online gameplay +good graphics  -poor engine sounds -arcade oriented -high level racers are untouchable  I could recommend this game for novice racers that enjoyed late NFS series.  
"I love how this game has a reverse time button, it it very uniqe for a racing game, love it!"
"This game is really good, I love the whole WSR racing leage Fiction story it's very cool. I just WISH I can tweak my race cars suspension settings, brake bias, engine timing, boost presure.....  stuff like that"
"Sexyness Galore.     Seriously, go buy the game if you haven't already. Imagine a cinematic racing movie but you are the main actor controlling the car on a career to be the best of the best.     10/10 Sexy gameplay and visuals."
was great deal for free upgrade it to the full version gamer pad dpsnt wok any more car just turns left and its not button sticking tried to contact support sent me off somewhere that will not provide an answer do not buy this does not support gamer pad xbox 360 wired controller yomsamite you suck .fix it apple  
I pre ordered this and my excitement soon turned into frustration as I began loosing online races to the dirtiest racing lines and approaches to driving I could imagine. I would have liked a heads up as I like drifing and am quite good in previous games at that 'style' of driving.   It's as if the handbrake turns into a combo button of nitro-boost and weightlessness that you HAVE to use to win. There is absolutely no connection or feel to driving in this game. You are not in control.  Need for speed already exists...why codemasters.....why!? I feel tricked out of my money.
"Great racing game, interesting ideas, good progression and story. Game is hard, and has no cockpit view (personally I don't use that view so wasn't a factor for me), physics are great, its inbetween a sim and arcade, feels perfect to me when going from a bathtub like a charger to a import tuner the game changes and is done right IMO. Won't regret it especially with all the DLC's and if you can find it on sale its a must have."
"Back in 2007, Sega produced a game called Sega Rally Revo, developed by a studio they named Sega Racing Studio. It was a nice racing game very much in the Sega tradition, but it didn't do all that well. Codemasters does have a history of collaborating with Sega, Sega made a very nice arcade cabinet out of the original Grid, in fact. Anyway, sometime in the early 2010s, Codemasters acquired Sega Racing Studios, rebranding them Codemasters Racing and set them on this game.  Grid 1 is part of the reason normal people stopped playing racing games.  Grid 2 is the type of racing game those people would play, if they only knew what it was.  It looks realistic but doesn't feel it. It's Prototype, not Grand Theft Auto, it's Quake, not Counterstrike, it's Ace Combat, not IL-2 and it's a much better game for it. That's also part of why it doesn't sell.  Codemasters has a problem with branding. They make serious-ish games like Colin McRae Dirt, but they also make relatively silly games like Dirt: Showdown. The problem is they don't make enough effort to differentiate between these two dynamics to the consumer. Grid 2 has no winking smiley face on the cover, Grid 1 has no frowning guy on it. Grid 1 has fully modeled cockpits, Grid 2 doesn't need cockpits. Grid 1 is made so the guy who seriously bought a force feedback racing wheel for Project CARS can feel social by playing it online, Grid 2 is made for beers and game night. But nothing about Grid 2's presentation highlights any of these differences.  Early cars in Grid 2 drift easily through any corner, mid-game cars introduce you to understeer and later cars can drift a lot, but take a lot of care to do so without crashing. It's a nice difficulty curve that keeps players adapting to the cars they recieve. The tracks meanwhile get more and more bumpy, narrow and winding, with more advanced racing modes - from outrun-style checkpoint racing on a circuit to touge - getting introduced along the way. Everything is conveyed in a manner that's easy to understand, it really feels like a game, not a simulator.  And that's the thing, if you make a game with real-world cars it has to either have the words 'need for speed' in the title or be another Forza Motorsport. The fanbase expects these real-world cars to feel close enough to their real-world counterparts (but not too close, that'd be scary), including not being able to do fun things like drifting, saving your turn from going sour at the last second, or even go faster than they 'should'. I want to make it absolutely clear, there's a reason people who don't identify as 'racing game enthusiasts' don't play racing games anymore, and it started with Gran Turismo. They've become an untapped market, but just making the game isn't enough, the stigma for 'the most stagnant genre' can't just be killed with one game like Grid 2, especially when the people making actually crazy racing games have been either subverted or forced off into mobile land.  The end result is that Codemasters is forced to pander to their fanbase. Because telling people outside it when they aren't is impossible to them."
GET F**KED M8 i got this sh*t when it was free and played once next day says i have to pay for it like you wot m8 ill rek you m9
Realistic simulation!
"It's a Great Game, I Recommend it, worths its price, great quality graphics and gameplay /physics, I really dont udnerstand why so much hate and negative reviews from others. One negative is that there's not much people playing online and if you are higher level sometimes you can be get kicked often from other hosts which makes you most times go back to single player/carrier mode.  A good way is to find other skilled players to you level and send a friend request to have someone to play with. "
"A-Maz-ING!!! The best game ever! Well, not ever. Could do with a cockpit view but, meh! It's great otherwise!"
"Flipped a car twice, knocked another car into the ocean and still won.  8/10 Would recommend"
"Driving with 60km\h over a stone, flying over the enemy car and win. 10/10 Would fly again."
"I cant get past the first season, there seems to be a bug that has not been fixed for over a year. Im on the MAC by the way."
"Grid 1 was fun, this just isn´t anymore. While Grid 1 featured very contact-rich and drift-heavy races you better never touch other cars in Grid 2."
"For me, I think Grid 2 is better than Grid Autosport. The feel and gameplay especially online, make me keep going back to Grid 2 over Grid Autosport.  Just my view x"
It is a Blast
THIS GAME IS SO BAD LIKE OHMYLORD YOU CANT EVEN GO INTO COCKPIT VIEW LIKE M8 WAT. THE FIRST GRID IS A BILLION TIMES MORE GOOD. THX 4 LISTENING
No cockpit.  Awful Driving Physics.  Get Autosport.
"The online game is awful - who has the best car and high level wins. Turning a car while setting its colors made ​​me vomit. The list of players is somewhere behind the screen. Game cars are transparent and pass through each other. Steering wheel definitely better in Grid 1. During the vote maps hard to understand that the map is referring to. Nie zapisuje ustawienia sterowania. Do not write control settings. Every time when I start the game I have to do again (Darkfire Racing Wheel). I return to GRID 1 (online, tunngle)."
"Totally Recomend This to any die-hard Car fanatic. Smooth FPS on a medium to high graphics setup, and Smooth Transitions. 10/10 GRID 2 Totally Works as a competitive racing game. Also, Features many race types in the online multiplayer mode!"
its fun play it
"This game is sincerely great, gorgeous, the LiveRoutes feature is not only a success but a feature that should have been around eons ago. Fantastic car selection (the R34 Z-tune and the Caterham goofy-sounding mini Le Mans are standouts), and plenty of tracks - the touge tracks in Japan are as sparklingly gorgeous as the Dubai downtown routes. Watch out for savedata corruption however; do yourself a favor and disable Steam cloud synchronization."
"Pro: very enjoyable, many cars available (especially with DLC), easy to start with (auto-tuned difficulty), bumper view just perfect  Cons: strange physics (if you hit a car, it doesn't move while when a car hit you, pray to stay on track), lack of customization (technical parts), sometimes frustrating, external view without speed impression  While being nice to the eye, Grid2 is quite strange compared to Grid1, which managed physics rules more fairly. After 10 hours of playing, I have to admit I enjoyed this title for, let's say, 80% of the time while the remainder was full of frustrations. Where is car customization? Why do AIs have so many advantages over the 'poor' human player? Why your car does feel light as a feather whiler opponent's weights tons?  Anyway, had you played Grid1 - and liked it -, this one really worths it. Let's hope that sequels will have some improvements anyway (not tested the new one, though, I'd give it a try when I change my Hardware ;-))"
"I bought this game a few weeks after its release. I enjoyed the first Grid game and played it for hours buildingup my team and customising my cars.   The instant I started up this game, I was initially filled the excitement, wanting it to be as good as the last Grid game, but I soon lost love for this game in the first few races of playing it. Every car seemed to be set-up to drift and not actually go round corners at high speed, gripping the road. But it's far from it. I only played this game for about an hour or so. The game made me feel like the crapest driver in the world, even on easy difficulty i couldn't come close to getting first.I've played many racing games, Forza 3, Forza 4, Forza horizon, the original Grid, WRC, Colin Mcrae and so on. At least in those games io could come first even on moderate settings. Ijust couldn't get into Grid 2, so I stopped playing it.  A year later I thought that I'd give it a go again. But it was the same story again. Every car drifted, AI just drove straight into you, like they didn't even knwo that you were there.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, and I'd advise anyone to stay well clear from this game.   Dan"
"If you liked Grid, you will love Grid 2. Very cool, great graphics. Love it."
"If you liked the first, you'll like this one! But...if you already have the first, there's no need to get this one either, haha. They take away a lot from the first one. You don't buy cars any more. You just kind of...all of a sudden have the one you need for the race you're entering. It makes the cars not really feel like your own cars.  Everything else is at least as good as the first. Same awesome graphics. I think there's a few more driving assists enabled by default.... but still a very good game."
10/10
Fun to drift and stuff. And yeah.
My favorite racing game other than the Forza series. Love it though I do get annoyed with the customization.
"This game has obvious limitations (no cockpit view, scarce customization, a handling model that emphasizes drifting around corners), but if you can look past these this is a pretty decent game. The graphics are impressive, particularly in some of the city based tracks. The career mode encourages experimentation and variety (there is no need to grind for credits, as cars are given out like candy). The presentation is quite nice as well. GRID 2 is a nice game to tide racing fans over on PC until games like Project CARS and Assetto Corsa are fully finished."
This game isnt as bad as people say. Yes its more of an arcade game rather than full racing sim. I actually enjoyed this game and still play it from time to time. So buy it if you like to play racing games on the go since its optimised beautifully to play on laptops.
addictive fast action racing game
"Was hoping for a good sucessor to GRID. However, GRID 2 disappointed me with drifty and arcadey handling of the cars. So if you like racing sims, this might not be as enjoyable as GRID, if you like arcade type of games Single Player in this game might be your thing. Don't buy it for the Multiplayer part as it riddles with cheaters and trainer bots."
"i never played grid 1, so i cannot compare it to that. This game is no simulator but i throughly enjoyed the game, get it on sale tho ;) Graphics are amazing, driving physics was slightly different from what i'm use too but i thought the game and gameplay was amazing :)"
"hold on, let me drift into everything."
Crap handling of vehicles over sensitive for my liking.
Please dont waste your money on this useless not enjoyable game. Yes this game has a very good quality but the gameplay just rubbish. the developer forgot the crucial thing when developing this game which is customer happiness and satisfaction! I played this game for a few hours and I feel like i dont even want to play this game for my entire life after that. its quite ridiculous physics applied in this game. Please just dont buy something that will just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off later!
A wonderful blend of realistic mechanics meets arcade style racing! Pull off beast drifts and grips like nothing in this road to fame and glory!
"Thank god I got this on sale it's a waste of money. I thought it was going to be a much better version of the first GRID, but boy was I wrong. Everything is completly different and its not even like the same game anymore."
Good racing game. Played the first one and enjoyed that game. This game is just like the first one with some better driving mechanics and a reworked single player racing 'campaign'.
I never liked racing games before GRID 2. Very fun and the flashback system is really well-thought-out. The only thing that annoyed me was that whenever I alt-tabbed the game would mess up my graphics settings. Perfect 10/10.
"After playing RaceDriver Grid I knew I wanted Grid 2. After watching some video's of gameplay, I was skeptical. I decided to give it a try. The first 25 min almost made me stop playing altogether, luckily I pushed on.  After season 1 I fell in love with Grid 2, I could start to feel minor differences in the handling of different cars.   I really really wanted it to have a cockpit view like Grid 1, but learned to live with a different view.   I would recommend this game to Grid fans, it really is not as bad as everyone says."
Better than NFS!
No cockpit view to my dismay. For those looking for a simulator - look elsewhere. Just another pointless racing game with magical physics to ignore...unlike the first game. Should have previewed it more.
One of the best looking racing games out there
"I'm not car guy nor a fan of each year's installment of a new racing game, but I got this for free with a processor and decided to download it and give it a try. That being said, I wasn't expecting much nor did I think that I would enjoy this game, seeing as the only racing series I've ever kind of enjoyed is Burnout. After playing a few races, I thought that it looked pretty good, and that it was kind of fun, actually. I enjoyed the rewind feature, which alleviates the frustration for those who prefer to 'just drive' and are not into the driving optimally for each turn and whatnot. I also really enjoyed the way the career mode works, as it made it seem like you were an up and comer. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and did manage to beat the campaign mode. 8/10 "
Every car will drift through corners. Every car.
best racing game ever
awesome game. Cant wait for the next one to come out.
Love it
"Lots of fun to be had with Grid 2. Builds upon the original GRID and adds better physics, racing elements and features. Not to mention they listened to the community and gave the Derby DLC for FREE! Get racing!"
why miss out on this fun racer at £9.99 its a steal.
Grid is BACK and this time it's exactly the same as before only better! More tracks ....more cars more thrills more overdrift overtake smash up crashes!    Lots of racing fun to be had by all so get yourself a bargain and get Race-Man 2 i mean Grid 2. If I absolutely had to choose between cutting my fingers off and playing this i would play this maybe 8 times out of 10.
"GRID 2 is a fun racing with a lot of customization and possibilities. Instead of running a never ending campaign, GRID 2 allows you to choose what you want to do. The game is very user-friendly and it is easy to run on computers lacking 'hardcore' hardware. Definetly worth the price."
"DOES NOT HAVE A DRIVER'S SEAT CAMERA VIEW!!!!!!!  This was a dealbreaker for me, and I wish i had known before I spent the $3 or whatever this was on sale for. Other than that it is a racing game. There are cars and tracks. The game does drifting well in my opinion. From the makers of Dirt."
"Simply an amazing great experience of playing a racing game like this with a huge speed sensation while racing! the only bad thing is there isn't a cockpit unless you go for the mods...and i would love to see more tracks like London or Madrid for example...but, overall is a wonderful game you can't skip, especially if you're into racing games!"
Arcade physics and gameplay. Too unrealistic for my tastes.
"Very good, but hard game!"
"One of the best racing games I've played in a while, and I only got it for 8 bucks! I definitely recommend this one to racing fans everywhere"
Dull campaign :( ! car simulations are terrible and i drift around every corner unintentionally.
A big step backwards compared with the first Grid.  * All those city tracks are just not interesting. * Too much DLC and the base game is too little. * Handling just took a step backwards * Lacking the 'managing team' feeling from the first game. They should expand on it. Not remove it. * Artificial difficulty. Making the AI cars the equal of a Konigstiger tank while your car is a 2CV  Get it for cheap or get the first one.
Its been a while since i played the old boring racing genre. But Grid 2 with friends is fun as hell~
"Great game. The graphics, sound and gameplay all combine to give an incredibly realistic experience. The crowd cheers you on as you race by them, and overall has definitely captured my attention."
"Having also played Grid 1 to death, I'm quite baffled with the negative reviews, as it seems we're playing different games compared to my experience with Grid 2.  Firstly I have to say I'm playing with an Xbox360 controller, so I can vary the throttle on the trigger (gas pedal). The cars all handle differently (as they did in Grid 1), but where as in the first game you had to re-adjust your gamepad per car in order to tame it, in Grid 2 you simply learn the car instead.  This makes for a far more consistent experience, and one that gets you playing the game, rather than messing with the right control balance, only to have to change it for the next car.   If you play this on easy difficulty, you'll probably not get much out of it. However, turn it up to medium or higher, with Damage and you're really getting into the fun of things on your way to mastering the game, and enjoying nail biting races!  Grid 2 is far more about understanding your car, choosing the right ride for the race, and reacting to the track. There are tight time attack races with blind corners, and slopes that challenge you to rethink your breaking point, as your breaking is lighter due to the car lifting off the track a little more...it's subtle, but genious!    In one race mode the track layout changes per lap, throwing a few surprises here and there! It makes for an exilarating atmosphere with other racers breathing down your back. Some of the drivers are also deliberately aggressive! I generally try to avoid them damaging my precious paintjob!   If you're lucky enough that your name is in the audio name files, your car mechanic calls you by it during races, 'That crash looked nasty Jim!' and so on! It's a little detail that adds a personal touch.  Personal Rating: Good racing, especially on medium and higher difficulty! Great control with an xbox360 controller. Amazing Graphics and visible damage!  Score Rating: 90% - A solid driving experience!"
"I met a guy named muhammed, I smoked his ♥♥♥♥ with my subaru I rate 10/10 would buy again"
Soap simulator. 'Rewind' simulator. You can't play the game if you don't have rewind unabled. You can't NOT drift. Good game at all.
great racing game
Lemme tell ya it's a lot of driving.
I can wreck my car as much as I want and my insurance doesn't rise. 11/10
This Game Is Amazing You Can Turn The Time If U Have A Difficult On the race
"I have been a huge fan of Grid 1 and in general love racing games, keeping that in mind i have to say I have had a blast and alot of fun playingthis game, yes it might not have cok-pit view and the cars may not drive like a simulator but who cares as long as it gives you a challenge and fun, which a lot of games fail to do. It is a must own and take my word for it you will love it. If you want a sim get forza or gran turismo which arent as fun as blasting down the road at 200mph and drifting past rivals :)"
Awsome game ! :D
Cool game.
"This game is called GRID 2, but I think, its like new game! GRID was really nice game, the cars and physics, same like graphics was good! Now, when I play GRID 2, I have question - this is next game of GRID? NOOOOO!!!! its new race game! Hard to find multiplayer servers - so  Good grapichs, Nice cars, good race game - BUT NO GRID!!  7/10... ;/"
it's good but i hit the space to drift but s is brake 
I have only played for about 10 minutes but this game is awesome looking. Definetly worth the money.
Grid 2 is a huge improvement from the original game.
"A big disappointment.  I enjoyed GRID a lot, so naturally thought its sequel would bring me joy too. Unfortunately and after giving it much of a chance, I really don't enjoy GRID 2. The fact everything is about 'drifting', even the non-drifting events. The handling is pretty off compared to realistic racers, and is pretty stupid compared to other arcade racers so I'm not sure where it's supposed to fit in.   Obviously all the dull 'city' tracks are not realistic, and some of the modes such as 'Endurance' which basically changes the layout of the track as you drive around (to try and prevent you learning it, but the AI know exactly what to expect) are unrealistic, as well as the whole WSR concept.  The only real positive I had from the game was that the multiplayer was entertaining in the beginning, and compared to other CM games such as DiRT and the F1 series, as least you weren't forced as much to watch useless scenes/forced into a race before you'd even set up your controls/graphics etc..  I'd try GRID Autosport as apparently that is the resolution to this poor game, but the series has left me with a bitter taste."
"This game is becoming on of the best racer games! Why, because Codemasters listen to what their gamers want and incorporate it into the game. Keep up with this great racing series."
"Excellent racing sim, fun for anyone who just likes driving games right up to serious racers. I highly recommend this game."
"Awesome game, I can really reccomend it."
" GET GRID (original) INSTEAD  2/5 stars. The first game GRID, is a 5/5! This is a obvious downgrade in the fun factor.   To my friend who bought me this game, thank you ever so much.  To the developers of this game, WTF!!!!?   It's a racing game. You get cool cars and you race. But its the game play that made this great franchise fall. I'll explain that in a second. First the big talking points.  Graphics: Very cool, and always have been.  Have they been upgraded from the last game?  Hard to tell, probably not.  Are there more cars? SO MANY CARS!!!!1  New tracks? New tracks and new race types!   Then why don't you love it like the first GRID?   They changed the game play. Two key things that gave the first game soul that are missing from this corpse.    Driving features  You can still drive fast but not furiously! What i LOVED about GRID was I could be a bully! I could be more ruthless then tony stewart and not actually kill someone (too soon?) Really though, I could push the main competitors car into a barrier and they would be out of the race. I LOVED THAT! Every one of my races would start with 12 cars or so and it would end with 7.    This game does not have that, in fact it's the exact opposite!  A heavy american muscle car (driven by you) can and will be bullied and pushed around by a light weight nissan in this game. Even if you fight back? Especially if you fight back. Its a sad sight. *shaking my head*     Crew/HUD features  The first game had a really nice feature as I drove and my car got damaged. It would tell me what was damaged (left front wheel, or whatever else) This game just simply tells you your car has sustained damage. . . well i just ran into a wall. So, yeah!!!  WTF is damaged and how badly is it damaged!!! You could tell me in the first game, why not the second!?  "
It's a good game!
"a GREAT replacement for GRID 1. Here's the trouble with it. After a few rounds you get to a point where you simply cannot progress through the Career Stage, because in cars provided in Game have too little grip, or stability to complete the challenges. THus you are forced to purschase more CARS to win. So after paying for the Game - to be confronted with IN GAME PURCHASING, and a 'pay to win' situation, the game ends up being a huge disappointment. SO if you like to spend money to win , this games is for you."
"Not as good as the original, this one is far more arcadey, just doesn't feel that good to drive in. This is the game that made me think 'I don't think I'll pre-order a game ever again'"
Good game. It is NVIDIA VISION ready and looks beautiful in 3D even with postprocessing on. I recommend this game for any car racing fan out there.
"love this racing game ,one of the best i have played"
Wow Great. i fun a lot.
Great game
"If you want an intense, drifting, arcadesque racing game this game takes the cake and eats it too. From Fast and Furious inner-city street races, to the Initial D Mountain Passes and even traditional track races. The variety of cars is great and they are all fun to drive. This may not be simulation but its a hellava lot more exciting to break realistic racing limitations. Easily one of my top favorite games.  9/10 needed eurobeat soundtrack"
"Sweet rides, Online fun. You don't wanna miss out on the action if you're a fan of racing games."
"This game can be fun to play, but overall, I've found it to be a waste of my time. The big gripe I have about GRID 2 surrounds the difficulty settings. NORMAL is too easy for me (I win every race), but when I move it up to HARD, there are races that are virtually impossible to win. 95% of the time, I start in the back third of the grid at the beginning of the race (in 200+ races, I’ve started on the front row ONCE, and I believe it’s the only time I’ve started in the front two rows), and by the time I fight my way through the traffic into 2nd place, the guy in 1st (who almost always started on the front row) is 5-10 seconds ahead of me. I normally race well enough to gain on him, but that huge lead he gets off the front row (while you are being held up by the rest of the field) is insurmountable, because he never makes a mistake. This is especially the case in the coastal/mountain races (point-to-point vs. circuit). I also find a few of the vehicle challenges to be too difficult on HARD. I wouldn’t have too much of a problem with it if you could fail on one vehicle challenge and move on to the next, but say you have three challenges and you can’t get past the first one – you can’t move on to the other two. A new vehicle challenge doesn’t become available to run until you’ve passed the one before it. So you could end up missing out on multiple cars, because you can’t get past one challenge. If you could choose each challenge individually, that would solve the issue as far as I’m concerned. I’d miss out on some cars because I couldn’t earn them (or didn’t want to waste two hours trying to get a perfect run in), but at least I wouldn’t be missing out on cars that had nothing to do with the challenge I couldn’t pass."
"As long as you know your buying an arcade racer there is good fun to be had in this game, no need to talk about Physics, Mechanics ect. it's an arcade racer you can do silly things you cant do in a real car but it's a good arcade racer, iv'e had a lot of fun in single player getting to the top of friends leaderboards and good fun racing onling, the game has nice graphics and smooth controls, overall a good game."
love racing game
"For those that love racing games for the beautiful sweeping courses, the high intensity crash evasions, and gorgeous cars customized in your own livery, you can't do much better than this. The replay system is, as in the first one, very fun and easy to use, with an additional feature of easily being able to upload videos to YouTube.  There are a couple flaws with the game, such as the limited choices of camera views during replays and some strange option restrictions (lowest volume 50%? huh?), but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Grid 1 was fun, this just isn´t anymore. While Grid 1 featured very contact-rich and drift-heavy races you better never touch other cars in Grid 2."
"For me, I think Grid 2 is better than Grid Autosport. The feel and gameplay especially online, make me keep going back to Grid 2 over Grid Autosport.  Just my view x"
love this game but i wish that the controls were more easy :) 
now i remember why i uninstalled this  the steering is godawful and so are the brakes.
"It's a game about time machines, fast, beautiful(and sometimes crappy) time machines."
"Very nice racing game made for PC! This game is one of those games where you except tons of good game quality and this game does it with style! You have exellent keyboard steering as well, so if you dont have steering wheel, dont worry this is easy with keyboard too. I recommend this game to anyone motorhead because its unique experience what you get while playing this game, I'm giving this game 10/10. BUY THIS GAME NOW!"
"totally ♥♥♥♥ game in my life, i better spend more cash for need for speed, bad setting , the car is totally bad.  i quit this game in 0.4 hours , thanks god .... i spend money for ♥♥♥♥"
"You'd be better off getting the original GRID. You know, the one that DID win the awards and sold couple million copies.  This one is basically the same as the original, only worse. You do the same thing but are given less options, less real world tracks less cars and shorter races. Seriously. Half the races your career consists of have ONE lap. ONE. Driving assists are always on with no option to disable them makes the game pretty easy for anyone familiar with racing games. It's no longer 'almost a racing sim' where you can still turn assists on and have fun with it. You're only getting the 'arcade' experience. Even on the highest difficulty I had no trouble winning races. Unless it's a one lap race that you start from last place - good luck with that. Only new and interesting mode is the 'Overtake' but it's ruined by the AI obviously being awarded way more points that you can earn yourself unless you have an absolutely perfect run. I understand AI needs to cheat sometimes but at least don't do it in front of my eyes. Other modes have been dumbed down. Drift now consists of you making a SINGLE run down like 3-4 turns on one of the regular tracks, which are completely not meant for that, while your driving assists are still on. No skill is required. It's a joke basically. Also no 24h Le Mans or 20-something car races. 6 cars max, short tracks, 1-2 laps each. "
"So I am playing the game on the free weekend and I think it's 'ok', if you have never played Grid just buy part 1, why?  Well part 1 has much more customizable controls and the joystick on the computer controllers or the d-pad is not so sensitive. From the very first race on the Mustang you feel way too sensitive to be driving, it is not realistic. Ok so it's an arcade type racer so where's my sensitivity bar? No slider bar in the options means you're stuck with what you got.   Overall it is an ok game but I am dissapointed. The biggest flaw is not being able to tailor the sensitivity on my controller. It is probably better on console anyway. I'll pass on this one.   3 out of 5. Average.   p.s.  The story is ok and interesting, it's a different game than part 1. Just buy part 1."
"Not a bad game, I worked out that by editing a file in the game directory it's possible to enable those Intel only FX on any PC. Overall well worth the $8 while it's on sale."
Almost bought this before...thank god i didnt....first thing i expect from games that have duel option is the possibility to knock competion out...not hit a brick wall....its a brick wall game...pretty but sad game.
Great game!!  Driving a american muscle at 250km/h in Miami.  Love it.
Played a bit during free weekend. Only redeeming thing I can really say about the game is at least you get to start with a Mustang and not the other embarassing cars in the game. This game should come with a disclaimer that it is almost unplayable without a controller. The handling of the cars is so wallowy and numb that you'd think you were on a boat. You have to sit through a lot of garbage that you can't skip and the voice acting/story component is poorly executed and probably even more poorly thought out. A racing game should be about racing and driving well. The idea of rewinding is pathetic and is out of place. So you cooked a corner? Okay rewind until you get to a point where you were going straight long enough to jump back in and retake the wheel. I wasted too much time writing this. If you are looking at this game and get to the end of this review you too have spent too long considering if this is worth any more of your time.
So pleasant and fun!
"For a PC racing game, this game sure does the job. There are some things i personally didn't like, for wxample the cars are really drifty and pretty slippert too, and there is not a big selection of tracks to choose from, and it takes YEARS to find a game online. Though for an arcade racing game as it is, it's really good. Great graphics, too. So if you don't have an Xbox with Forza, i'll recommend this game to you."
Nice product. Can't imagine that if we are really in this game. Must be so many wrecks!!
this game is suc kssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
One of the best racing games on pc :) 
Awesome game. I like that they fixed the physics from the first game and that the handbrake isn't as ♥♥♥♥ed up as it was in the first game.
Best game ever m8. u have 2 play it
"This game looks realy good! And we all know the old grid so i had the change to try it out during this free weekend. First of all im a huge race fan , specialy when there is american muscle cars involved. Favorite stil remains for project gotham racing.  Anyways Grid 2 , my first impression. Story mode = not a challenge , had to set it in on highest difficulty to had some minor sort of challenge. This is personal but if your looking for a challenging race game with a realistic feeling but arcade gameplay, Grid 2 is too easy. So i went on and tried online mode after i got bored doing story line.  Online mode a total destruction derby, its a matter of who gets ahead of the ramming pack and can take a lead to stay safe from others ramming you off the road.  In the end online was more challenging but didnt evolve enough racing for me. Overall this game is rated not challenging enough, and this comes from a guy who is stil a huge fan of the Project Gotham racing series.   I have yet to find a worthy follow up for my PG series and Grid 2 is certainly not worthy enough for this. Al i can say this game could be enjoyed by those not so good in racing, dont buy it for online mode! but for the story in a simple easy challenged campaign to enjoy.   But for me its a big No no Thanks for reading, but keep in mind this is my personal opinion as a fan from Realism-looking mixed with arcade gameplay. "
A simplistic but fun racing game. Not one for hardcore racing fans but if if you want an easy (and cheap!) introduction to modern racing games this seems the way to go
One of the best racing game after need for speed most wanted (2005) :D
this is the best game in the world  
"GRID 2 manages to inject a nice dose of realistic physics within an arcade style racing game. The result is a game that simulator purists will surely frown upon.... (lack of view, no tuning) but everyone else will enjoy. The locations and cars look absolutely stunning. The single player is meaty and the multiplayer is absolutely worth playing."
"Pros: better graphics and more cars than grid 1  Cons: cant modify cars in career mode, more of NFS racing style than racing simulator.  Overall: 7.5/10"
really fun but kinda unrealistic
Very fun and easy to play!
"Ever since I left my xbox 360, I've been looking for a racing game to replace the Forza Motorsport series. This one comes very close."
A racing game with a lot of tracks and a good amount of cars (though more are added by DLCs). Controls are arcade. No cockpit camera view is available.   8/10
My steam user is drasticrave Add me up for multiplayer? This is getting really boring. I'm from Singapore.
"Enjoyed Need For Speed: SHIFT? Hate EA?  Get this game.  I admit not the best, although I am enjoying the game thus far."
"Meh, missing the European races. I'm not interested in American racing."
Racing on ice O_o
"Love the game, wide variety of customizations color-wise!  The cars already look nice, and still, you may tweak the tires a bit :D. Just started the game but will look forward to driving the Chevy #AMC Just also bought the game on free weekend!  VROOM VROOM!"
great game
"It was horribly frustrating at first, but after a bit of play time it is okay. There are still a few issues that annoy me and I'm not quite sold on it, but it has great potential. I am still not sure it is worth even $7.50 on this sale so I am just going to wait for a bigger sale perhaps if it is less than $5 with the DLC I can justify it"
"Allright First seems like you dont need skills to drive ! Graphics 8/10 Driving 6/10 Sounds effect 6/10 There's no varieties of cars to choose, unless u want to pay for all the DLC's Customize vehicles SUCK So you get bored really Fast! 8 dollars not worth it!"
"It's fun online. A lot of fun.  Though it feels there isnt many tracks to drive on.  And well, no cockpit view. Pity.  A good game overall if you have friends to play with."
"Got two events in and it gets stuck in repeat... beat the race, select continue, same race... and repeat... Typical arcade physics, great if you're the age yoru still living at home. If your a sim racer its pretty forgetful dead feeling arcade racing."
"10/10 For all you who enjoy racing around, drifting around tight corners, and best of all. Undoing your mistakes!"

"Over the last few hours of playing this game I have seesaw-ed over if this game is worth buying and putting hours into, and to that I have to say no. Now the reasons behind that are not so clear, I have been playing racing games on PC for at least 15+ years and this one game stands out in its mediocrity.  The physics for many cars are decent enough but drifting is over used and on some cars leads to out right loss of control, also at least in my experience using the handbrake is ill-advised. Unless you drive very carefully you can expect to hit the wall often usually due to the fact that if you brake you drift and if you drift you are not bleeding speed fast enough thus sending you off of your line and into the wall.  I can say that some of my impacts were actually quite entertaining from various spin outs only to face the right direction to my favorite 100ft+ barrel roll and landing on all 4 wheels will little loss of speed, in true James Bond style.  With the nuts and bolts of the cars there is no customization beyond the paint job which will leave anyone more used to the last handful of Need for Speed games of the last 10 years with a sense of 'Why bother?'. With no upgrades or even basic tuning you loose the sense of accomplishment of pushing your old Mach 1 Mustang to the limit to beat out the newest BMW M3's though perfect knowledge of both tuning your car to the track and driving style.  Now so far in this review I have bashed the game fairly hard in all the same places that many reviews here do, but there are a few things that this game has that I can only wish could be used in other games and other things that the game just plain does well.  The idea of building bit by bit a fanbase and bouncing from sponsor to sponsor as they demand things that you know won't happen is very appealing and I believe adds a LOT to the emersion of the game. The other side of this is you put in your name and see IT in the cutscenes and hear the nickname that you selected instead of hearing 'Ryan Cooper' a billion times, it really is refreshing to hear and again lends greater emersion of the driver.  Another thing often overlooked is how the menus behave especially in the middle of the race. What I am talking about is probably the best done race restart sequence I have ever seen. In most games you hit Esc&gt;Restart&gt;*Scroll up/down*&gt;Restart/Yes and then it restarts the race.  Now having to do this process everytime you need to restart a close race because you caught the last turn wrong or the like that extra step of scolling and often the extra second or two of time needed to load that menu even on a powerful computer, can mean the difference between quiting the game for a while or pushing through one more time.  Grid 2 you hit restart and even before the menu is fully loaded you hit restart again and it restarts the race in a fraction of the time of other titles.  The above is really all that can be squeezed out of this game because its not bad and it is NOT an ugly game but it is lacking in the places that these games need most. If this game where $0.99 to no more than $4.99 on the upper most end then I would consider buying the game maybe."
Great Challenge! Set it on hard Difficulty.
Nice game :D
"I like this game. I really do. It feels arcade, but it's not that easy to play even on the easiest difficulty. Lots of cars, customisations, tracks and stuff. It really is a great release, although it's not as good as the first GRID. Still, I recommend it without hesitation."
Tabbing out of the game causes it to become windowed.
"I'm not the type of person to write reviews even if I dislike something but I felt compelled to write a review about this game specifically because it was such a big disappointment. The graphics have not improved since the first game and there were any I did not notice them. I played GRID 1 right after GRID 2 and had a much better time with the first installment. The handling of the cars felt more real. I just couldn't get into GRID 2 no matter how hard I tried. There's just something about it that lacks the true essence of a racing game and it feels like I'm playing a game made for a 10 year old on a console system. If you want a great racing game, this isn't it. I'd rather spend more money on the FIRST one than dump money on this game even when its on sale.  Total disappointment coming from somebody who's played PC racing games for 20 years..."
"this game goes from fun racing to road rage simulator  the camera is HORRIBLE WHY do game developers always put the camera RIGHT BEHIND the car? if i'm driving a car, wouldn't it be a good idea if I could see what was in front of me? no, instead they put it right there. you can change the camera angle, but it only causes it to go from 'car blocking your view' to 'car slightly down but still blocking most of your view'.  there are so many unskippable parts that exist for no reason  all the other cars can easily pit maneuver you and make your car go out of control but you can't do the same to them  the cars constantly block you and ram into you it's so irritating, avoiding them is next to impossible"
"If you want a racing game, this is for you. There are parts of the circuit that's really hard to turn at but that makes it even more fun. Be ready to be at the edge of your seats when you start this game."
"i started to play that game i can say it was indeed fun play with but unfortunately, i hate to said it but there is one problem : WHAT HAPPEN TO THESE SUBTITTLES ?! did you know that there are deaf players who are willing to play that sort of game... :|  so, i will give it a BIG no for me. i did uninstalled this game since it was a free weekend game."
Such a gigantic let down when compared to the first.
"For those wanting a racing simulator, steer clear. Those who like arcade style fun racing (similar to the Need for Speed's) then this is good fun.  Only recommend this game on a good sale though for one major reason, BULK DLCs. The game itself is good value if purchas for sub $10 region. But there are so many DLCs to be had and none are good value. One track and two cars? Pfft. No thanks. All The DLCs will cost you more than twice what the game costs and do not have more than twice the available content.  Oh and if you don't buy the DLCs, you will be annoyed slighty often as the game 'offers' the DLC cars for use on tracks in the campaign that when selected, which it seems like you can select by the way, will send you to the store page. Annoying.  Game as a standalone is fun and great value on sale. To me, at no point was it saying it was a simulator so that wasn't a disappiontment. If you just want a racer that isn't focused on realism and just allows you to have go and enjoy it then this is a fine game. My only problems with this game is the DLC 'pushing' it does and the prices expected for said DLCs. Brilliant with a big TV a controller and good sound system turned up loud!  7.5/10 - Great arcade racer for fun if on sale, can't see the value in DLCs."
"Some people may think this game is a simulator... they would be wrong. It's more of an arcade racer and a fun one at that. When using a good steering wheel, this game is loads of fun. It does require some effort on your part to win races and is not a complete cake walk. Some of those races are long. It is however far easier than a simulator: ie - rFactor, or as my friends and I refer to it, Ice Factor. If you are looking for a fun game which wont leave armature racers flustered, this is for you! If you're a purist racer, look elsewhere."
"Camera angles can be annoying Too slow to load When customizing the car, the car changes instantly, however I'm stuck with a view of it's bonnet! Quite annoying. Flipping between customizing and the car preview is not a good way of doing it, especially with todays impatient culture. :) Graphics are really good. Commentary is very good."
"This is my first racing game on PC and it's surprisingly good. Normally I playing racing cames on PS3 &amp; 4. This was a bit too easy with the rewind functionality, but it's optional to use it :)"
"i Was Surprised This Wasn't What I Call A Sim Racing Game. I Was Impressed by the type &amp; variety of cars&amp; that the tracks change on the fly during certain type races. Plus I like the customization.Certainly a game I might buy this weekend if the price is right,"
"First of all, I'd like to say, that I've played numerous of racing games like Gran Turismo 2, TDU 1 and 2, classic NFS games and plenty of others. I don't need more-than-real simulators, but I like games where I can enjoy cars and driving.  I've been looking for some racing game with nice realism-to-fun ratio for some time now. Also tried Burnout paradise, that I got from some bundle. That game was bad, seriously bad (using brakes was more like enabling some 'Drift mode').   But how about GRID 2 ?"
"Online Mode lots of kidz killing gameplay: you do a nice race but they ram you in the last turn before the finish. at every start from the grid you have to pray the lord to not end into a wreckage of cars smashing each other. sometimes i found myself ending 3rd (?) after being 1st and passed at the last turn by only ONE car, maybe the other was flying or in invisible mode (?) (or was I blind tired)  apart from that graphics and sound are ok, some lag during race but not too heavy. another thing, you cannot select a favorite car for racing with, since it's the group/room leader who choose the car category. He could change while in the lobby and you found you choosing a car from another category before starting race. This is very annoying. Single Player? Who cares, I have Grid 1 which is yet ok for SP. Thanks for the opportunity to play for free with this, now I'm sure I will not buy it. Bye"
fun racing game. you aint about this life
"I tried this game during steam's free to play weekend weekend and had the least amount of fun that I've ever had playing a racing game. The cars handle like the track has been greased, the physics are wonky, and the game overall is just not enjoyable. I'm a huge fan of the racing genre, and even though I'm not great at racing games most of them at least manage to be entertaining, this one was just bad."
exellent game runs on my gtx 850m at 61 to 62 + fps
"Too bad, doesn't support driving wheel and joystick, I am out."
Crashes with NVIDIA ...just like the last version.
:)
"I got the game for free to play on my PC for the entire weekend I that this was posted during,  I had it on ps3, and the game was hard and frustrating, even with my G27 wheel.  So I installed this, in hope that it would be better and worth getting.  But it isn't.  It is hard and frustrating, with hard to master handling combined with realistic AI that goes the same speed you are going that are hard to catch up with, which is good, but combined with absolutely awful handling, even on VERY EASY the game is still incredibly hard to master, or at least become somewhat good at it and be able to easily beat your first race in first place every time you race.  The game has an entire damage engine that works well, and an absolutely BEAUTIFUL graphics engine, and everything is simply amazing in this game.  However, the handling ruined it all for me and a LOT of others too.  Anyway, giving more detail, the game is focused on drifting, But the horrible handling, comes when you try to drift. You are more than likely to lose control, so you'll most likely lose any race.  It really is sad that the handling ruined this masterpiece, it really is.  I'm going to give it a 7/10, for the amazing game it is, except 3 points off for that handling.  Some might disagree with me, so if you are one of them, don't comment on the post complaining that I just suck, because a whole bunch of other people hate the handling too."
"i never played the first game. Handling is nice in this, I enjoyed the challenge, some say the tyres felt like they were sliding on butter, but I think it's fine, more realistic..only problem I had was, because I use a g27 steering wheel, the gear shifting can be a little off, I play WRC and that involves quick speed shifts and they are a lot smoother.. Not sure whats wrong but Grid doesn't seem to read the shifts that well..I'm useto doing quick shifts but the game just puts it into neutral most of the time making me slow down and when I try to re-adjust the gear it just sticks in neutral, which can be frustrating..though can always go back to using the keyboard but thats no fun. However I did only play like 1 hour of this so..im not completely hating. Oh and whatever happened to cockpit view..?"
"Neat little arcade racer. If you're into this kind of stuff, get it."

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun
EDIT: former negative review due to game cost and online playability.    Game seems to have been fixed and is a much more reasonable price. Well worth youre money.
Physics and sound are awesome!
This game is way too hard. I played on very easy mode and still came in last place each time on the very first level. The car seems really hard to control. It is constantly skidding out of control even at low speeds. I guess if you are really dedicated you can probably get good at it but I did not have the patience.
"While the first GRID was an amazing, diverse experience, this one plain sucks. They have 3 tracks. boring as hell. no alternate car views. epitome of garbage"
"Probably the best paced racing game of all time. Most games start out where you either pass licenses, or like this one where you race with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car at first. The difference is most games go on from there as a 'Then do whatever' after your first race. GRID 2, however, takes you on a journey as a sports car driver. Reminescent of the days of Porsche Unleashed, you're a driver that needs to be competitively aggressive to promote a world racing event. You go out of your way to challenge drivers from all over the world in an attempt to get the most amount of publicity possible, so more and more people go to the racing league, and more fans pay for the show.  This game has the BEST racing game mechanic I've ever seen called 'Flashback'. You have the option to reverse time on a limited basis if you royaly screw yourself over. This is very awesome with the race variety where you can't see the map and the road not set in stone, it's different and goes on differently for as long as the timer is up. So you have a pretty good chance of miscalculating a few turns and NEED another option other than 'Restart the Race'. In easier difficulties this can also be used to your racing advantage, Went left and got cut off? Rewind, go right! The cars aren't plenty, but provide enough variety for me to not complain and I'm used to Gran Turismo. The cars handle differently, and weight+power+accel+top speed are the only statistics that matter, and they make an actual impact as each car I've played handles differently. Cutely enough though, they made every car as if top of the line engineers built them, so american cars are in the same playing field as the rest and don't handle/perform like a fat 50 year old with erectile dysfunction as they do in real life. The game also doesn't corner assist as invasively as other games do. You feel like you made the turn in your own right and not just because a turn was coming up and you pressed the turn button. It's hard to describe, but seriously it's a really great cornering system with a lot of variety in turns, almost a strategy system to it. The game provides optional multiplayer, but also compares your times with friends if you're in career mode. It doesn't destroy your privacy like some up-and-coming racing games.  The maps are very awesome, from top tracks of the world to awesome highways you may have seen. The roads have been widened though, to accomodate for high speed driving, unlike other games where there is no sense of thrill. Difficulty is handled VERY well in this game. Drivers in 2nd and 1st drive like maniacs so you have to earn the position even in the easiest difficulty it adapts to your playstyle/driving and slows down cars infront to still provide an advantage. (IE crash more, they will go slower, but clever enough so you can't wall ride past everyone). The cars behind you will drive aggressively unless you're in first in easier difficulties, after you achieve first and outmaneuver the competition they will not likely catch up anytime soon unless you REALLY mess up. The variety of events is pretty awesome. Not just a racer. There are drift events, passing events, elimination events(if you're familiar with burnout series), timed trials of course, and pole catching. The only complaint I have is that I thought the story would go dark somewhere in career, but it didn't. It's fine that it didn't, it would have been kinda weird if it did, but would have made it super interesting. That's just personal though and in no means something people would want other than freaks like me, lol. Most people are perfectly fine with racing being the only exciting part. Not saying completing the story wasn't exciting, but it was very predictable, so less exciting than if it took a turn where you had no idea what the crap would happen.  Thanks for reading my review!"
its very arcade like and also the demolition pack thats free wont download for me
"While I enjoyed the first Grid, it ended up feeling repetitive after awhile and the physics were just far too realistic to actually have fun. I found Grid 2 to be an excellent blend of arcade and realistic racing. There are tons of cars, tons of tracks and all that great Codemasters style. Great racing game!"
"not meant to be played with a keyboard. every game, i crashed into ditch or something and my car flew into a river like the Dukes of Hazard gone wrong. every time u hit a turn button its OMG TURN LEFT SO MUCH ALL WAY RIGHT NOW!!!! even if it's only a slight curve. Your car turns like it had to go to the bathroom and you wouldn't let it. so its impossible to drive perfectly without a controller with a stick you can push gradually."
Great game! I really do recomend it
"I think Grid 2 is a really good racing game with tight corners and epic drifting. However with all racing games rthere are some flaws but there arent't many, one big flaw for me is no incar view because that really makes the game better ion many ways. Also with almost all PC racing games you'll need a controller if you want your steering to be smooth and not spin out on almost every corner."
Awesome racing game! P.S. It's true:P
"Really annoying. One of those games where you have to do all sorts of nonsense besides actually play, and the gameplay was not my style when it did actually let me play."
No reseemblance to what made Grid such an enjoyable game.
"A very well made racing game, tons of fun. Can't wait to get the full game so I can play the derby mode (I currently have only played the free weekend, and it was amazing :D) "
"Great, smooth and fun controlling racing game if you don't mind:  - Having no internal/cockpit view. - Not being able to race a season for points across all tracks. - Selecting a track based on some vague text title and photo. - Having to play the career mode with it's constant narration about how great you are and it's many 'fun' challenges and irrelevant activities just to unlock all the cars. - Racing across boring, enclosed, mostly flat, city tracks that are overly busy with crowds and scenery, while constantly covered in a perpetual cloud of brown nuclear fallout-like pollution that has left the world in a state of constant twilight, apparently preventing the existence of any vivid colours."
So much fun! OMG
"sweet game, at first was very hard to control the vehicles, but once you get the hang of it, its amazing"
""
"DO YOU LIKE BURNOUT 2, BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU GET A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FACSIMILE OF BURNOUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING BURNOUT."
"Excellent game, but THE WORST user interface I have EVER seen"
"Good, but needs to be on steamos "
+Great Gfx +Well made car models that you can also customize +Detailed damage engine  -Unrealistic handling of cars   Conclusion:Worth it for casual fun
"Good Graphics and Good Handling, Goodjob guys... Please another sequel for this game... :) "
I love it.
"Have been looking at this for a while but the negative reviews put me off. As it was free to try for the weekend and a reduced price too i thought i would try it for the weekend. That's where my excitement ended though. I felt the handling of the cars in game was so bad that it was unplayable. On the note of it being unplayable, it also crashed straight out to the desktop several times, then the final straw was when my steering wheel went hard right all on it's own and my pc totally locked up with nothing but a mouse pointer on a black screen. The only way of getting out of it was the reset button. If you want a game that you can play then DO NOT bother getting this one."
"I haven't logged many hours kn this game but you get hooked very early on. There are many reviews claiming that you're forced to drift on every turn. That is not at all true. GRID 2 does require some prior knowledge to driving to successfully race without crashing, spinning out, etc. The mechanics as well as physics in this title are on point. I've only came upon one issue but aftree researching, it's not very common and the support team is currently working with me to fix the issue. All in all, GRID 2 is a great addition to anybodys library. Great gameplay + great support, what's better? Whether you get it for the discounted price of $7.49 or the full price of $29.99, you will not regret a single penny.  Rating: 9.5/10"
"The good: -Good graphics -Good tracks -Decent sound -Good controls  The alright: -DLC loaded  The bad: -Too much drifting  Overall, good game"
now thats it unfreed it wont work it just pops up a update news and doesnt play &gt;:(
"awesome game, fun driffting too"
"Nice game, good graphics. Good game all round I would recommend to anyone"
One of the best racing games ever.
Great game.
Good quality but no cockpit view is annoying. Could be fixed with the many mods though that do work on multiplayer.
such a cool racing game.. love to wreck another racing player lol Best Game Ever i hope i could make my own character/driver that would be awesome
I had every intention on purchasing this game after playing it for free. DIdn`t realise £4.99 price was only during the weekend. ♥♥♥♥ biscuits! 
Love this game. Graphics are unreal.
"Do you know at least slightiest bit about driving and physics involved ? Yes ? So run away from this game.  Do you like a lot of efects and smoke? Don't care about action and reaction? Do you think that if two cars hit each other it is always yours that crashes regardless of the car weights? So buy this game and enjoy.  Nice game for casual driver, piece of cr... for real driver. Choose yourself. Sometimes enjoyable, sometimes annoying...  I clicked not recomend, but just because I was forced to. The game is not rally bad and not really good. Choice is yours based on answers to first paragraph questions."
"Greatest racing game ive played in a while. Will deff be picking up Grid- Autosport. Amazing graphics, great performance, many cars to choose and win, plenty of tracks, plenty of different events to keep it fresh and exciting, good paint and sponsor features. Much gameplay and tons of racing fun to be made. The way cars drive, the way speed feels, the drifting...this game does a stupendous job at executing good racing with some fun destruction and a competitive touch by giving it a DGAF attitude with smashing cars and beating your way to first! A good buy."
plays like the first and beautiful to watch
"The game is excellent, the graphics are amazing and sound is brilliant, driving a BMW through a tunnel sounds truly magnificent and the scenery is really beautiful, whilst you're racing down a cross country road you can't help but be left speechless, it is a truly gorgeous game"
Awsome racing game for all who are looking for some casual racing action with lot´s of nice cars.
"Beautiful graphics, good to great driving physics, decent representations of the real-world tracks. For the smoothest play, grab a controller"
"says free weekend , but ended sooner than it was to"
This game is the best racing game i have ever played in a long time. It is so fun to play and so fun to drift round all the different tracks in this game. If you are not good at drifting then thats fine because you dont have to thats the good part you can drive how you like. Also the grafics of the game is fernominal. The only game better than this is FH2 but you cant get that game on steam so this game is the best racing game on steam.... I just cant wait for grid 3.
"Still my favorite racing game of all time, gonna have to buy it soon :D"
It's good.
I love it. I need to get used to the controls and everything though...
Tap S to drift
"Went fast. Drove car up a rock wall, shot off the rock wall, flew off cliff. Lost race. 10/10"
"I am not very in to racing games beacuse i don't like them,but this game grabbed my attention and i really recommend it!"
"A fun racer if you like straight up racing. events are varied and the game is challenging. if you like raceing oriented driving games, this is for you, no open world or cops for all you Need for speed fans though."
Nice arcade racer. i dont like codemasters career modes so much because you change car too often. I like to keep 1 car and make it good xD but ok career nonetheless =)
"Beautiful graphics. Nice customization options for cars. Handling too arcade-y for my tastes, but fun. Cheesy forced 'storyline'. I can live with that. It's the car game way. But when I realized there was no tuning system; no parts for me to buy or tweak, I lost interest in the game. It's just not for me. But it is not a bad game."
"Oh my glob - I'm not sure whether it's just because I'm on Very Hard difficulty, but the singleplayer races are completely rigged to make the AI win in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways.  All their cars are magically faster, even if they are using the same car you have and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing I came accross, in the first promotion race where you need to overtake utility trucks without crashing to score points, even if you race super clean without a collision and overtake the other racer (the AI who I saw crash a number of times before I overtook him), the AI racer still manages to win the race with 32,000 points. It's just stupid.  I like to play on the harder difficulties in games, but I hate it when they think making it purely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is the way to go instead of giving the AI better driving skills (or whatever depending on the type of game) to make it a more realistic hardness.  It's like when they make a shooter game harder by giving the AI just a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hp, instead of making them smarter and more skilled.  Oh and also in this game, it seems if you try and ram an opponents car it smashes you instead and spins you out, but if they ram you, it smashes you and spins you out...seems fair.  I haven't played the multiplayer because I don't think anyone plays it.  I wouldn't reccommend this game if you want realism, the driving on its own is good, but the rigged AI ruin it."
"Lap a racer, i get last... 11/10 would not buy"
awsome game
Pretty graphics but that's pretty much the only aspect of the game that doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste.   I'm a big fan of the predecessor of the series. However Grid 2 broke ties with the well working concept everyone liked so much. Not just the menues and unskipable cutscenes are a burden to navigate through but the courses as well are mostly generic and repetative. The choice of cars feels limited and too unbalanced and events with no prior info or overview are just a no go. Not to mention the missing cockpit view or that I've played PS1 games with better AI.   So in conclusion: If you like racing games... skip this one or at least wait for a huge discount.
"80/10. Enjoyable arcade-like racing game.  Nice graphics. Nice gameplay &amp; handling.  I found most of the game VERY easy, often lapping competitors.. Lots of DLC cars for online gameplay.."
Plays very poorly. The car is so bad at turning that the game is umplayable. Don't pick up even if it's free
"Love the game, hopefully a 3rd one comes out.."
Fun game great graphics. Don't expect to play online though. Servers are still up but nobody is ever on.
good game. i like play this racing game. we can customize our car and choose three different sponsor. running very well on my laptop. love this racing. better than grid series before.
the crashes are prrety bad-♥♥♥. needs ps3 controller support - or steeam does
like it a lot good game  get this game 
"Good game, but there is so many russians idiots in MP who cant use breaks and cant play it. ♥♥♥♥"
I would rather play GRID. This is just a waste of money.
"Fantastic. GRID 2 is an amazing racing game. The graphics are excellent even by today's standards and the physics are a perfect mix of arcade and simulation, so this game acually works okay with the arrow keys. The career does seem a bit short, but it is well plotted and will keep you wanting to play. However, the AI's can sometimes be very rage inducing because they try and spin you out half the time. It is fairly easy to get back on track, until you get spun out again. You can rewind, but you only have 5 per race. The multiplayer functions smoothly, but you usually end up in some really high tier race. Overall, I recommend this game, it is completely worth the money. In fact, I would pay $35-$40 instead of $30 for the standard game."
Worst racing game I've ever played. I prefer realism when playing racing games. Makes me glad I didn't pay full price or even half price got it in Humble Jumbo Bundle 3. Paid $6.25 for the hole thing.
If you don't have all dlc this game suck ♥♥♥♥ :)
It's a fun game. Has the best racing game engine I have seen and has good graphics. (DOWNLOAD)
"Unskippable ESPN SportsCenter cutscenes. Unskippable tutorial videos and other 'team member narrator' monologues. First 2 hours of racing limited to American muscle cars and Nissan whatevers. Often given a choice of two identical cars to win. Once you make your choice, they tell you that you can still unlock the other one. What's the point of making a choice if it doesn't matter afterwards? In a field of 12 cars, only 2 of them are ever challenging, not because they are good drivers, but because they started at the front and have built a huge lead. 'Rival' drivers cheat. My rival, Harrison Carter, was able to accelerate faster than any other car on the track. Also, he beat me on the first race, so he gets to start the second at pole position. I came in second, so I get sent to the back of the pack to start the second race. Who's managing these series? Driving feels floaty and disconnected. No sense of progression or a cohesive garage. Apparently, I own 12 cars and didn't even notice. Split screen limited by career progress. You can only drive cars you unlock. Tons of DLC cars in quickrace and split screen. I have 9 cars to choose from but 8 of them cost money. Most customization options locked by level. I can't paint my car blue until I'm level 3.  There are many racing games on the market. GRID 2 is one of them. Pick a different one."
While not as good as its previous installment it is still a pretty solid game.
very fun and educational
"Very nice racing game made for PC! This game is one of those games where you except tons of good game quality and this game does it with style! You have exellent keyboard steering as well, so if you dont have steering wheel, dont worry this is easy with keyboard too. I recommend this game to anyone motorhead because its unique experience what you get while playing this game, I'm giving this game 10/10. BUY THIS GAME NOW!"
"totally ♥♥♥♥ game in my life, i better spend more cash for need for speed, bad setting , the car is totally bad.  i quit this game in 0.4 hours , thanks god .... i spend money for ♥♥♥♥"
"You'd be better off getting the original GRID. You know, the one that DID win the awards and sold couple million copies.  This one is basically the same as the original, only worse. You do the same thing but are given less options, less real world tracks less cars and shorter races. Seriously. Half the races your career consists of have ONE lap. ONE. Driving assists are always on with no option to disable them makes the game pretty easy for anyone familiar with racing games. It's no longer 'almost a racing sim' where you can still turn assists on and have fun with it. You're only getting the 'arcade' experience. Even on the highest difficulty I had no trouble winning races. Unless it's a one lap race that you start from last place - good luck with that. Only new and interesting mode is the 'Overtake' but it's ruined by the AI obviously being awarded way more points that you can earn yourself unless you have an absolutely perfect run. I understand AI needs to cheat sometimes but at least don't do it in front of my eyes. Other modes have been dumbed down. Drift now consists of you making a SINGLE run down like 3-4 turns on one of the regular tracks, which are completely not meant for that, while your driving assists are still on. No skill is required. It's a joke basically. Also no 24h Le Mans or 20-something car races. 6 cars max, short tracks, 1-2 laps each. "
"So I am playing the game on the free weekend and I think it's 'ok', if you have never played Grid just buy part 1, why?  Well part 1 has much more customizable controls and the joystick on the computer controllers or the d-pad is not so sensitive. From the very first race on the Mustang you feel way too sensitive to be driving, it is not realistic. Ok so it's an arcade type racer so where's my sensitivity bar? No slider bar in the options means you're stuck with what you got.   Overall it is an ok game but I am dissapointed. The biggest flaw is not being able to tailor the sensitivity on my controller. It is probably better on console anyway. I'll pass on this one.   3 out of 5. Average.   p.s.  The story is ok and interesting, it's a different game than part 1. Just buy part 1."
"Not a bad game, I worked out that by editing a file in the game directory it's possible to enable those Intel only FX on any PC. Overall well worth the $8 while it's on sale."
"Nice game, good graphics. Good game all round I would recommend to anyone"
One of the best racing games ever.
Great game.
Good quality but no cockpit view is annoying. Could be fixed with the many mods though that do work on multiplayer.
such a cool racing game.. love to wreck another racing player lol Best Game Ever i hope i could make my own character/driver that would be awesome
"I enjoy arcade racing games (like this one) much more than racing games that try to be on the more 'realistic' side (like Forza). I don't like waiting to hold down the controller's trigger all the way, and this game let's me do that. This is a great arcade racer not only because it provides an excellent variety of fun and unique challenges, but also because it has a basic timeline without an excessive number of cutscenes and story noise. Never a dull moment in this game, and there are difficulty settings to suit any racer's skill level. In Career mode, you feel like you actually make progress, and in Arcade mode, you can have the same amount of fun without messing up your career. Recommend for anyone who is looking for a great arcade racer."
Nice arcade style racer with pretty graphics and good handling.
"Played Grid 2 for 15 hours now and loving every minute of it career mode is good fun, graphics are beautiful and physics are pretty good. Theres not too many people playing the online but there are a few so convince a few friends like I did and be ready for a really fun online expierence filled with crashing into friends to sabotage their race like me or driving well to win... I prefer sabotage but meh ;D recommend if you can get some friends to play :)"
"Don't get me wrong, this game is heaps of fun, but not as realistic as say, Dirt. But, when you buy a dlc and want to race around with a friend in your brand new car, the lobby restricts it. If i knew i wouldn't touch the dlc's"
"I have played this game on another account and i have to say that this game is fairly good. It has nice graphics, runs stable and the handling is also great for a racing game like this one.  I only really mis the cockpit/dashboard view (I know there is an mod availible for this)  To create another video review for this game was pointless (there are enough of them already). So I decided to create a 3D Review for this game to review the 3D Performance of Grid 2.  You can check out the 3D review, footage and gameplay here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edDzgqcXSLA  "
"Faced paced races, an interesting idea and cool cars make this an extremely entertaining game!"
Very fun racing game with competetive elements and and arcade-like atmosphere. Very enjoyable with nice graphics and replayable races. Worth it if you like racing games
A great racing game and amazing graphics!
"Very much like the first game, if you liked that one, you'll like this one"
It may not be like GRID 1 but GRID 2 has won my interest on it's own merits. Recommended for arcade racing fans.
Really nice game. Love the graphics.
Grid One is better than Grid 2. Thats all.
If you like racing games check it out!
"Bought this game on DVD as well a while back and it's really gorgeous. Beautiful graphics and very smooth controls, I love it.  9/10 because it's definately one of the better racing games I've played so far and it looks REALLY good."
defo chalenging fast plenty drift n spills collin mcray style
One of my favorite realistic racing games. Don't play this game thinking it's Burnout or you'd be losing alot of your races lol.
"One of the best racing games I've played in a while, and I only got it for 8 bucks! I definitely recommend this one to racing fans everywhere"
Dull campaign :( ! car simulations are terrible and i drift around every corner unintentionally.
A big step backwards compared with the first Grid.  * All those city tracks are just not interesting. * Too much DLC and the base game is too little. * Handling just took a step backwards * Lacking the 'managing team' feeling from the first game. They should expand on it. Not remove it. * Artificial difficulty. Making the AI cars the equal of a Konigstiger tank while your car is a 2CV  Get it for cheap or get the first one.
One of the best sim racing games on PC! Highly recommended!
"GRID 2 is a fun but serious racing game, Good Graphics, fast game, Nice race tracks and seems realistic and good attention to detail in this game. If you are a serious racing game type of person this game is for you but if you aren't then don't expect it to be like Mario kart. I liked playing this game when it was free on steam and it is on my wishlist! =) Only downfalls, Online multiplayer could have some more work like for instance private lobbies, and more gamemodes like Forza motersport has on xbox."
GET F**KED M8 i got this sh*t when it was free and played once next day says i have to pay for it like you wot m8 ill rek you m9
"It's a Great Game, I Recommend it, worths its price, great quality graphics and gameplay /physics, I really dont udnerstand why so much hate and negative reviews from others. One negative is that there's not much people playing online and if you are higher level sometimes you can be get kicked often from other hosts which makes you most times go back to single player/carrier mode.  A good way is to find other skilled players to you level and send a friend request to have someone to play with. "
"DOES NOT HAVE A DRIVER'S SEAT CAMERA VIEW!!!!!!!  This was a dealbreaker for me, and I wish i had known before I spent the $3 or whatever this was on sale for. Other than that it is a racing game. There are cars and tracks. The game does drifting well in my opinion. From the makers of Dirt."
"Simply an amazing great experience of playing a racing game like this with a huge speed sensation while racing! the only bad thing is there isn't a cockpit unless you go for the mods...and i would love to see more tracks like London or Madrid for example...but, overall is a wonderful game you can't skip, especially if you're into racing games!"
Arcade physics and gameplay. Too unrealistic for my tastes.
"Very good, but hard game!"
Best racing game ever 
thumbs uppp!
"fun, but takes ♥♥♥♥ing ages to quit the game. its better just to Ctrl Alt Del"
Yea this game owns hard.
Arcade can be done so much better.
"A-Maz-ING!!! The best game ever! Well, not ever. Could do with a cockpit view but, meh! It's great otherwise!"
A must have for every race fan!!!
A well made racing game with oustanding graphics. The options offered to a gamer for creating a personal livery are both numerous and professionnally done. GRID 2 is an auto racing game with varied race courses and numerous vehicle models available (I have 29 w/DLC included) for customizing. I strongly recommend GRID 2 to gamers and racing fans alike.
The first GRID is far better! I was on my wishlist and when I played the demo I deleted it... FAST!
its asam thank you 
"you should buy this games on holidays sales , under 10$"
Its probably worst racing game i have ever played.
This was a good game for me playing it for 4 hours during free weekend :)
Racing games are hard and i suck at them but atleast they look good.
"Enjoyable racing game that frustrates me.   I cannot drive the cars on the tracks I like. The career mode is tiresome and the online servers is now [March 2015] more or less empty.   The actual driving however is fun. The controls are good, the tracks are boring except a few in the South Of France and California. The cars look and fell great.   Not sure if I should be positive or not.   7/10   A good racing game let down by poor career mode, average tracks and little online community."
"Greatest racing game ive played in a while. Will deff be picking up Grid- Autosport. Amazing graphics, great performance, many cars to choose and win, plenty of tracks, plenty of different events to keep it fresh and exciting, good paint and sponsor features. Much gameplay and tons of racing fun to be made. The way cars drive, the way speed feels, the drifting...this game does a stupendous job at executing good racing with some fun destruction and a competitive touch by giving it a DGAF attitude with smashing cars and beating your way to first! A good buy."
plays like the first and beautiful to watch
"This is one of the kind of racing game i'm looking for~ It have splitscreen option, customization,Variety of cars and maps, and so pleasing graphic! But, in the eyes of consumer(me)~why you(developer) must seperate the DLC? the DLC isn't really worth it :( but without the DLC the game will get bored quick and voids. The rest are so fine, This co-op/splitscreen is the reason you enjoy playing this game~ especially you are in home playing with your mates. Joystick are soo recommend!  90% Come mate try beat me on splitscreen~"
"A fun game. Nice cars, nice tracks, not too easy. Great gameplay. Except i didnt play 100 hours on this"
"I will be honest, I do not like this game but I would still recommend it. I'm not a realist when it comes to my racing games.  I like my racing games with a little more give than Grid 2 provides. With that being said lets get into the meat and potatoes of my review.   The game is very beautiful. Sound and frame rate seems solid enough. The Gimic 'flashback' feels just right and helpful. It takes a lot of the punch out of how real the cars handle. Cars in career look very well for being tuned for racing. I almost lost it when I saw the name 'Fairlady Z.' Sadly it was more modern version and not the S30.  Races are not impossible and with flashback you could win most if not all of them. I just felt like I was driving more than racing. Realism is strong and can pull you out of the speed-buzz you get.  If you are look for realist style racing game then I would recommend Grid 2. I however will not be adding it to my personal collection. I hope this help fill in any thoughts you have. If I can answer any questions, just comment on my review!"
£30 for the extra cars?? really whats wrong with developers. great game but not for £60 all together. this is why people download things.  id recomend this game and recomend the developers rethink there prices and offer extras cheaper at least.
"Very fun racing game, but don't expect it to be a realistic driving experience."
+cool car damage +fun online gameplay +good graphics  -poor engine sounds -arcade oriented -high level racers are untouchable  I could recommend this game for novice racers that enjoyed late NFS series.  
"I love how this game has a reverse time button, it it very uniqe for a racing game, love it!"
"This game is really good, I love the whole WSR racing leage Fiction story it's very cool. I just WISH I can tweak my race cars suspension settings, brake bias, engine timing, boost presure.....  stuff like that"
It manipulates user's play badly. Super mario is better to recommend than this.
Awesome game have to buy it.
"It's a pretty enjoyable game, but with some very irritating problems.  Pros: - Good graphics - Handles and looks fairly realistically - Enjoyable and the perfect length  Cons: - The volume, can't be turned off, or lowered beneath 50% in the game - Many cars can only be obtained through pricy DLC - Keyboard occasionally locks, no fix online"
"If you like racing sims, do not buy this game. 4/10 for realism. I gave it 4 because the sounds are good and the real-world track layouts are fairly legit (2pts each?).  On the other hand: if you like oversteer for days, arcade-style racing, a verbose engineer talking to you and fancy menus then this is your game. 9 out of 10 Philistines will be able to drift in this game."
"Things I´ve learned from this game:  -Japanese cars are always faster than any other -Drifting the ideal raceline is faster than normally driving it -If you´re driving according do normal rules (DTM, F1 p.ex.) you´re not gonna win. Car to car contact is needed, although it will affect the performance of your car-&gt; you´ll have to learn your car carefully. That´s probably the reason why my most used car is the Nissan Silvia S15 or the BRZ untill now (WSR Season 2) through all the events where i could choose my car. (Tip: BRZ for racetracks, Silvia for 'Street Races') -Drifting needs a lot more driving skill than NFS said. -Don´t play racing games at night time; You ARE gonna rage at the A.I., I promise; speaking of my own experience right now :D Still a very fun game for casual racer guys. If you are into simulations, I´m not really sure, it is pretty realistic but you can obviously trick the physics somehow by going sideways. I turned off all help and stuff with only 5 resets or something, but still it seems to have wider limits than a sim.  Overall it´s still a great balance between arcade and simulation and I love it. I like race games like NFS, but NFS has gone to whatever the ♥♥♥♥, maybe ♥♥♥♥ or something and Grid2 just feels really like I think racegames for casual gamers should feel. So if you´re tired of too much realism or tired of NFS because NFS is ♥♥♥♥, this is the game to go with, although there are no cops in it."
Awesome racing game! I like when you go back in time... or how it's called....rewind....i don't know!
Great game. Enjoyed a lot.
"This is a pretty decent racing game. Not a lot of fine tuning that you'll find in other simulators, but the racing is solid. My only complaint was the push to drift, since I'm not into drifting at all."
Awesome Arcade Racer!
one of the best racing games ever!!
"Honestly, not great. I'm used to playing f1 and need for speed (particularly most wanted) compared to them the physics engine is disappointing and was a real let down. If buying this again I wouldn't now do it. But if you like ultra sensitive and damaging engines then this is the game ofr you but in my opinion it is bad."
"Was expecting something like the fantastic GRID 1, but really really dissapointed to the arcady physics. The graphics is good but the engine sound is also dissapointing"
Nice Racing Game
"Very fun game. I love how you can't just mod your car to be better than everyone you're racing (see Forza, etc.). Every race is a challenge. The only problem with this is if you have trouble with a particular track, you can be stuck doing it over and over again for a very long time. Still, best racing game I've played in a long time. I kinda want to buy a wheel for my computer because of it."
Clarkson approves.
GRID 2 IS AWESOME!!!!
"Great driving game, with a weird funny plot and amazing graphics! Not a complete winner though. A bit loose driving with both the Xbox gamepad and Logitech Driving Forge GT. More tight handling when driving balanced cars. But you start with drift cars so you should expect to crash quite many times in the beginning."
"This is a great racing game. Don't nickle and dime it to death about how it don't make your toast in the morning or knit you a sweater. There is a sweet and sour goodness here. Visually, the game is just total immersion. Controls are spot on... the Codemasters, yes, they do have a bit of experience here. The raceways are exceptional for both feel and visuals and require finesse and agression to win. Dip it in some dumpling sauce and enjoy... if you can stand the spicy heat. If not, go play some match-3 and get outta here with your whiny cry baby stuff. :-P"
The best racing game you can play on a mac. It's addictive too
Ended up deleting this game because of the fact that it doesn't like full screen.. right okay then.
The car game I´ve been awaiting for... Just makes Forza Horizon bites the dust
"This game is a lot of fun, but often the online is bad with few people. But the singleplayer is one of the best in a racing game. The physics are good but many of the cars feels arcady to drive. The game is fun to play but feels a bit arcady compared to the newest GRID game Grid Autosport."
"Some details are not there, as the view fps. but the graphics are better. They should add a minimum of tuning his'll cool"
very gud game had it for 2 days and luv it drifting so awesome to drift the nice smooth corners
"The racing is good, controls are effective and well handled, single player is fun and there are various challenges and different types of races to continue before reaching the next league. I find myself competing against the same names a lot and targetting them as my rival, I fail to see why I'm always put into second last position each round when I finished first in the previous... I suppose it would be too easy and less competitive if I was in first starting position each lap but I digress.   There's a lot to select in terms of cars and upgrades online, however unless you remember the names of the maps, there's little knowledge to know if you like the map, or mode to play on. As I've entered the game late, the online community is small, and because of that any race that I enter I'm competing against level 99s who have fully upgraded cars and the best of the best to choose from... of course I'm not going to win this one, this is just a participatory role now.   I dispise the real 8+ man racing mode as it usually ends up everyone crashing into mayhem and completely destroying my vehicle within 3 seconds of the race and it's whoever in front avoids the havoc, will inevitably win."
"An excellent sequel to the original GRID, although it forgoes the team aspect entirely and instead opts for a (too?) streamlined story mode."
Another great GRID game. Nice graphics and when you choose to make the gameplay hard it really gets hard. Do play it with a steering wheel (works fine)  Really consider this game
"I know what you're saying: 'Dude, you only have 6 hours in?'  I know, bro. But that was 6 hours straight!!!! :) Once I put in the cockpit mod, I raced until my fingers fell off.  The funny thing is that I wanted to test it against GRID.  Bro, I must admit, it passes with flying colors. I mean, it's not better than GRID simply because of the cockpit fiasco.  I mean, really, 5% my a.$.$.!  But other than that, the racing sim rocks donkey-butt booty! I mean the visuals are crisp and clear, the gameplay is just as frantic as GRID, and you can get a lot of milage out of those DLCs too. I tested everything and it all came up clean...for 6 hours!  I'm trying to get back into soon, but with Autosport, DiRT Rally, Project Cars, Wreckfest and GRID, this games being treated like a stepchild. But if you're looking to grab it, then get it bro. You will reap some serious rewards for your investment."
One of my favorite racing games for sure. i was looking for a really good NFS but was getting mixed reviews.. this is like NFS and a slight bit of Forza but definitley closer to NFS. The physics of this game are fenominal not to mention the graphics are crystal clear (macbook pro retina display). definitly a great buy
"horrible game, it is really fun until the save file becomes corrupt or the game decides to restart you from the beginning. DO NOT BUY"
"Fun game when you can play it. one of the most unfriendly games I have ever used. you just want to play but it doesnt let you you cannot just play a game,and you can be waiting ages before it gives you anything playable"
"This game is flawed. As someone who plays many racing games, what the devs were thinking, I do not know. Your cars are weak, and the AIs are strong. Any collision won't effect them in the slightest, but will send you flying. The game discourages driving collisions, but has an AI that only focuses on running into you.  Lord help you if you don't have a controller. The keyboard controls are very poor.  I somehow played half way through the game, thinking that perhaps some issues would be fixed later. They were not.  I do not recommend this game."
"Not As Good As Grid 1, Not As Solid As Grid Auto Sport But Still Looks Good And Plays Ok. Very Slippery With All The Drift. A Little Too Much At times But Its A Fun Run Through And Can Give A Challenge. Good Game"
""
"Grid 2 is the kind of game that achieve to be either good and bad. It's a classic arcade racing game in a world where racing means slidde &amp; drift in everycorner. If you like cars, arcade racing game, being allowed to do mistakes and drift in a corner like a character in 'Initial-D', this game is for you. Music is cool, audio is not very realistic according to cars' engines but who cares, it works perfectly."
A bit like Billy's mind
Stop making me drift whenever I make a turn.
"This game is just boring. Unskippable pointless cutscenes, boring and repetitive races due to lack of tracks, cars and gamemodes. I'd just say that you should get GRID 1 instead, as it's better in my opinion. This is basically regressed GRID 1 with better graphics. I will certainly be refunding this game."
my information.... amaizing
This game is REALLY fun but i have a problem...  when i install the DLC (because i bought the reloaded edition) i get an error saying something like 'the DLC is corrupted' or something and i cant find ANY way to fix it!! PLZ make a patch for this... until then i cant recommend this game  taco/dorito -food gn
"This is the racing game I need in my life right now. It handles like a dream. Playing with friends, even 1v1, is really fun. And it can even be carried by its singleplayer! Highly reccomend!"
"How amzing is it that this game mangaes to balance out experience, gameplay and graphics?! I've never had so much fun ever in a racing game! A classic that deserves t be up there with Forza 4 and Gran Turismo 1. Buy it, no exceptions!"
"I wish i said, i liked it... But i will not recommend this game to THOSE WHO PLAYED GRID 1. If you just saw the game on sale or on forums and so... you might wanna give it a try. But definitely not GRID 1 players"
"I can not recommend this game for the asking price, with DLC and all. I bought the game for 7 dollars and all the DLC for 12 dollars. The game has craaaazy car controls, and im a pro driver, and i was having trouble. Anyway, i got a solid 40 hours out of this game and thats great. But for full price, just move on and find something better to do."
"it's good. Not enough cars, you'll have to buy it with your real money."
got it on sale 75% ...highly recommended racing game (8/10)
"Highly recommend if you have a wired controller, fun and mostly friendly gamers online. a great laugh specially with a few spin outs and crashes."
"There’s a couple of things I miss about the first GRID:  -I’d rather win money instead of fans, it motivated me more because with the money I could buy cars, plus I’d make you think more about the sponsors that you choose being that because of them you could make so much money out of every race.  -I loved the camera in first person from inside the car that the original GRID had, it’s a shame that they eliminated that.  -I liked more the original’s GRID campaign, the fact that you had to make your own team to compete in the major leagues, instead of making your own championship.  But beside all of that the game is great, it’s one of the best racing games out there (it’s my favorite at least), it doesn’t bore you, there’s always something to do, it has great replayability and the campaign is pretty good, the graphics are gorgeous and it is well optimized, also I loved the fact that they added a split screen mode. 100% recommended.   P.S.: (Sorry for the bad english tho) "
very good game easy controls
"GRID 1 was fantastic, so it's a real shame that this game doesn't live up to the standards set in GRID one at all."
this game is verry good
"Fun game to play with mates or by yourself, Has quite alot of hours to be put into the game but in 7 hours I have got to season 3 plus doing all side challenges / races etc but I would get this game while it is on sale and if you have a Intel graphics card and you think it can not run it, Intel HD Graphics 3000 and up can run this game at medium settings with about 28-35 FPS plus the processor is like 2.4 ghz minimum but a 1.80 + dual core or quad core is fine   ------ This Game Is    RECOMMENDED    ------"
"Damn, I love this game! A fun career mode, clean retry system, and a relly pretty graphics.  The cars may be a bit on the more arcade side, but its nice they included a satisfying damage visuals. The options let you customize the game to your feel and the car painting is fun too. Easy to use and very hard to come out with a ugly car... unless well you have to eye for design.  I got it on sale and it was completely worth it, even for 30 bucks its not bad either. Looking into picking up some of the DLC"
"Game is ok. AI will ram you. You go faster if you are aggressive = hit walls, hit cars. So its really not a sim, pure arcade. I'm pretty close to finishing all the races and I had no issues until the last race I just completed... I was in 1st ahead by 5 seconds, crossed the finish line and ended up in 3rd place magically. Still won the event but ♥♥♥♥ that."
Its good 
"Exellent game, but if you are going to buy it make sure you also buy the DLC pack. "
"Best on Intel Haswell CPU.......Although it is not a simulator game, it still good for the new born racers."
"you have to log in to windows gaming service online to save games. if that isnt disruptive DRM, i don tknow what is...,.15 mins to find passwords etc."
sorry to be a party ruiner but this game sucks!
"What to say about this game. Besides the whole deal around the cockpit view, there's much much more this game doesnt get right. First of all it's a fun game which has good looking graphics that run fairly well on slower computers and has a great destruction model of the cars. This beeing said, the game itself is like a broken record (the same stuff all over again), simply said the single player is like any other racing game, you are trying to be the best racer in a racing league, with the distinction that now you are supposed to be the poster-boy for the racing series, but it doesnt make any difference at all. The multiplayer is where the game is supposed to shine, unfortunately, it isnt true. Even though technically the MP works fine, the people completely ruin the expirience, To explain: most people ram you and grind the bariers around the corners. Simply said, most poeple play it more like Burnout rather than a somewhat serous racing game.  So to sum up, it's not a simulator, it's not an simulator like racer (e.g. the first GRID of the NFS Shift series). It's an arcade racer, I don't recommed it for the full price, you may considder getting the game if it's heavily discounted (75% or more). If you are looking for a fun arcade racer, get it, if you are looking for a simillar expirience like the first GRID, get GRID or NFS SHIFT 1 or 2.  I'm still recommending the game as it's fun when all it's elements work, and I enjoyed it except for the occasional frustration in multiplayer."
You can't play with Logitech GT unplayable. It have nice graphic the sound is good.
Great game. Even better when 5.1 surround is turned on as the narrator bugs and you cannot hear him. Turns it into a really fun racing experience without the annoying voice over talking to you like you are an idiot.
Nice arcade style racer with pretty graphics and good handling.
"Generic Racer like any other, with tons of DLC."
"Grate game! I like multyplayer, how you can upgrade cars, only if ther wont be any DLC..."
"Sadly this sequel to what I consider to be the best racing title of the recent era has been horribly americanised (dear god I want to stab the stupid 'companion character') and has had all of the lovely freedom to pick your races from the original butchered up with a frankly dull story about some billionaire playboy fellow. I am glad I picked this up in a Humble Bundle instead of having forked out full price for this, because my contribution to charity there is probably the only good this about this game!"
"Beautiful graphics. Nice customization options for cars. Handling too arcade-y for my tastes, but fun. Cheesy forced 'storyline'. I can live with that. It's the car game way. But when I realized there was no tuning system; no parts for me to buy or tweak, I lost interest in the game. It's just not for me. But it is not a bad game."
"Oh my glob - I'm not sure whether it's just because I'm on Very Hard difficulty, but the singleplayer races are completely rigged to make the AI win in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways.  All their cars are magically faster, even if they are using the same car you have and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing I came accross, in the first promotion race where you need to overtake utility trucks without crashing to score points, even if you race super clean without a collision and overtake the other racer (the AI who I saw crash a number of times before I overtook him), the AI racer still manages to win the race with 32,000 points. It's just stupid.  I like to play on the harder difficulties in games, but I hate it when they think making it purely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is the way to go instead of giving the AI better driving skills (or whatever depending on the type of game) to make it a more realistic hardness.  It's like when they make a shooter game harder by giving the AI just a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hp, instead of making them smarter and more skilled.  Oh and also in this game, it seems if you try and ram an opponents car it smashes you instead and spins you out, but if they ram you, it smashes you and spins you out...seems fair.  I haven't played the multiplayer because I don't think anyone plays it.  I wouldn't reccommend this game if you want realism, the driving on its own is good, but the rigged AI ruin it."
"Lap a racer, i get last... 11/10 would not buy"
Pretty graphics but that's pretty much the only aspect of the game that doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste.   I'm a big fan of the predecessor of the series. However Grid 2 broke ties with the well working concept everyone liked so much. Not just the menues and unskipable cutscenes are a burden to navigate through but the courses as well are mostly generic and repetative. The choice of cars feels limited and too unbalanced and events with no prior info or overview are just a no go. Not to mention the missing cockpit view or that I've played PS1 games with better AI.   So in conclusion: If you like racing games... skip this one or at least wait for a huge discount.
"80/10. Enjoyable arcade-like racing game.  Nice graphics. Nice gameplay &amp; handling.  I found most of the game VERY easy, often lapping competitors.. Lots of DLC cars for online gameplay.."
very nice game
Typical racing game. Worth to play
Great graphics. Great Cars. Arcade driving. One of best racers out there
10/10 good all round car racing game
"I tried so hard to get this game to work for me. I love racing games and this game had good reviews. The handling in this game is absurd. I can't get past the first race and I am good with racing games. I watched youtube videos because I figured I was doing something wrong, but it STILL feels like I'm on ice the whole time.....on easy mode. I really wish they had a setting for the sensitivity of the buttons, specifically left and right. Wow...I wish I could have my money back. Or at least have the devs adjust the sensitivity so the game is playable. I truely feel that this game was a waste of time and money."
Offers a great sense of speed and isnt packed full of LAMBOOGEENEEZ and BOOGAADEEZ. It actually has some decent cars like the silvia and E30. However the online is completely dead so consider that when purchasing.
dude..what an amazing game so far. i hear controller input isn't that great atm but on the wheel this ♥♥♥♥ is sick!!!
"This game has too many faults to ever be good. Physics are highly inconsistent, npc AI is inconsistent. The AI always take corners wide and which inevitably leads to collisions. No matter how you try you always come out as the loser in any collision which means passing is a huge chore. passing is mandatory since you always start close to last place so you can't just stay out front. To top it off in touge matches collision equals disqualification, but if you are in the lead and the npc hits YOU you get disqualified not your opponent; how does that make sense? One last quip that should scare all race fans away is that the npc cars occasionally get 'power ups' I've been in an identical car to the npc and watched them blow by me on a straightaway like they have nitrous... How do you win when that happens? Simple you can't. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
"I really want to like this game, because I always liked Codemasters (CMR 1 on PS one was my first contact). While it's featuring an okay story and pretty cars, it has some issues  *Pro: + The Career + Variety of cars + Variety of Races + Challenges  *Con: - The in other reviews mentioned AI drivers, who are sometimes Enzo Ferrari himself, sometimes 3-year-olds - AI pathing and awarenes, they drive like the Player isn't there, so let him crash into their rear end or ram him at full speed.  - In addition, questionable physics: Any contact with AI drivers will make you lose the duel, even if you PIT them with full speed so that their vehicle should spin like yours always does. - Endgame loses quality - NO online community   I picked it up with a Humble Bundle, wouldn't buy it full price, but if it is and you're into racing: give it a try."
great racing game tho it could need a wider selection of cars
This is an OK game and worth buying but not a game I am likely to recommend. The difficulty really seems to ramp up at the end and along with increased track lengths the game gets quite tedious. In the end I dialled back the diffculty simply to stop myself becoming too bored. The rubber banding on the longer tracks is very noticable and good driving is not rewarded enough with descent gains.
10/10 physics
amazing game! played it for 4 hours when it was given out for free and loved every moment of it.  im on a mac from 2010 and I can run this in ultra settings with an avarage of 28 - 40 fps! a full recomendation for this game i cant think of any better racer.
great game get it and play with me
"This may not be the racing game you are looking for, so I'd read up on it before buying.  Definitely not anywhere near a simulation game - the handling feels exagerated, there is no in car view, there is far too much drifting in pretty much every car and the story mode seems to be obsessed with social media to an embarasing extent. Apparently the online mode is pretty much dead, but I've not really tried it. The DLC seems poorly implemented too - the (numerous) DLC packs add new tracks and game modes, yet those new tracks are only available in free race, not in the story mode.  There is a good reason to own this game though - it has a fantastic split screen mode. I enjoy playing arcade racers against people who are in the room with me, and this is one of the best I've come across on PC. If you're like me and looking for decent PC split screen games, I'd recomend picking the complete package up. It's also a good game to have if you're looking for a casual racing game to play single player.  If you're a serious racing gamer this is probably not one you'd want to buy."
Great graphic! Not too easy
A comprehensive and fun racing game with solid collision physics.
"I urge you with caution with playing this or any other codemasters racing games if you have a logitech keyboard, specifically a G110 like I have. For some reason the game locks up and makes my PC crash if i use this particular keyboard or any other logitech product.   Other than the logitech input device issues, this is a fantastic game so im going to give it a thumbs up!"
But the handling of the vehicles is a bit to get used to.
defo chalenging fast plenty drift n spills collin mcray style
One of my favorite realistic racing games. Don't play this game thinking it's Burnout or you'd be losing alot of your races lol.
"Very much like the first game, if you liked that one, you'll like this one"
It may not be like GRID 1 but GRID 2 has won my interest on it's own merits. Recommended for arcade racing fans.
"When the free-weekend for this game went on, I decided to try this out. I didn't know I would become addicted. I don't usually play racing games but this has changed my mind. I definitly think I am gonna buy this golden game! 10/10"
"Definitely a let-down after the high standard the original GRID set. They made some neat features like tracks that change as you move through them, AI that doesn't rubberband back to you, and larger cities, but it was in vain since the game was not as fun. I think the original GRID was a little more arcady but it added some character. As I played GRID 2, I felt it was lacking something; I couldn't race how I wanted to.   Also, the story was overdone and a little too cheesy. In GRID 1, the player was a low ranking driver hired to compete against Ravenwood. Slowly, they got better until they were racing in global races as opposed to small local events. In GRID 2, you start out street racing, get 'recorded,' and then get 'famous' through internet videos and social media. To me, it was a bit of a stretch and I prefer the simpler, more generic racing story.  TL;DR: Overall, GRID 2 was fun but it did not live up to the original's standard. It didn't feel right and I thought it was too restrictive. Wait and see about Autosport."
"The way you have to control the vehicles just infuriates me. Im sure once you do it gets better, but the learning curve is just rediculous in this game"
"Well, this game starts great. You get to play some races with a wide variety of cars and everthing's pretty nice. But after some time you proceed in the WSR league and from season to season it gets harder. Now you are starting to notice that the tracks stay more and more the same and you only drive longer variants or more laps. Especially in one-on-one races where you have to drive the same courses 3 times in a row against different opponents.  In the last season the r3t4rd3d aspects of the game get the deepest impact. Since there are no qualifyings your starting position is always in the mid-field or the back of the track. This results in ever-repeating overtaking orgies where you have to catch a bulk of slow cars just to get to the few fast drivers that pack a challange. One thing that especially p1ssed me off was that though you start in the back of the pack in most races this is not valid for drift events. In drift events you might want to take it a bit slower to get a better angle at the right positions. But you can screw that because almost everyone else seems to start after you and seems to have no interest in real drifting. Instead they are just passing the course quickly. If one of those m0r0nic AI driver touches you while you block the road drifting sideways in a wide angle all your points of that drift are forfeit since a collision is detected. Well done Codemasters.  If I had to rate this game using american school marks, I'd give the early game a B+ and the late game a D, resulting in a mediocre C for the entire game."
i got this when it first came out and i realy liked it however Qosmio v2 didn't like the ammount of wok it had to do to run it aka 460m nivida n 8 gb ram to put it simply if your computer has heat trobles this game is way wores however i loved it got to japan eventsn it overheated n corrupted the save i rage qiut untill a few days ago andwith Qosmio v3 with a 770m gtx nivida card and 32 gb o ram it has no trouble running this game lol border lands 2 make it run hotter then this game out of club events on to getting my bugati varon ss YAY   in short good game tons o cars and a very fun game to play   just make sure comuter can handle it first don't want my screw up it killed Qoxmio v2
"OK, This is a great game. What i like about it, it that it has an acheivable ending. The gameplay is interesting, the challenges are great (except didn't get into the drift driving), the cars are great, the graphics are excellent! Would instantly buy a GRID 3 if it is developed."
"Very good racing game, arcade physics with a track setting, a bit like nfs shift"
"Rubbish game, trying to be a serious racer without the serious handling to match."
"Slash and burn, ride or die, 'this' is most certainly the game that will make Burn-Out look like a complete puppy in comparison, and the best thing of all - you can play more then just two at a time."
Absolutely brilliant game good variety of modes tracks and cars and the flashback thing is really handy if you have crashed or need to perfect that corner. 9/10
"Grid 2 is not a bad game at all, focuses more on drifting than anything which is fun but im more of a simulator fan, good range of cars, tracks do get a bit repetitive after a while, would recommend this if want to race but not to serious tbh, not enough realism for me but as said, fun all the same."
"Just... no. This game has a cool climate, interesting mechanics, modes and tracks. But what's wrong? It's nothing special. Just another street racing game with terrible physics and inconsistency. -420/10 -IGN"
"Good game, but if you are looking for a challenge this isn't it. Even on hard things are easy, however there is a learning curve to start out with to make things difficult."
"This is a very good game. It is better than other racing games on the pc, due to the controls. The vehicles are easy to drive using a keyboard."
"Even after placing first in the qualifying races and being number 1 in tournament points, you still start towards the back of the pack just to force increased difficulty instead of making it a hard fought race, it just ends up being you weaving the bad drivers to catch up to the 'featured driver' who always starts frist on the grid. Not only is this frustrating(lowering the difficulty makes it much too easy) it distracts you from the game and takes you out of the world it so desperately tries to emerge you in."
"Was a little confused at the begining, had some problem setter up the controler. But then I totaly got stuck playing it, and i'm having alot of fun! I'd recommend getting it from the Humble Bundle if you have the chance to get it before it end."
"So far i played a little, but i recommend this game (so far, again). Nice cars, good maps and awesome graphics."
"There's too many loading screens and flashy transition screens, it takes forever to do anything. I got bored quickly because of this."
"Of all the games that I own, I can't run this even on Ultra Low. Check my games if you want, you'll see that the majority of them have better graphics than this game, and I run them on Ultra/High. This game is broken, do not buy."
"Not a bad game, I worked out that by editing a file in the game directory it's possible to enable those Intel only FX on any PC. Overall well worth the $8 while it's on sale."
I am not usually a racing game guy but this game is definitely worth a look. Its realistic enough to keep the hardcores happy and easy enough for casuals to jump in.
One of my favourite racing games. I love it. You can choose many different cars which are divided in four classes.
that's feeling of speed
"Very good racing game. It even has splitscreen feature!  In many ways I think this game is better than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, even though Need for Speed has some compelling features and charisma.  I love the menues in Grid 2, because they are fast so I don't get bored. If  there is some information I can always move on as I want. N4S lacked of this.  It's a really creative game with social media, humor and fans. You create a fanbase while competing in your career.  I like the engine sounds in N4S more than in Grid 2, but Grid 2 is really nice anyway.  Grid 2 is more up-to-date, with great online features etc."
"Lots of fun to be had with Grid 2. Builds upon the original GRID and adds better physics, racing elements and features. Not to mention they listened to the community and gave the Derby DLC for FREE! Get racing!"
"I will be honest, I do not like this game but I would still recommend it. I'm not a realist when it comes to my racing games.  I like my racing games with a little more give than Grid 2 provides. With that being said lets get into the meat and potatoes of my review.   The game is very beautiful. Sound and frame rate seems solid enough. The Gimic 'flashback' feels just right and helpful. It takes a lot of the punch out of how real the cars handle. Cars in career look very well for being tuned for racing. I almost lost it when I saw the name 'Fairlady Z.' Sadly it was more modern version and not the S30.  Races are not impossible and with flashback you could win most if not all of them. I just felt like I was driving more than racing. Realism is strong and can pull you out of the speed-buzz you get.  If you are look for realist style racing game then I would recommend Grid 2. I however will not be adding it to my personal collection. I hope this help fill in any thoughts you have. If I can answer any questions, just comment on my review!"
Amazing Game!!!!!! I love it! :D 
"It's hard to say about this game mainly because it's a very good game and the game play, graphics, and cars are great. It's a perfect arcade racer and definitely the game for any driving fan. But here's the problem, Single player is fun and addicting, ask yourself do you like that car?? Guess what you're out of luck because in order to upgrade that car in Single player you need to play online and there's a huge problem with that due to the online is DEAD. No one is online at all so you'll have to play the weekly events if you wish to upgrade the car which if the online was still ALIVE I would recommend buying this game but since it's not. I'll say save your money and buy something else."
"I remember playing grid 1 on my old ps3 and this sequel was a terrific follow up to a great concept about you being a new driver in the professional scene. I highly recommend it to those that want a little something different (*cough, counter strike)"
"It's arcadey as heck, so don't expect a real sim racer, but the game has a lot to offer with its various modes and tracks (can't get enough of the California coastal highways). Online play is solid and entertaining if you can find a decent custom lobby with damage on and flashbacks off or reduced."
I feel like I am driving semi trucks half the time
This game is not the best simulator . But is fun as hell racing is more like drifting around corners more than anything breaking is fine hand breaks are to over powered in most cars at first its hard to get use to but you get the hang of pretty quick   ps  damage system is horrrible
IT DIDNT HAVE A FREE PLAY MODE!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(just buy the original grid 1. not much has changed if anything. its much better
its ♥♥♥♥ing horrible
"GRID 2, if you are already an advanced player in the racing game, I would recommend it for a good graphic, good collection of cars (especially in the reloaded edition, they have a good collection of japanese, european supercar,etc).  But if you are not advanced player in racing games, i would suggest you buying Dirt 3 or other games as this games really forces you to be able to drift. Your first car is a 1970 mustang (RWD | DRIFT) that will drift in case that you slipped in the corner, and until you reach tier 2, you will not face any balanced or grip car. This is very sucks for new player or those who prefer AWD for the time being in racing as this game does not give you options for the car that you will have in your first time."
"such a great game, might wanna use a controller though :/"
"A very good racing game so far, i enjoy the campaign. The bad thing about it is that the multiplayer is dead, that annoys me cause its worth playing."
"I fired the game up and was met with an advertisement saying it recommends I play it with an Intel HD GPU so you can already guess just how excited I was to sink my teeth in to this.  As far as the game goes, it's a very beautiful arcade racer (as opposed to simulation. Whether this is good or bad depends on your personal tastes). The models, the lighting, the sound effects are all on point and they start you off with a half decent vehicle and have you work your way up in to much nicer stuff. There's a fairly basic yet still interesting story that makes you feel like you yourself are working your way up the ranks rather than simply 'YOU BEAT LEVEL ONE. NOW BEAT LEVEL TWO.'  Another thing I should mention is the game has a 'replay' function mid race. If you wipe out, you can simply hit a button and rewind the race about 8 seconds or so and try that part again. Is this very helpful to new players? Yes. Is this a great thing to have on a practice course where you're just trying to work on your cornering and fish-tailing? Very yes. Is this a good thing to have in the actual races? No. Look at it any way you want, it's hand holding and cheating. It's no different from gutter guards at the bowling alley and by having this function, it reenforces that you don't need to actually be good because your mistakes don't matter. It isn't simply 'You screwed up, oh well. I'll let you retry but don't do it again.' You have 3+ rewinds per race. You could argue that your mistakes actually don't matter because it's single player, who cares what you do? Let me come back at this with saying that Single Player should be readying you for competitive play, be it online or when a buddy comes over, or whatever. Maybe I'm just set in my old ways of racing where if you screw up, you start over from the beginning and you keep starting over until you get it right. Your opponents will be waiting for you to slip up so they can over take you and you keep running that track until you have it perfect so that you don't give them that opportunity.  However, everything I mentioned above is rendered null by one thing: stability. I cannot play this game for more than 12 minutes. I have timed it, it's 12 minutes and 14 seconds exactly, every time my screen goes black. I have since found out it has something to do with compatability issues with DirectX 11 but this is a 2013 game, DX 11 had been out for four years before this game's release. Why are we still having these issues? More over, why was this game designed for Intel GPU's? I have since found a workaround but I'm still beyond salty about how I've lost races not because I took a turn to sharp, not because someone else over took me, not because of anything I as a player have done, but simply a black screen."
pretty good... not my cup of tea though.
Very good graphics great gamepay
Sometimes this game is annoying but it's too awesome game thats why i can't hate it x3 10/10♥
Nice ♥♥♥♥ing game!
"Forget the negative views the main thing is it's seriously a lot of fun. The online has some good competitive racing when you're not being smashed to pieces by every other driver. But thats what makes it so fun, the demoltion derby side of things just makes this game hilarous to play with friends."
Very fun game when u drag couple of friends with u into it
"Players are foreced watch slow paced splash screens and videos...they cannot be skipped. I made it through one track before having to ALT+F4 to kill the game, couldn't skip the vids holding things up."
"This. This is a good racing game.  It's not really realistic, but it is great fun!"
"I managed to slide on my roof 5 seconds into my first race on even ground. Basically I´m awful at racing games but i managed to laugh my ♥♥♥ off for 2 hours in multiplayer nevertheless.  Solid racing game, hilariously funny if you suck at it, I´d buy it for 2 euros again."
One of the best racing games
"Best racer on PC I've played so far... A mix of Juiced, Forza, and Need for Speed. Feels real, yet slightly arcadey."
im glad that it was free for the weekend so i did not wastw my money on another codemasters crappy unoptimized games the driving is even WORST than watch dogs codemasters is posion aviod their games at all cost
9/10.. Great racing game with a nicely made career... Crashes very rarely. Love it.
The scenery is nice ....... The game is just bland . A typical racing game I dunno it's ok it's worth it's sale price of 7$ I didn't like it . The cars weren't sexy and the race tracks weren't anything exciting. The driving is fun..That's the one thing they did right. I would recommend you get it on sale. Nothing special about this game in my opinion.
"This game is beautiful let me say that first. The cars and world look great, However; there ain't that meny cars,or maps, and the anouncer says things at times that have nothing to do with whats going on. Like you will start the match and its the count down to start 3, 2, and he says you could took that corner better, lol. aint even started. I picked reommend because it is both fun and chalnging, but there is little replay factor. There is not car part upgrades, just painting, and you cant buy cars you win them. Both things should be in any racing game if you ask me. I so wish GT5 or forza 5 where for PC. Need for Speed Shift is a good one for PC."
Not the best Racing game Not the best car simulator Not the best grid game but its the best of both worlds when its 75% off P.S. (i know theres 3 No's but ill stick to the saying best of both worlds so dont complain)
"Grid 2 is one of the best racing games out there. On PC, it runs very smoothly. You can max out the graphics on nearly any modern computer. The graphics are beautiful and i love customizing cars. In my opinion, better that the Dirt racing games."
But the handling of the vehicles is a bit to get used to.
Good arcade racing game ;)
"Very Great Game,i've played a lot while the game was free,and from what i see the game is awesome :D  the pleasure of doing amazing drifts,high speed (Fact),and playing online with your friends is an awesome experience.I Highly recommend this game.  I'm Brazilian :P"
one of my favorit racing games on steam. also has great eyefinity support.
One of the best driving games I've played in a very long time. I definitely recommend this game to any race game fan.
You did it again Codemasters....you did it again! Hat's off to you!
One of the best racing games out there (console exclusives included). It's great because it still has some kind of story and the racing mechanics just feel good.  8.3/10
"I haven't played a racing game for hours ever since Hot Pursuit. I love how it brings together simulation and arcade gameplay, so yeah. Pretty good."
For a mac user this is the best racing game i've played
"This game just cheating. Different rules for you, differend fot the others.  Shame on you, developers.  I'm going back to play rFactor, TOCA rd, pCARS, Assetto."
Feels like arcade game.. multiplayer is like it is android game....   No drift mode . No cockpit camera . Awesome graphics and light game.. how is that posible?  Minecraft Lags but not grid 2 on ultra settings.. thats amazing!  11/10   
If you can master the drifting in this game. you will feel like a boss and have a great time playing this :)
"Codemasters has slowly built themselves a good reputation. They were once an exploitative company that made some sub-par games, but their acquisition of the Colin McCrae license really pushed them to develop some truly awesome racing games.  While I'm more partial to off-road and rally racing, I do dabble in standard NASCAR/Le Mans style games, too. Sadly, I can't say that Grid 2 offers anything over other racing games to truly justify a purchase.  For starters, the physics are just wack. Sometimes you hit curves and the game will register is as a head-on collision. Other times, you tip a car and go flying through the air. Then there are races where everything works perfectly and you're left wondering why you didn't crash.  The course selection is also pretty lacking. While there are variations of each city, I can't recall more than 12 different tracks. The career mode makes you race the same circuits to a nauseating degree. I'm so sick of being in Dubai (which is saying a lot as I love India).  The career mode, itself, it also just very lackluster. While I understand that deviating too much from standard racing may make this into an extreme sports title, the lack of variance just grates on you after awhile. Couple that with later seasons being bloated beyond reason and I can't even bring myself to finish season 5.  There is no reason why making an event longer should be substituted for actual difficulty. Including different tracks or upgrading cars should be what makes the game harder. Making me do a 7 minute endurance race where the rubber banding AI breaks ahead of me in the last 10 seconds is rubbish.  The car selection is okay. The progression system borrows a lot from the Dirt series in that you gradually unlock better cars by winning events. That takes away a lot of the bologna from games like Forza and Gran Turismo where funds were needed, but it also makes a lot of the beginning cars completely worthless in the end game.  There is a tiny bit of a car customization system, but it is severely lacking. The 'liveries' are familiar in execution to how Need For Speed: Underground allowed you to customize a car, but even that game had the option of tweaking performance and tuning. Grid 2 doesn't have much.  To cap it all off, there isn't even a dashboard viewpoint. You either have a far too close zoom, a too far away zoom, a first person view of nothing, or just your hood. Codemasters' decision was that Grid 2 was more action based, but I don't buy that for a second.  For a racing game to be more action oriented, it should have tight controls. Often times I can't get my car to consistently brake in the same fashion. Other times, I can drift like a master. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to how the game will work.  So is there anything good about the game? Well, the beginning few seasons aren't bad. The races are kept short and different event types are sprinkled throughout. You get some Drift action, a gametype called Togue that is similar to face-off, but requires you don't contact with your opponent and even a cool variant of old-school arcade style racing with Checkpoint.  After the mid-way point, though, the game just forgets about most of these events. You get stuck with standard races and endurance cups that just keep getting longer and longer. It just becomes monotonous and aggravating.  The only way I'd recommend this game is during a Steam sale. At $30, it is far too expensive to just out-right buy. That the DLC is basically just better cars is also garbage, but I guess you could grab those if you want the game to be easier.  Still, there are a ton of better racing games on Steam (Grid Autosport being one of them). You can do a lot better than this strange little game.  5/10"
the turning is to damn sencitive
"Really Cool Racing Game! Like It So Much! Best Refuge After Need For Speed's Death. Gameplay Is So Fun And A Bit Close To Reality, Graphics Are Absolutely Amazing, Just The Only Bad Thing Is That You Have To Pay For DlCs To Get Good Cars Which Means That Those Who Bought DlC's Got A Big Advantage On Those Who Don't Own Them, So This Will Make The Game Unbalanced (Online Races) I Hope That The Developpers Will Think About Balancing The Game Before Fulfilling Their Pockets Next Time!"
"Grid 2 is a great followup on the first Grid. Arcade racing at its best. Great buy, if you ask me! :)"
"10/40 Used Connies, the car doors open when they get damaged. what else can i say"
"The physics in this game must have come from another planet because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. Your car feels like it's made out of paper and opponents charge through you like there's nothing in their way. The cars, especially drift cars like honda nsx, are completely uncontrollable over 200 kmh. You could say that this is realistic but the problem is that your opponents don't seem to have this problem. Even at slow speeds it feels like you are driving on ice and you find yourself struggling to drive in a straight line. Extremely frustrating"
"nice game, but no weather option in this game"
Really Good game. i'd like to recommend it to everyone who about to buy it. pros -great graphics -great gameplay -great multiplayer feature most of all great pc control - i dont even need joystick to play great  cons -lacks cockpit view  this game is a bargain
Awesome racing game of my life man!!!
"Gameplay becomes impossible after Tier 4 since update, Faceoffs cannot be won anymore."
"It may lack a lot and easily make you rage, but this is still a great looking PC racer that is fun to drive and has the best crashing detail ever. Best of all is the amount of locations in the game you can visit, just look at this game like NFS with drifting and demolition derby :D"
It Is a fun fast paced arcade style racing game!
Fun but not worth the $30
"The game is great, and if you like sereal racing games, this is it. I also love how practicing makes my driving better."
"All things considered, the game's kinda meh. The game's A.I. is appalling, what I mean by that is: when cornering the A.I. won't recoginze that you, the player is there, they will generally just turn straight into you. which for a racing game that is largely centered around single player racing WITH A.I.; is not ideal. The steering, and I say this from experience with a wheel, I have a Logitech MoMo, isn't great, especially when drifting, as the amount of countersteer needed to turn out of a drift is extremely inconsistent, and trying to 'steer a drift' with precision is damn near impossible. That pretty well sums up the flaws that I've noticed. I would say that the game in general is pretty much inferior to the first game in these respects. As far as the price tag goes, it's not worth $29.99. I was lucky enough to pick it up on a humble bundle some time ago; on that, or on an extreme discount is what I would recomend picking the game up for, if you decide to give it a try."
tip top
"A lot of fun for any fans of racing games. I'm a relatively casual fan of racing games and enjoyed this game very much, until 'season four' of the single player mode. I was playing on medium difficulty. I was consistently getting first in all my races in seasons 1-3, then in season 4 the difficulty ramped up for some reason and it became tedious. You literally have to race perfect in order to win the races, and the cars are much faster so they are less forgiving. I had to do races over and over to get them right and it just became not fun. I set the game to easy to finish out season 4 because I thought that was the end of the game, turns out there is a season 5 and at that point, things had become so monotonous that I uninstalled. Still, the game is worth it for the first 15-20 hrs overall."
GET F**KED M8 i got this sh*t when it was free and played once next day says i have to pay for it like you wot m8 ill rek you m9
"It's a Great Game, I Recommend it, worths its price, great quality graphics and gameplay /physics, I really dont udnerstand why so much hate and negative reviews from others. One negative is that there's not much people playing online and if you are higher level sometimes you can be get kicked often from other hosts which makes you most times go back to single player/carrier mode.  A good way is to find other skilled players to you level and send a friend request to have someone to play with. "
"Grid 2 falls way behind either Gran Turismo or Forza in terms of vehicle control, its unresponsive and sluggish compared to the first Grid which I'd rather play than this. After playing Grid 2 I have serious reservations about buying and playing Grid Autosport"
"Do not ge this game! I have been a avid player of GRID and had loads of fun drifting and open wheeling around. In GRID 2 they have taken 8 steps backwards. The physics are absolute crap, they charge you extra for any cars you would really want, and the tracks are porrly designed and way way way too short. Save your money and anger and buy the first GRID. The drifting in this game (which was heavly advertised) is so damn horrible, i really can't complain enough. Dear lord do not buy this game. Codemasters you have failed the car/racing community. God you guys really messed this series up."
♥♥♥♥ 
"Grid 2 is not a step up from the original Grid. It is more like an update. Little graphical improvements, different tracks etc. It is too expensive as a full price stand alone.  Apart from that there are a couple of big negative things to say:  - Driving mechanics got worse. The original Grid is a favorite of mine, because it has a great balance between simulation and arcade style driving. There's a great feel to the cars. You can almost feel the body, power and motor. Screeking tires in the corners. Somehow in Grid 2 you have to drift in every corner. If you don't drift, you lose. There is no real cornering. If you try to drive your car like a real car you will fail.  - Online: This was the reason for me to get this game. I wanted to play Grid online. Sadly the online play is bad. You will be crashed into constantly. The most common strategy in online play seems to be trying to bump and crash other player of track. No driving skills are involved in regualr online play. It's a frustrating experience. You try to drive correctly, get the corner perfectly, only to be crashed into by a driver behind you that then instantly pushes the reset button and will turn out ahead of you, because he reset before you had to to.  Online play is broken. And that was supposed to be the reason to upgrade from Grid 1. My verdict is: stick to Grid 1 or get this game if it is heavily discounted.   A sad, sad thing. :("
"great racing game, with lovely graphics"
"I'd rather drive a bar of soap over the sweaty back of a hairy fat guy. Nonsense cars wtih no tuning (race, street, drift - drift being the most predictable). Horrible waiting times on menus. Uninstalled after free weekend."
A Great Game to play alone or online. Only complaint is the lack of level variety.
"Things I´ve learned from this game:  -Japanese cars are always faster than any other -Drifting the ideal raceline is faster than normally driving it -If you´re driving according do normal rules (DTM, F1 p.ex.) you´re not gonna win. Car to car contact is needed, although it will affect the performance of your car-&gt; you´ll have to learn your car carefully. That´s probably the reason why my most used car is the Nissan Silvia S15 or the BRZ untill now (WSR Season 2) through all the events where i could choose my car. (Tip: BRZ for racetracks, Silvia for 'Street Races') -Drifting needs a lot more driving skill than NFS said. -Don´t play racing games at night time; You ARE gonna rage at the A.I., I promise; speaking of my own experience right now :D Still a very fun game for casual racer guys. If you are into simulations, I´m not really sure, it is pretty realistic but you can obviously trick the physics somehow by going sideways. I turned off all help and stuff with only 5 resets or something, but still it seems to have wider limits than a sim.  Overall it´s still a great balance between arcade and simulation and I love it. I like race games like NFS, but NFS has gone to whatever the ♥♥♥♥, maybe ♥♥♥♥ or something and Grid2 just feels really like I think racegames for casual gamers should feel. So if you´re tired of too much realism or tired of NFS because NFS is ♥♥♥♥, this is the game to go with, although there are no cops in it."
It manipulates user's play badly. Super mario is better to recommend than this.
Awesome game have to buy it.
"Honestly, not great. I'm used to playing f1 and need for speed (particularly most wanted) compared to them the physics engine is disappointing and was a real let down. If buying this again I wouldn't now do it. But if you like ultra sensitive and damaging engines then this is the game ofr you but in my opinion it is bad."

"I have spent many years playing racing games from the arcade style Need for Speed series to the in depth Gran Turismo series, which is by far my favorite. I no longer play console games, I'm strictly PC. That means I'm searching for a game which can satisfy my Gran Turismo need. I own several racing games for PC such as Grid 1, Shift 2, Dirt series, Need for Speed, and I only use an Xbox One controller. Grid 2 has become my goto racing game when I have time to sit down and spin some tires.  I have heard that Shift 2 is better, but so far I have not been able to get into it. After work and time with my family, I don't have a lot of time for gaming. So when I finally have a moment to race, Grid 2 is where I turn.   Gamepad control works well, it is challenging enough to keep me engaged while not being so realistic that I get frustrated since I don't have a wheel. The visuals are excellent and that includes vehicle damage. Plenty good enough to please my tastes."
"this is great and challenging game, the graphics are amazing, so are the physics but the only problem is i cant get it to work with my steering wheel properly, hopefully they will make it steering wheel compatible (my steering wheel is a logitech G27)"
"Get GRID 1 instead, it's more fun."
"When I first heard of Grid 2 I thought cool as I've played Grid then I loaded it and there are less controls in G2 than Grid. The steering was so bad I could only get 10 feet down track b4 hitting and bouncing off the walls. In Grid you can adjust the steering sensitivity. I haven't tried the game now in over a year and hope it's been fixed. After tweeking the controler I was able to get 15 feet down track, WOW. I just bought a Xbox controler for windows and giving that a try b4 I delete GRID2 from my life."
"10/10 This is the best racing game I've ever played. The realistic car controls feel great, making the races much more difficult than Burnout, Forza, or Need for Speed. The campaign is the best of any racing game ever, because it not only feels more realistic, but it offers variety and options of how to do it, with many extra features. The online play is well-made, really the CS:GO of racing. It's quick, punishing, and requires honing your skills. No mouse support does drag this otherwise amazing game down, along with it being a bit of a CPU hog. Don't get me wrong, it runs, and has good graphics, but the graphics to memory ratio isn't great. Overall, I can't recommend this game enough."
So recommend. Such race. Many simulate. 10/10
One of the better racers around
its a good game but hard to find player in multiplayer 
"the graphics are really well from the detail of the tires to the fans on side lines.the handling of the cars was a little difficult to get the hang of.online for pc is kind of a bust not having that many people involved and a lot of the players ive raced favor smashing people into walls instead of racing with a concios.it is hard for a true enthusiest to find a game worth playing,especially since nfs fell off.its far from perfect,it could have tuning options like forza.also it could have added a more open approach to liveries instead of fixed ones.the car handling could be a bit more user friendly for less progressive drivers.i see where others opinions are coming from with the dislikes,this game does have shortcomings.ultimately this game is a lot of fun to play,it has its own way of challenging others abilities unlike shift and shift 2 where the physics were so warped i dont see how it could get worse and i grew up to nfs1 2 3 underground 1 n 2 most wanted etc.,by the time carbon came out i lost faith in nfs eventhough i snagged pro street and shifts.i havent been able to push myself to that extra step until i reached grid 2 and its a pain playing with lousy drivers that turn it into halo.i like this game,i recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge,the fell of the cars is tricky at first,it does make sense though,when turning corners if theres too much throttle it ends in a spin out.its worth the money to people that enjoy racing."
Good racing game... but too many dlc
"Probably the worst racing game I've played. I've played a lot of racing games. But anyways.  Pros: Good Graphics Good Sound Ok Storyline Challenging   Cons: Worst AI Ever (Like N64 AI IS BETTER) Cars apparently have their tires drenched in oil Half of the cars in DLC Can't Skip Cutscenes   Many more problems.  Don't waste your money, Buy something better"
"If you liked the first GRID game you'll probably like this one too, there are a few major differences tho, in this one you don't earn money and buy your cars, you just get them handed to you, and can get more cars through racing, and there's no team racing element in this either."
"An awesome game that I really enjoy playing! The story is nice, the gameplay is nice, overall I would reccomend this game !"
"good game ,but more car more good :v"
"I would recommend this game to all the people that are a fan or racing. Grid 2 has cars from different tiers, so lets say you like classic cars and another likes sports cars. Grid 2 includes all of that, especially the realistic crashing and racing graphics. The details are what make a game popular, and this game shows a potential chance of that happening for first-time players."
i mean its your money spend it as you please
"I had a brief experience with Grid 2  This negative review I want to preface is for the attention of people not regular to the racing genre whom may want to get a rare fix and are thinking of this game to get that done  Don't.  There's better out there for our kind  So the asshat narrator is useless for a start - 'catch your back end', 'balance your speed' that's all he's got for me - how about tell me what button combinations to press at which speeds  This was after the first warning flag had reared its ugly head though, the first achievement pops and it’s titled “Here’s my number, Call me maybe?”   I don’t have any problems with that scene, it’s not mine, there’s a good chance that if the racing genre isn’t part of your regular sensibilities then a game that makes those kinds of references may just annoy you too  Finally I am having a mess around the test track and I decide I’m done for my first session (at this point fairly sure I’ll at least play it one more time) when the game throws me into an unskippable cutscene like somehow their video of their schmuck stock racing character is so good that it demands my time with no option of me bypassing it  It was at this point that I decided Grid 2 is a game that is not meant for me, which means there’s a chance that it might be a game that's not meant for you either"
"When purchasing grid 2, I had expected a serious racing game, like how grid 1 had the sponsoring, lemans, and all the official racing events, and when I walked into grid 2, all I got was an arcade-like drift racer. I'm very dissatisfied with the game, nor can I get a refund because I spent an hour and a half trying to get it to run on my computer, then another hour trying to find the more serious events. I recommend only for someone looking for a drift racing game. It's excellent in that regard, but not for a simulation game."
"If you liked Grid: race driver, its's like that but harder. I think."
"Incrediblle game! I've been playing it for a long time, and I STILL LOVE IT!!! The storyline is great, and takes a while to complete. That's why it's fun for 100s of hours! And even when it's done, you can play it over again as someone else! Also, you can run it on loads of computers, and it still runs amazingly well! Loads of cars, loads of types of races, loads of EVERYTHING! I highly reccomend it to ANYONE! Literally ANYONE! Also, if you have a gamepad, then it's a lot eaiser. Great game for anyone! MUST-HAVE!"
"Controls are horrid, physics are terrible, and thinks that going sideways is the fastest way to go around a corner"
Its a ♥♥♥♥ game graphics on the cars are good but the other particles are ♥♥♥♥ :/
Very happy
Not impressed. Not my type of racing game. To many American cars at the start which are very loose and tail happy.
"I would reccomend this, however i want more cars and not all dlc. otherwise I like it."
"The arcade racing is pretty weak, but the game is really beautiful"
"GRID 2 is a highly arcade racing game, you won't find any real simulations that obey laws of phisics here. Having this said, If you're into that cup of cha, you'll be delighted to play it.  + amazing graphics + interesting career mode + the feel of speed  - handling can be pretty awkward at times  8/10"
"I remember Grid 1 being a lot of fun. This on the other hand feels... very new age tween gamer.  Twiddling with the forced intro race, and trying to setup a Simraceway wheel (which was unmanagable), the entire grid finished the small circuit before I even started moving... and yet when I finished I received that annoying poitive reinforcement nonsense that is the reason why kids today are self entitled morons. Horribly late finish = OMG, that was amazing, all eyes were on you, that generated so much interest.  Forced, unskippable cutscenes = Check Decent though generic to Codemasters handling = Check (didn't feel engaging like Grid 1 did at the time)  And the visuals... lens flared street lamps during the day? That's just a cheap way out to add bells and whistles to an otherwise overglossed and unbalanced/unrefined art style.  All of those things are initial markers of what the game really is. Disposable and forgettable. I've played more than enough titles over the years to know that feeling of mediocrity at the start of a game that is just going to stay mediocre, at best.... and this is one of them."
"this game is terrible: -its hard to control the car, every car is like the roads are covered in ice.  -limited amounts of flashbacks -the menus, ugh -No music, come on.   pros: great graphics, but that's it."
"Really fun for the first 5-6 hours, but when you get to drive the 'real' cars, the bad drifiting mechanics make you throw your controller onto the next wall."
2/10
"Very realistic and fun game, should definately play if you enjoy racing games."
Amazing game! Online full of rammers but still great but the SLR and AGERA cars could be GRIP cars
"The developers of this game know I suck at driving, so they put in a rewind feature.   9/10"
This is a full throttle driving simulator no sunday drivers welcome here quality game
"The story mode in this racing game is like many, okay. You can name the character, and take controle in the drivers seat. The best costimising in the game is for the cars, you can do so much to them and it is great."
"After buying GRID 1, I feel like I should change my opinion about this game.  Compared to GRID 1, this feels like the Shortened Version of GRID 1. No cockpit view, the narrator is terribly tedious, less cars, extremely lack of car customisation. AI in both games are stupid, but since GRID 2 is newer, I really expect the AI to be a lot better, nope, not one bit however. This game is not a racing simulator anymore, its just an arcade racing game, unrealistic. The money system is replaced with a fan earning stuffs. It's not really fun you cannot use the fans you earned to do other things like buying vehicle, it's pointless.  This game is really good; I really tried to like the game, got all DLCs, but no. It lacks too much thing in the game, and I refused to like the game. Buy it only when it's on a huge sale."
"Nice racing game, too casual for me but still nice 7/10"
"Very fun game! Especially if you are playing with your friends and not only driving to win, but also destroy eachother and have fun!"
Amazing game! cars look great and the driving is fast pace. worth the money if you are in to old style racing games...  9/10!!
Really cool game. I like the racing mechanics and the tracks. I would recommend it if you're in to racing.
Not a big fan of driving game but get boring very quickly.
"one of the worst 'simulation' car games i have played for long time sensivity, not possible to adjust, as settings doesnt take any effect ] sterring wheel ] oponents are unbreakable, but they can smash and drive trough you no problem strongly not recommended for anyone, i want my money back"
Grid 2 is a truley good game! My only problem is online gamers who use the ps3 pads and xbox controllers! they enjoy pressing the reset to track button when ever they run into trouble! so on that basis its a let down.   My ideal racing online mode would be to join a group that enjoys the collisions being on but respect for the other drivers without cheating in someway! 
"This is a really good, solid racing game. GRID 2 is fast-pased, speedy and exiting driving experience. I never imagine that passing someone would be so much fun! The driving is thrilling and racing makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The graphics are a big plus too, beautiful landscapes and lens flares look really astonishing. Unlike getting more exp you get more fans, which is pretty unique and fun thing to have. The whole athmosphere of the game is so uplifting and, in a sertain way, relaxing that it had to be mentioned. If there would be any bad thing to say about this, it would defintelty be the difficulty of this game. This is a quite hard racing game even in a most easiest settings, especially for those with no racing game experience.  Other than that, GRID 2 is easily above average racing game, with fantastic graphics and athmosphere.  3/5 The scenery was so beautifull that i accidentaly drove of the cliff"
NIce game
"First of all, this developer has succeed to manage the storyline, making a racing game more intense with it. Truly beautiful work. Graphic quality isn't bad for a 2013's released game, and the engine sounds is pretty impressive. Hearing how the tires squeaking in the race really forming a race atmosphere. But compared to Dirt series, (which is well known as rally games and the tires rarely to meet asphalt road) Grid 2 really has an oversteering issue, I don't think my skill is questionable in here. I have playing many many of racing games, but this one, I don't know, it just feel weird for me racing above the asphalt road and found my car oversteering excessively. It's like driving over muddy streets, and makes me wondering 'a well made car like Koenigsegg Agera has this bad quality of traction?' to this point, your realistic racing simulation are really questionable, Codemaster. The last thing what I hate the most is, where the hell is the cockpit perspective? Do u really think you can feel a Pro atmosphere in a racing circuit without a cockpit perspective? That's a shame. I say NO for this one, only for this one."
another code masters game with lack of steering wheel support.  I don't buy car racing games to play with my keyboard you know.   I uninstalled after this review. What a disapointment.
Good visuals [+1] Good car mechanics [+1] Good gameplay [+1] FUN 10/10
less fun than the first one. It s just a correct driving game. i dont recommand this game at full price
Never trust your gamemates! 96/69
I liked it so much that I have played it four times so far. I can say that it is better than Grid Autosport.
If you want a good racing game buy ''Racedriver Grid'' and not Grid 2 or 3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I realy like to play online but this serwer is only offilne Who like to play with me pls invite me
Pros:  + Decent graphics  Cons:  - Horrible physics - Rubber Band A.I. - No cockpit view - Online is all about wrecking each other - You need to buy DLCs to have any cars to choose from when you play online   Conclusion: This game is alright if you enjoy arcade racers like NFS.
"Game is not bad, but quickly becomes boring to play."
"This game sucks, there's like 30 people playing this game world wide, no joke there is only 2-3 rooms everytime i search for online game, and most of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that crushes intentionally. and if you buy car packs be prepared that you wont be able to use some of the cars"
great speed motion game .
crashes every 15 minutes i cant complete a race please fix
"This game is a lot of fun, but often the online is bad with few people. But the singleplayer is one of the best in a racing game. The physics are good but many of the cars feels arcady to drive. The game is fun to play but feels a bit arcady compared to the newest GRID game Grid Autosport."
worest game ever when it comes to relatity - complete joke
Stop looking at this and find the first GRID.
"Not as much fun as the first Grid and definitely not as much content. Too much concentration on Touge and Drift racing instead of the track side of things.  If you're looking for an arcadey game i'd still recommend if it's in a sale, anything more serious and i'd suggest staying away from it. Either way, definitely not Codemasters best effort.  3/5"
horrible its so laggy now i cant even play a simple game
"The handling is beyond a joke. I used to be very much into racing games, but I have no idea how anyone is able to play this. Feels like you're constantly driving on ice."
80 deg on stock cooler..ati hd 5770..full load easy to lost control of the car..  10/10 would play after rig upgrade
a racing with a combination of street racing and GT racing. really impresive. with a great graphic.
A racing game with a lot of tracks and a good amount of cars (though more are added by DLCs). Controls are arcade. No cockpit camera view is available.   8/10
"No cockpit view, but great graphics and easy to use arcade stlye handling and physics make this game fun!"
"Ever since I left my xbox 360, I've been looking for a racing game to replace the Forza Motorsport series. This one comes very close."
"Meh, missing the European races. I'm not interested in American racing."
Racing on ice O_o
Very fun and easy to play!
Great game!
"Great driving game, with a weird funny plot and amazing graphics! Not a complete winner though. A bit loose driving with both the Xbox gamepad and Logitech Driving Forge GT. More tight handling when driving balanced cars. But you start with drift cars so you should expect to crash quite many times in the beginning."
"We have only had this game for a few days, but it keeps us playing it to get to the next round. At times there is screen problem, even with a 144 hz setup. The game can be fun once you get used to the controls and start winning the races on Very Easy. It's a nice game to kill time with and it's not overly complicated. Graphics are beautifully done, but sometimes they break up during the race. Courses do provide a welcome break from a circular race track."
"The graphics are better than Grid1 but the gameplay is pretty similar while driving but with less choice in what sort of races you do. Grid gives a alrge choice in the events to do next, grid 2 makes the choice very limited.  Also it keep crashing for me. I win a 3 stage event then the game crashes on the results page. After restarting you are classed as DNF on the event and have to do the whole thing again.  Buy grid 1 instead. The graphics are not quite as good but it's cheaper, is a great game and it doesn't crash all the time and cause frustration."
"So contrary to the negative reviews, I love this game. I picked up this game just yesterday on sale and it's the best 7 bucks I have ever spent. I see a lot of people saying that this game is all about drifting, and it isn't. Yes it's a big pat but you can easily make those turns by simply hitting the break and slowing down and make the turn and keep up with the competition.   I love this game because to me it is more arcade like in terms of steering the car. The graphics are amazing. I only have GTX 760 and I can play the game on Ultra. The car selection and customazation is not the greatest but enough to satisfy. Overall this is probably the best 7 bucks I spent on steam."
"This game s poor you can change paint job but you cant ♥♥♥♥ing tune a car what the hell the ai drives on roads more easy than the player if they bump you,you can spin out of control or crash man f i see anyone that made this game we Throwing Hands!!!!"
Online is dead 
Grid 2 is a positive step up from grid improving on graphics and racing physics! awesome game!
this games controls are like gran turismo turned up to level 7 sensivity and when you think youve mastered the controls you suddenly reilised youve just crashed into a rock overall i think this game should have handling like forza or need for speed but it doesnt so its terrible
"I hate grid 2 for a lot of subjects. First of all it hasn't got any new ideas between the first episode. Second mistake is the deadly boring gameplay for 20 hours. The difficulty in the game is a joke. In easy at the last season i dont have to win anything easily.  Every track (5-8?) is 1:25s long. Lot of different cars, but why? My favourite is the promo event. For 7 minutes i have to drive circle around. :S AND: the horribe AGGRESSIVE drivers. I cant image that in the real life the drivers hit the rivals at 320km/h. The theory of relativity: the phisics on me are different that on my rival. Driving simulator? Without inner camera? Absolutly not entertaining."
Awesome racing game! I like when you go back in time... or how it's called....rewind....i don't know!
Great game. Enjoyed a lot.
"This is a pretty decent racing game. Not a lot of fine tuning that you'll find in other simulators, but the racing is solid. My only complaint was the push to drift, since I'm not into drifting at all."
Awesome Arcade Racer!
One of the best racing games ive played. Altho i wouldnt mind to be able to customize the cars a bit more !
Great game from codemasters! Looks great as well. Not a full racing simulation game but I think is what makes it a little more fun to play!
"This game is great. Lets get the obvious points out of the way though. This game is GORGEOUS and even runs well on my crappy laptop, which is always a plus. And the gameplay is brilliant. I highly suggest a gamepad, just like for any racing game. Analog controls are great for racing games, but this one has fairly decent keyboard controls as well. The saving grace for this game which pushes it over the top of other racing games of this quality is the flashbacks. Though not as good in multiplayer, the flashbacks are absolutely brilliant in Singleplayer, allowing you to learn from your mistakes as you go along with the race. Also means that you won't have to go to the menu every time you have a big crash. Overall, this is a very well-polished racing game with some great features that makes it better than others. 8.5/10 for Singleplayer 7.5/10 for Multiplayer"
Almost bought this before...thank god i didnt....first thing i expect from games that have duel option is the possibility to knock competion out...not hit a brick wall....its a brick wall game...pretty but sad game.
"GRID, you went all Burnout and DLC on us. Why the ♥♥♥♥ did you go Burnout and DLC on us? You basically took GRID 1 and all it stood for, and spat on it. At least you made things a little better with GRID Autosport. I hope you've learnt your lesson."
"It was one of my favorite racing games until I reached the end-game part. Towards the end, it gets very repititive. A complaint I often see with this game is the handling, like how all the cars are so extremely drifty and what not. I was able to deal with this and I for the most part mastered the controls, but near the end all you're given are supercars which are just AWFUL to drive. I get that it's an arcade-y video game, but these cars are just a chore to control. I used to enjoy this game greatly, but nowadays I just can't play it without getting angry at the awful controls the supercars have."
wow graphics in the low spec (only on Intel HD) #evillaught
"You cannot NOT drift in this game. Get the first game instead, for your own sake."
Awesome game! I love everything!!
hit a piece of grass and my car broke down
if you have friends to lay with it is awesome but i would like to see the game where the dont slide out in every corner
one of the most best car game I've ever played. I recommend this game to everyone who like cars
"What a nice racing game ( I also love it because it support with Mac OS X hahahaha)! Hope some Formula One racing cars will appear in this game, that will be better."
this sucks more than the demo
"For me even 3 years after release, the game is very beatiful and amazing to play, Codemasters roxxx!"
"I simply cannot understand why this game can be this uncontroable. Code Master had made so many good racing games. All kind of racing simulator. Formula one, WTCC, and. In this game there is no grip in all the car. You will see indy car slid and drift through corner. What the front wing is just a displacement, and does not do anything. Because of this, you will see all the AI gonna crash into in almost all the corner all the time."
"For me this is just a super fun game. really. Except for the last drift challenge (I struggled a little with previous ones) I finished all the championship stages in 4/5 difficulty. The game is really fun. The cars are just AWESOME. The gameplay is intense and fast. The damage is pretty real and really affects your driving. If it is a simulation like GT? no. If it is as arcade as NFS? no. I don't think so.  It sits in a middle ground that is just super fun. Again, the opponents and the real and AWESOME cars that you can drive and decorate (not really customize) is just great. I really liked the available cars.  The Skyline is awesome, the Mclaren is super fast, the corvette is just all power............ and.... Speed an acceleration take on a new perspective when you drive the Koenisegg Agera R.. JUST SO MUCH FUN!!!   The tracks look amazing, the game modes are very different and gives you enough to worry about. It looks so good I have a lot of in game screenshots, of landscapes, cars, sliding cars, crashes, etc...  So, I rate it on the fun scale something like a 8/10 at least ;)"
"I recommend this game only under two conditions: If it's cheaper than it's current price (at this time, $30,) and if you don't mind a game that is more of an arcade race than one with a story (which a lot of racing games are.)  To me, Midnight Club: LA was the best racing game I'd ever played. A full city to race around free roaming with a decent story and actual characters with faces to get behind. You don't get that here. You do get an above average racer though (minus some issues with braking) with a decent selection of cars and a not too shabby customization. Again, not on the level of Midnight Club, but it's decent. There is somewhat of a story here, a young newbie trying to get respect on the streets and clubs. There's no free roaming or actualy people to see in the game though, from what I saw.  Again if the game is about half it's price it's a decent game if you need to scratch a racing itch, and since the Deluxe Edition of Midnight Club LA isn't on steam as of this time, I would say this game is an ok racer."
Do not buy this game if your looking for a simulation game for your racing wheel. It works well with a controller but not a wheel. It's almost undrivable when using a wheel. It also sucks that you start with a overpowered Mach 1 Mustang with bald tires. It's alright if your using a controller though.
"Now that I completed the game, the game is great! But,sometimes cars dirft too much (depend what car) but for me isn't that bad. But, the game is awesome, I bought on a sale for $7.49. So, for me was well spend."
"Casual racing game is what I expected, but became disappointed and will not play this again. The physics of the game are such that the car takes impossible beatings, fine, that's kind of what we expect in a casual race game. I'm glad I don't completely smash my car when I run into a car beside me or a guard rail on a curve. However, when I run into a simple street sign that stops the car dead in its tracks, it's very frustrating, especially in a limited time race. Very poor insight for a race game.   The physics of this genre make it fun, this game isn't fun. I would have refunded but bought it in advance during a sale and played it later on."
"good game, love it, would buy if there's another game like that, or if they just relesed Grid 3."
"Boy am I glad I did not buy this game when it was first released, I bought it today and only paid around $7.50 for the damn thing and as far as I am concerned I wish I had not even spent this amount on it. I am new to racing games and this one was a very poor choice for me even at the 7 dollars spent for it. The reason? There are no tutorials or practice sections in the game. When you first start the game you are put right in a race, no time to even figure out how to drive the damn car etc. It is probably ok for an experienced gamer who has played a lot of these race games but stay away if you are new to race games. Even though I paid for this I am going to uninstall the local content so it does not take up storage space, I only wish there was a way to permanently remove the game entry in my game library and if I thought I stood a chance of getting a refund I wold ask for one."
"Fun game when you can play it. one of the most unfriendly games I have ever used. you just want to play but it doesnt let you you cannot just play a game,and you can be waiting ages before it gives you anything playable"
"horrible game, it is really fun until the save file becomes corrupt or the game decides to restart you from the beginning. DO NOT BUY"
Another great GRID game. Nice graphics and when you choose to make the gameplay hard it really gets hard. Do play it with a steering wheel (works fine)  Really consider this game
Comparred to other Codemaster games like grid1 and dirt3 this is not as good. 7/10
One of my favorite racing games for sure. i was looking for a really good NFS but was getting mixed reviews.. this is like NFS and a slight bit of Forza but definitley closer to NFS. The physics of this game are fenominal not to mention the graphics are crystal clear (macbook pro retina display). definitly a great buy
"Very entertaining. I will never regret these 20$. Only negative is that on-line community is slowly dying. There are always the same players, but that's kinda good. On-line races almost always demand from you pure skill to beat your's opponents. For me 8,5/10"
"The feel of the cars is great and accurate for each type they are classified in, but the selection is extemely lacking without buying a cash grab DLC to play anything other than small handful of cars in the base game."
Awesome game that is true. I'm just confused from corner cutting detector like wtf... I cut corner and nothing and when I pass corner rly nice I get slowed by that ♥♥♥♥. Yeah and buy game with all DLC's. Without them u won't be able to complete all the achievements.
"After spending nearly twice as much time in Forza Horizon 3 I can say without shadow of a doubt this is a better racing game. The cars each have a learning curve and driving itself is a challenge where the reward is better handling. It doesn't have an open world map, it doesn't have a giant selection of cars, and it doesn't have Toyota ( :(((( ) but what Grid 2 does have is incredible sound design, damage models, handling, aesthetic (to a degree) and an overall better feel. It takes me back to the early 2000s sense of wonder and challenge that I felt playing the first four Gran Turismo games on the Playstation and Playstation 2. I can't say the same for Codemasters' newest title Dirt Rally since it's almost impossible to play with a controller, but if Dirt Rally's sound design, graphical fidelity and damage models are any signal of how the next Grid will be my wallet is already prying itself apart to shell out the proper amount of shekels. Get Grid 2 for a fun racing game and especially for the Touge element. Get the next Grid that ever comes out if you want to nut harder than you've ever nutted before."
Nice racing game. Some cars are hard to handle in fullspeed and rollover too easily from bumps.
Good arcadey race game. Plenty of tracks and cars to choose from.
I'm writing this review for the badge but man I know this game is dead but can you add an AE86 please I mean it's a drifiting game other than that love this game I can either drift or play it like burnout and ram the hell out of everyone
"On the whole there is much to recommend this game, but I think it is not in any way a racing game for the novice or hobby racing aficianado. Tracks are beautiful, the sound is fantastic, race modes are surprisingly diverse and engaging, course layout is well-balanced and challenging, but there are a few significant shortcomings that easily-frustrated racers will struggle with. AI is atrocious and will run you over in the pursuit of their racing line, any collision with AI vehicles will remove all steering capacity from your car until you disengage (meaning you will have to brake as the AI won't do so to disentangle itself), and the game's inexplicable career decision to constantly shift you between disciplines and vehicle classes will rapidly grow weary. It is almost impossible to develop any kind of racing groove when you are boomeranged between track toys, drift cars, and heavy upper class vehicles that steer like couches. And then the shuddering camera - evidently set that way to give the sensation of car vibration and sway - will give you fits if you suffer from any kind of motion sickness. In the chase view, and especially racing at night, the sway becomes infuriating and actively impedes developing skill and consistency. The handling can be an issue, too, but with practice you will get a solid handle on how cars respond to steering inputs, and indeed the (unalterable) steering sensitivity comes to make sense with time.   In the end, the game is excellent, but is perhaps not suitable (re: fun) for gamers not familiar with its quirks and oft-puzzling handling/viewing designs. The difficulty slider can only help with the competitiveness and timing of the AI and cannot help with those issues that are most likely to cause the greatest frustrations: camera shudder, collision detections, and erratic career arc.  Mac-specific notes: the game performed fine - and indeed better than most Codemasters titles have for me! - crashing to desktop only 1 time. Menus are easy to negotiate and understand, although there is no slider to adjust steering sensitivity and linearity. On just a few races there was significant screen-tearing as well as general hiccups on loading screens, but for the most part these did not influence the game negatively.  EDIT: after further time with the game, new issues which have resulted in its removal from my installed library - without finishing the game campaign - have popped up. The WSR in Asia section offers a mix of race types with restricted car selection; many of these vehicles are 'grip' RWD which behave in unpredictable ways. The light track toys, for example, will sometimes drift as instructed and on other sweeping turns will not. Combining unpredictable handling response with downhill driving at high speeds and ridiculous amounts of camera shake ended with me terminating the game. Speeds that would result in my car being unable to steer were met by the AI with no issue at all, in fact the AI gained speed on some corners! The difficulty spike is understandable, but I have zero desire to grind seconds off of long, twisting races where I cannot guarantee that handling will remain the same upon application of braking and throttle. And elimination races with drift cars became simply tedious; starting in 9th with a drift car that you can not drift with - because contact with any other racer causes you to lose all steering regardless of contact point - makes it less a race and more a demo derby. The game is still recommended, but only to racers of sufficient patience and understanding to deal with the game's plethora of puzzling design schemes."
I did this for the badge.
"After a few hours (~50-60 hours) I think could write a review for this products too: I Love It and hate it. Multiplayer easily can ♥♥♥♥ off [there are soooo many wreckers].  //After 1220 hours: sadly nothing's changed - german cheaters, wreckers and anti-fair players... //But --- SOMETIMES! --- we have a good times with good &amp; fair players in the lobby. That's why I stayed in this community yet."
"I compare this game to Mario Kart Wii, Why you ask? Because most people like a game they can master ( Yes you can master Mario Kart Wii), but its pretty hard to master, but once you do you'll love it even though im sure some people use this game to just goof off in, crash cars, and just flat out have fun! To tell you the truth thats all I did in this game for about a year (Don't worry it wasn't online) and I had a blast! I think Codemasters took out driving assists in Grid 2 to just create a new type of racing game or now that I think about it completely reverse how nearly every other racing game is. For example Forza, Gran Turismo ect. all those game are about hitting the apex of each turn perfectly and making sure to put on the brakes at the exact right time. Well in Grid 2 its just about the oppsosite you still want to to get a good angle on a turn but if you haven't already noticed you are meant to drift around every turn and if you don't like that DO NOT buy this game! because its all you do in it!   If you are looking to buy this game. 1. MAKE SURE TO GET THE DEMO FIRST! 2. Get it and its DLC when it goes on sale (Cause it gets pretty cheap)  Also playing with the keyboard is pretty good, but a Xbox 360 controller (or somthing like it) is recommended."
"This game is awesome, highly recommend a steering wheel"
It's a mix between Arcade and Sim racing with a nice damage system and great car selection.
"Not bad, but not the best racing game. If it's on sale, pick it up. If not, save your money for NFS Hot Pursuit or Dirt 3"
"Night of fire, you've better better stay  You've better better begin the prayer to play  Night of fire, come over over me  Come over over the top you'll have a night of fire  "
It's nice for an arcade game.
Wow! Such driving! Such graphic! Such cars! :D Awesome racing game
this game is too much fun i just wish i could get it to work with my G27
Most arcade style racing game i've ever played. Even Toon Car is more realistic than that...
"I would recommend that you only buy this game when it's on sale, and expect to only play single player unless you have some friends that have this game, then it can be really fun. The multiplayer is pretty much dead because bugs and Codemasters did not have any form of anti cheat in the begining few months of this release. It got very ugly racing online. It was not fun at all, and our cries for bans and a anti cheat seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. To be honest, the first GRiD was far superior to this game in every aspect. But like I said, buy it when it goes on sale, it's still worth getting."
Solid racing game. Not as many cars as Gran Turismo or Forza but not bad. Gets a little reptetive towards the end. Wait to get it on sale.
Great game. Slick racing. Still think first game is better though. 8/10.
"While I prefer racing games more like Forza Motorsport, this is still a fun game. I enjoy the career mode, as it has you doing different types of racing. Whether it's a normal race grid, a head-to-head race or racing for the most drift points. All racing types are enjoyable. and not hard to get the hang of. If you're into arcade racing games, give this a shot."
"I am usually not big on racing games, but this is actually a really fun game. I don't give a crap if it's not a 'simulator' - The graphics are great and the gameplay is down right fun."
Great racer with the g27!
Cannot recommend this game enough - brilliant progression with an unusual storyline for a racer. Very good.
"GRID 2 is to TOCA what Showdown was to DiRT. An overly-americanised, arcady dude-fest that caters to those with short attention spans. That is not to say GRID 2 isn't fun - it's good fun, until you complete career mode or unless you enjoy racing online; because beyond that, GRID 2 lacks depth.  GRID 2's impressive array of cars seems to lull you into a false sense of security, as it makes you imagine that the track content lives up to the same standards. But you'd be disappointed, as the small selection of tracks follows Codemasters more recent trends, and the even smaller selection of actual race circuits is plain rediculous. Put together with the fact that this game considers a 6 minute race to be an endurance event and you begin to see why this game isn't truly a simulation.  Car handling further follows the arcade trend of this game, as although fun, a great lack of realism again rears its head. GRID 2 rewards you for drifting; so much so that sliding around the corner in an Ariel Atom is apparently far superior to taking the corner like any normal racing driver would.  So ok, will this game produce some spectacular youtube videos? No way. Codemasters took their rediculous camera angles to a whole new level. Replays show very little of the actual race and more of your car's front wheels (why!?) along with other angles that show relatively nothing (I mean hello, why are we looking directly at a backdrop when there is a race going on?).  So my verdict? 6/10. Hugely disappointing arcade game that is indeed great fun but makes you feel cheated as you progress through every moment of gameplay. Recommended? Yes, to those who like this kind of thing; but if you're looking for a sim, you've come to the wrong place."
"Grid 2 is a great racing game overall. I believe codemasters games did a really great job on the graphics and car driving mechanics. however, i dont like that every time you go around a corner the seems to want to drift. i mean you have to be better than the stig to keep it from drifting. graphics are visually stunning and the damage mechanics are almost that of a soft body physics engine. i will note one problem is that the koenigsegg agera r likes to be a two wheeler in stead of a four wheeled car. the customization should be a little more like forzas and it lacks a first person view and open world exploration. i personally believe that they could have done better with this game. and at that i leave you all to your own opinion about it."
"This is an excellent driving game made on a modern platform. Unlike GRID 1, this game is less of a SIM and more of a relazed driving game. If you are looking for a really good SIM...this is not it."
"Positive stuff: technically the game is very good, the engine works nicely and is also light; it works really well on my pc (which is not that powerful). The online works without too much lag, and there are many tracks and cars to choose from; also, the single player career is long.  Negative stuff: DLC to unlock cars online.. yeah, not mandatory and you can spend your time, but it's not good. DLCs adding cars and tracks cannot be used in the normal online mode (only custom games). The game tries to be realistic, but then you notice that you gain more than two seconds per lap by DRIFTING, on every turn. The AI is not good, and is quite mandatory to gain at least 3rd place in the first turns if you want to be ABLE to win, no matter how good you're driving; if you don't it's impossibile to gain first place. There's no official cockpit view, and the career progression feels quite anonymous.  Conclusion: this game does NOT suck. It's funny, solid and can keep you busy for hours. The fact is that is GRID sequel, and in my opinion the first game was much better in almost every aspect; this doesn't feel like Grid 2, but more like an anonymous racing game.. well done, but anonymous. If you can get it on sale and like racing games go for it, but if you know (and loved) the first GRID then don't expect the same amount of awesomeness."
Not Motor City Online but overall a fun game. Should catch your attention for a few hours.
"My first racing game was Need For Speed Carbon that has always been my gold standard. Coming to this game I was dispointed. The racing physics engine is fine no issues there, but it also seems dull. Thee game runs like a set of random races, arcade style. I never felt immeresed like I had with for instance Carbon. I also found mself missing car customization sure, you can change the apperance of the car however, you cant do anything to change how it drives. If you want an arcade game go ahead and buy the game while heavily discounted otherwise save your cash for another time."
Definitely a Good game. The graphics are great and as long as you don't play 3rd person. (Bumper cam ftw) The game feels very fast. Works perfectly with my G27 which is huge. Lots of controller options so you are able to get exactly what you need.   Other than that the only downside is they pulled back on customizations over the first one. Even tho you can still purchase upgrades like engine etc. It still would have been nice to have some extra tuning capabilities.   All in all this game is exactly what I was looking for.
"Great racing game, arcade style with plenty of cars and nice challenges. Good graphics and nice race tracks."
Maybe its just me.. But I kind of liked Grid 1 beta for some reason
you must buy this game
"They shipped it too early, filled with bugs and very repetitive. Fun for 4 hours maybe but then it dies of"
"Good simulator game but in half this is also the arcade racing game, but after some time in this game I got bored a little bit."
"Ok, lets start with the physics, this is actually like the worst physics in a racing game that i have played and i mean it. Drifting is very nice and smooth but in normal races, the drift events feel really really weird and its annoying to drift there or maybe its just me. The graphics are just great ! This game is from 2013 and in my opinion you could still compare the graphics to a new game (if you are playing with everything on MAX!) Overall this game is really fun to play only if the physics and AI was much better it would be a fantastic game ! Right now i would rate this game 7,5/10 and i really recommend everyone to atleast try this game---- THX for taking your time and reading my review."
"For starters, I'm not really sure if I really like this game or if it's starting to get really annoying.  As someone who really liked the first GRID, GRID 2 starts off nicely. The somewhat familiar handling and feel to the cars is there, the atmosphere is nice and especially the tracks feel nice. The UI is straightforward and easy to use, but maybe a bit on the slow side when it comes to the garage and customizing liveries for your car.  So far, I'm having fun. I'm getting a good feel with the cars and handling, I get to know most of the tracks and all seems fun and games. But once you start progressing in the game, the infamous bots start to get annoying really fast. The back of the pack brakes really, really early into corners, cuts you off intentionally from overtaking and you literally have to sit there and watch as the top 3 bots get further and further away. You literally have to plow your way into the top 3, no bumbers spared, at which point the leading cars have gotten way too far away to catch up. So you restart. Over and over and over again until the AI screws up and you get a run where you get to the head of the pack early and have a decent chance.  That's when I started to realize that there really hasn't been any feel of being the better driver in this game. Sure, your cornering improves over time and you get to know the tracks but most of the time youre just fighting the same AI that literally feels scripted with the head of the pack always pulling really far ahead and the rest of the bots are there just to ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥.  There is, however, some difference to the types of race youre attending. Regular races and time trials give you the most pain with bots, elimination and face-offs feel decent enough and enduraces are ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty.   Still, on my first playthrough few years back after GRID 2 was released, I remember having tons of fun and maybe I'll get that feeling again once I finish the game a second time. I heard online-play is decent but with quirks of its own but I haven't tried it for myself.  TL,DR; Recommended but with reservations, decent arcade racing to enjoy on your own or with friends. Steam Controller recommended.     Race Restarters' GRID   "
cool game when it worked :C
"This is one of the best ARCADE racing games I have ever played in my life like NFS underground. The physics are better than NFS games. Online &amp; Career modes are really enough. If you want an ARCADE racing game, this is the best. If you are looking for a real racing simulation game just get F1 series such as F1 2013. Thanks to codemasters for building these games!  MAC OS X NOTE: If you buy GRID 2 Reloaded version you could face a problem during game such as 'damaged downloadable content'. The solution is easy. Close your steam application. Clean caches in your SAFARI via develop menu in SAFARI. After then, open steam and right click to GRID 2. Click properties and open local file tab. Click verify cache. Finally, restart your computer and it's done!  Have Fun!"
This is a massive waste of money the company who created this game have commited daylight robbery I personally this game has not been optimised for any control system and the physics in this game is seemingly non-existent due to the massive neglection of friction as the vehicle you drive initially has less grip than a weightless car driving on a polished metal surface with gripless wheels. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF: -You don't want to waste your money -You don't want to give a money grabbing company (who are possibly worse than EA) money -Have at least one functioning brain cell
" I loved it, graphics are awesome, gameplay is great with controller and car designs are great. Game modes are great and there's so many great cars that you can play with. Online is not really good because of the unbalanced matchmaking, I hate to play against 99 level players when I'm lower. :P "
"Here's a sequel to Race Driver Grid. With all glee the developers said, 'Be fast and be first, We'll give you a thirst.' That's not what the developers did!"
"GRID 2 is a fun racing game. That's all there is to it. If you're looking for *incredible* graphics/narration/customization in 2016/beyond, go elsewhere... But if you have an itch for a race or five, drop the $30 and keep coming back for more.  I wish it were a bit more realistic, but for a 2013 release it's solid.  3.5/5"
"Cheaters! Speed boost and extra grip - two most common. And the only way to get rid of them is to report steam profile. Codemasters don't give a f**k about this problem. As for Valve I dunno if they ever issued a VAC ban for this game. It's a real shame because the game runs smoothly and it's enjoyable. I have no DLC and frankly I don't care. These RaceNet challenges don't pay too much eighter and it's like a single player extension really. I would give it solid 8/10, but because of cheaters it gets 5/10."
"GRID 2 manages to inject a nice dose of realistic physics within an arcade style racing game. The result is a game that simulator purists will surely frown upon.... (lack of view, no tuning) but everyone else will enjoy. The locations and cars look absolutely stunning. The single player is meaty and the multiplayer is absolutely worth playing"
"The pros: - Great game for you if you like racing games with no open world. - It's easy to control. My 5yo learned fast and loved it. I bought for him. - It has a flashback feature which feels totally like cheating but well... it's in the game so... - Graphics are awesome.  The cons: - Price is high for what it delivers. - No car mods. - The base game gets you so few cars. They removed like 90% of the cars of the main game and put them on DLCs for sale. - Won't let you skip cutscenes. I hate games who do that. The impression is that the game thinks its cutscenes are SO AMAZING that you should see them. Not only cutscenes but you also can't skip little transitions in the game, which is annoying. - On windows 7, alt tab will mess up video resolution and sometimes not even get input anymore, only after restarting the game. - No real 'first person' view with handle bar and everything. Also no handbrake controls, you'll have to drift with your regular brakes. Also no mirrors, but you do see a little arrow when cars are close to you."
Gave myself the nickname 'Bird'. ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful.
"I dont know y people hate this game, so far i like it. only down fall for me is there is no one only to play with."
"Grid 2 is a mix between arcade and racing simulation, not as good as the first one but you will still have a good time with this sequel. Consider buying it on sale.  + Decent variety of events. + Over 25hs of singleplayer career.  + Acceptable variety of cars.  + Cars sound really good. + Optimized and gorgeous graphics.  - No cockpit camera. - Tedious loading screens between everything. - Unskippable and unnecessary videos. - Weak online mode."
"Great Game worth the money. Playing it with Logitech G27 wheel &amp; pedal set amazing handling, Can drift the car if you get the set up right. I brought the Reloaded Edition with thye extra DLC &amp; extra cars if you can afford the extra few quid the get this edtion :) HAVE FUN RACING"
its ok. i wouldnt spring out of bed to go play it
""
Nice game
verry nice game.is so realistic.i recomend it!
Really enjopying this one. Good graphics and game paly.  COuld do with a little more damage when you hit a wall/another player  But good fun all the same
This game does a bloody good job at combining arcade driving with a racing-sim feel. Which makes this game quite amusing to say the least. Too bad codemasters' support for this game is just terrible.  Definitely better than any NFS game!
"Brilliant arcade/sim racer, easy to master, long to complete. 8/10"
"Excellent physics, excellent graphics, excellent audio, and tonnes of cars, what more do you want?"
"I'm bittersweet about GRID 2 in particular. I love this game. It's good quality, though I'd still say GRID is much better than GRID 2. Where GRID 2 takes the cake is the lack of limitations for online races. Codemasters didn't take the simulation route like they had done with DiRT 3. There are no driver assists options at all, controls are simple and forgiving. POV cockpit mode was never included and I feel like the developers really messed up with that decision.   One thing that put a terrible taste in my mouth is the ridiculous amount of DLC available. And let me warn you; it's ALL or NOTHING with the DLC. If you own any DLC another player doesn't have, they will not be able to join your game. You'll have to host without using ANY DLC, that means the free car add-ons aren't available either. I have absolutely no appreciation for how Codemasters is trying to conduct business using this tactic, and it'll probably keep me from buying another one of their racing games in the future."
Grid 2 is simply the best racer for PC. Period
"Based off of what I've played on this game, it is absolutely amazing. Another well done by Codemasters. It's an absolutely beautiful game when it comes to graphics and gameplay. However a great game does come with a major con. This game requires you to use a controller or racing wheel no matter what. It's absolutely horrible with the keyboard because the handling model is different. Otherwise I would recommend this game to anyone who likes racing games. Really well made"
"Literally the most infuriating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game I have ever played in my life. I love racing games, have done lots of simulators, and while most racing games may have really unrealistic mechanics, this still manages to eat the ♥♥♥♥ of them all. Biggest waste of money I've ever made, and I wish I could have it back. I despise this game with a passion and recommend it to no one. Only good things are the graphics. How the environment affects the movement of your car is beyond unrealistic. If the side of my car barely touches a barrier on the inside of a turn at 100mph, should the car stop moving and not be able to move forward? How does that make any sense at all? The designers need to get their heads out of their asses and figure out what physics are, because with how inconsistent this game is, it sure as hell doesn't follow any. The handling is awful too. I have an easier time drifting and controlling vehicles in real life than in this game.   TLDR; Graphics are beautiful, crashes look pretty, handling and physics are some of the worst I've ever seen."
"Been wanting a decent racing game for a while, so I got this whilst it was on sale. This is by far one of the best games I've purchased in ages! I'm going to play this so much!"
Great Game! comparable to Gran Turismo on Play Station! A car fan must have
"A pretty solid single player racer with sweet eye candy and a lot of nice and varying tracks. As in every Codemaster racing game there may not be a huge amount of tracks and during the single player campaign it might get a bit repetetive but in a nutshell the game stands a solid ground.   For multiplayer, unfortunately, many of the tracks, especially the 'tube' ones are very narrow and the game is harsh with punishing small errors or collisions with other drivers, which will ruin the fun, when up to 12 competitors are rallying on the track.  If you want to have a nice single player racer, go grab it. If you seek multiplayer &gt;&gt;fun&lt;&lt; you better get another title."
"meh, not the GRID i remember...but it's fun"
Man if you haven't bought this game you haven't drove a real car! 13/15
One of the best racing games outside of consoles.
"All arcade racing fans out there that don't own Grid 2 and are contemplating whether or not to purchase it, at $10 this is truely a bargain. The DLC's are worth purchasing as well!  The graphics are brilliant, the cars and circuits are awesome and you get a great variety of tracks to race on, and there's also a free Demolition Derby DLC that will automatically be downloaded after purchasing the sim.  In regards to the vehicles, it has a decent amount of cars to start with, however I strongly recommend purchasing all of the DLC's which aren't that expensive considering how many cars you'll end up in the game!   Important note: When I first purchased this game it was running fantastic with all the settings on high with my Intel Quad Core 2.8 Ghz processor (Overclocked at 3.8Ghz), then suddenly one day I went to play it and it ran like a dogs breakfast! I spent a good month or so trying to figure out what the issue was, and I finally came across a very helpful person who gave me the immediate remedy to the problem! Sorry for pointing the finger at you guys at Steam, but someone had at Steam had changed the compatibility settings under properties for the Grid 2 application by adding a tick to run it in Windows 8 compatibility mode!   Once I removed the tick as recommended by this helpful gamer, the game was running brilliantly once again.  Their are even a few mods on other sites that improve the graphics and make the cars handle more like the cars in a racing sim than an arcade racer.  Note - Overclocking is entirely your choice, just make sure you understand the risks that are involved, and what is required to overclock your PC! This is not something I recommend, nor do any of the staff at STEAM!"
"The original GRID was not a favorite with fans of racing simulators, but in my view it trod the fine line between simulator and arcade very well. The successor has given up and gone with a limp, dull sequel.  The driving mechanics of the previous GRID were perhaps a little forgiving, but subtle variations in car choice and the wide range of event types lead to an almost inifinite level of replay value. There was the strong sense of team progression, and a sense of adversity was found in the way that other drivers were named and recognisable, but never so important as to be 'bosses'. Instead, teams took that role.  In short GRID was fun, casual gaming that alllowed you to tackle the same track 10 times and end up with ten completely different, intense outcomes without any feel of rubberbanding or jumping through hoops.  Now, on to GRID 2. Having played a few hours of the game I have yet to understand exactly what the difference between the first ten cars is. There is an overwhelming focus on 'drift' mechanics. The first five or six cars were all classed as 'drift' even though the circuits are all allegedy street. I was actually quite excited to get the opportunity to try a car with 'balanced' classifications, however on the first hard corner I locked up the wheels and was treated to exactly the same on-rails-feeling drift mechanic as the other cars had provided. In short, this is the first major flaw with GRID 2: the driving mechanic is facile. Apparantly drifting is the way they want you to drive, and their idea of drifting is applying the brake and steering in. Countersteer is frequently unecessary. The clunky driver aids interfere with any attempt at deliberate over/understeer outside of this narrow definition, making all the cars feel samey (at least in my short time with the game).  Beyond the fact that this is a racing game with poor driving mechanics, I feel that the rather pointless and restrictive story is another aspect that I rapidly came to dislike. Similarly the irritating focus on a social media-driven prestige system with kudos - I mean fans - as the currency, without any actual finance system or budget, meaning that you mindlessly plonk from race to race. Whilst driving the same car. However, these flaw would be liveable, if only the racing itself wasn't so crap. The 'top notch' AI is as pants as the driving, with very apparant rubberbanding, a heavy brake foot and none of the panache or daring-do of the drivers in the first of the series. Also, the damage system in GRID was regarded as forgiving. You've not seen forgiving until you've played this game.  Before the review descends into a complete disappointed rant, I feel I should focus on the positives. Some of the levels are devastatingly pretty. Dashing along the California coastline through wooded clifftop roads in the morning sun was absolutely brilliant. Also, the gameplay mechanics really bring this to the fore as you don't have to watch the road as you drive, allowing you to soak up the glorious vistas. That being said, however, the city levels are bordering on the sterile. There is some sense of place, but very few of the city centre layouts provide the same level of white-knuckle experience and, strangely, do not look as good as the venerable predecessor. Whether it's the layout of the tracks, the less immersive sound design, the feeling that your car is wrapped in cotton wool or the flabby handling, the city racetracks do not deliver. Furthermore, I feel I should add that there is a game mode which involves the track getting switched around as you drive laps, which would be great if it was some kind of add on once you got to know, and presumably love, each track. Howver, being thrown into this mechanic after a few goes, without being given any preview or name for each layout, is bewildering and dull. Put simply, it heightens the feeling of banality introduced by the handling: driving at pace on a racetrack whose layout you do not know should kill you, not be easy.  To conclude, do not buy this game unless you want something apocalyptically dull. I would even recommend buying the original GRID, flawed as it is, because it is a much better game. It even still looks good, and the experience of throwing yourself down a head-to-head midnight togué track has to be one of the most fun racing experiences I've ever had."
"GRID 2 combines both an arcade and simulation style racer creating a unique, intutative and responsive control system. The cars are fast, pretty and there is an element of cusomization eg. color, wheels and my favourite... wheel size :D Looks amazing, plays amazing and there is lots of content 9/10"
very arcadey but still a great game lots of cars tracks easy to get into mutiplayer no connection problems or lagg what so ever
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN GRAN TURISMO AND NEED FOR SPEED IS A GOOD GAME THAT IS FUN.
great game!
"Its $10 today! Buy it, buy it, but it is all i can say. Its awesome and everyone that likes to race should own a copy!"
"Best racing experience on Steam so far. Perfect graphics, loving the arcade game play, exciting for adrenaline."
"NEED HELP!  This is a good game however with my Logitech F710- Cordless Rumberpad 2, I've problems with steering. I tried setting to D-input then go to steamapps-grid 2 then under grid 2 input into the folder: i edited dininput default, Logitech F710 input, steering inputs etc./ still unable to figure it out.  The problem with steering just puts this game completely off and irrelavant and I am unable to control it as it is too difficult to steer due to its sensitivity and issues with as it keeps going off track. And into the game always end up as last RACER.  It rendered this game completely useless and worthless to play to steering issues please help: even looking into this forums-  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=35085100  it still unsolved as i am not a programming expert. I figured that quote 'Steering – Increasing the DEADZONE can make the car feel less twitchy. Decrease the SATURATION if you feel the steering is not sensitive enough. Increase LINEARITY if you are finding it too difficult to hold the car in a straight line. (Can use negative numbers if needed)'  Linearity can be edited but where do i find that in the game specific folder and after countless tweaking and tweaking still cannot solve the problem cannot go to advanced menu in game etc.../ i close the game always with unsucessful tweak.  Linearity is important for me, as i always cannot drive the car in straight line centered, please help me steam or any experts out there...  Thank-you-for-reading.  "
This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome; One of the best racers iv'e played.
"moost unstable racing game ive played, highly iritating -_-"
"The best racing game available for PC. It's no Forza, noit even Gran Turismo, but this is the premeire realistic (yet aracdey enough to be fun) racing game available. Highly recommended."
"I love this game. It's so much fun, and I love the full damage model. The game runs surprisingly well on really low specs, and looks absolutely amazing when set to its highest. Although the online leaves a lot to be desired, the single player and split screen are a ton of fun, especailly the customisation of your paint job. Some people may not like that there is limited if any customisation of your car's engines and stuff, but that means you can just get right into the racing. This has to be one of my favourite racing games so far... apart from Mario Kart DS, but that's not important right now... Buy it, it's amazing..."
Graphic = cool  
"Best car game available on PC since GRID 1. Some say GRID 1 is better and I won't disagree, but if you liked 1, you most likely want to check this out too."
"Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. disapointed with this one, the brake is useless as every corner can be mastered using a powerslide without even applying the brake. I'm no hardcore racing fan but sliding around every corner just gets boring after just a couple of races. its like it was made by a different developer to Grid 1. Just play the first one again."
"Poor sequel to GRiD bound by last generation technical limitations and focus on the casual market.   The handling of cars have been oversimplified to the point of game breaking; the game's determination to make you 'drift' around each and every corner, no matter how slight, means racing lines and skill go completely out of the window making each race feel very monotonous as very little is required of you to complete each track. The handling mechanics go beyond 'crap' to 'ludicrous' in certain cars and it's well worth searching on Youtube for a video of the Honda NSX on Grid 2 to see how ♥♥♥♥ poor the game gets in it's attempt at variation in car physics.   The easy, uninvolving handling is complimented on single player with A.I from the playstation 1 era. The other cars will stick rigidly to the same racing line every race and inexplicable slow down near the end of the race to allow you to catch up if you've decided to play the game with your feet and found yourself in second place instead of first. Multiplayer is a mess when collisions are turned on thanks to the aforementioned car handling is coupled with the usual mindset of people playing racing games online where they decide to drive at you instead of turning a corner. When collisions are off, it's slightly better but again, thanks to the car physics, tracks are easily completed and winning comes down to who dribbles the least.   The graphics are typical of a Codemasters game: very polished with excellent car models and lighting but very flat backgrounds and atmosphere which takes away from how impressive it could look. The developers admission of removing the cockpit view to allow them to improve the visuals explains the game has been developed with the 360 and PS3 in mind, meaning technical limitations a lot lower than a PC could offer and hindering the visual potential massively. The presentation of menus and loading screens is again typical of Codemaster: They're excellent and very polished but again, detrimental to the game. All the fancy effects and and wooshing about in menu screens means you'll be spending more time navigating for races rather than actually driving which is contradictory to what has obviously been intended to be a quick, pick up and play racer.   GRID 2 can be summarised by what a user on the game's forums said: '...made for the Facebook generation.', it's polished and glitzy but extremely oversimplified and has put so much focus onto ease of use for casual players looking for quick rewards that it's actually detrimental to what could have been a respectable IP if it hadn't strayed so far away from what made GRID 1 good."
"Very good game, as wall as all recent racing games from Codemasters (beggining since first DiRT). Amazing scenarios and cars, good arcade/simulation balance and nice race modes."
"Grid 1 is 10x the game this is, don't waste your money."
"It's a great game, i got a lot of hours of fun with it. But keep in mind that is an arcade game and not a simulator. The fun here is to control your car drifting like a maniac! "
"This is beyond doubt the best racing game on PC. Looks fantastic and the best driving experience ever. Not to easy but not crazy hard to learn, just perfect. You can play online with friends and even has a split screen mode."
"Damn, This is awesome fast arcade-sim car racing and multiplayer really nice! and great! Visual effects is cool, I recommend :)"
"So Far Really Nice, nice driving style and the races look like fun -- ill coment again later on in the game. Thanks Codemasters."
Great challenging racing game. BUT MP is DEAD....
"Was looking at getting a racing game for my new gaming laptop from MSI, was considering this as well as NFS:Rivals, decided to get the game as it was on a $19 offer ...   1st thoughts - I must say that the graphics on this game was really impressive ... controls were no doubt non-simulator but it was fun to drive about arcade style similar to NFS games I played before ....   I was really looking forward to the online competitive play but I found out that the community has ... DIED ... there are no games online that could be found ... unsure if it's my time zone which is the problem? (+8)  I will be enjoying the single player but an online community would definately spice up the gameplay ..."
"Arghhh! The mandatory career story line at the beginning is tedious. Is this an RPG or a racing/sim game? The game appears to be useful as an introductory type game, though. And, once you get past the opening career races in the crappy Mustang, the races are more fun. The DLC's improved the playability exponentially. Haven't tried multi-player yet... I purchased the game 66% off. At that price the game is worth getting, but wouldn't recommend at full price."
"Great racing game, interesting ideas, good progression and story. Game is hard, and has no cockpit view (personally I don't use that view so wasn't a factor for me), physics are great, its inbetween a sim and arcade, feels perfect to me when going from a bathtub like a charger to a import tuner the game changes and is done right IMO. Won't regret it especially with all the DLC's and if you can find it on sale its a must have."
Crap. The first one is SO much better.
Bought this game and didnt even work. robbed AGAIN by steam.
"0/10 no first person, why no trolling allowed online complete bs."
"hold on, let me drift into everything."
Crap handling of vehicles over sensitive for my liking.
Please dont waste your money on this useless not enjoyable game. Yes this game has a very good quality but the gameplay just rubbish. the developer forgot the crucial thing when developing this game which is customer happiness and satisfaction! I played this game for a few hours and I feel like i dont even want to play this game for my entire life after that. its quite ridiculous physics applied in this game. Please just dont buy something that will just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off later!
No cockpit view to my dismay. For those looking for a simulator - look elsewhere. Just another pointless racing game with magical physics to ignore...unlike the first game. Should have previewed it more.
worst racing game EU
Well designed racing game! Loads of fun even without a steering wheel. Best spent 6eur ever ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°)
"This is a really nice game if do not plan on using a logitech g27 with full manual. It just keeps randomly droping into neutral and it ruins the game competely. This is a NO from me, because i only play racing games using a wheel."
"Fun arcade racer. Solid, and satisfying car handle mechanics. I blew a tire by heavily drifting on it too much. Great graphics. Download the Demolition Derby Free DLC. My engine died I got hit so hard."
A good balance between arcade and simulator. Good graphics.
very fun racing game!!
"I don't know if this game gets any better, but the chapters I have played are absolutely PAINFUL. (Fanatec CSR + CSP)"
It's like a better unheard version of need for speed...
its a funny and good game for racers
In short..... Not as good as GRID 1 but still an awesome game. If you are looking for a proper racing simulator then this is not for you. The game is very arcade like but can be greatly improved by using the cockpit cam mod.
"There are a few suggested fixes for the dreaded blackscreen, but none of them work."
GRID 2 is one of the most scenic and fun car games I have ever played 
"....the design of that game is really annoying , it's not a worthy pc-game - pure console crap in my opinion."
-bought game -thought driving would be easy -crashed 2 seconds in -tried again -tried 10 more times -uninstalled  10/10
Trying to use my Logitech G29 racing wheel with this game. Turning it on in the settings breaks my menu. Keeps scrolling up and can't change it back. I'm done with this game already.
"*shrug*  I played it for a bit. I'm not usually one to take chances on racing games, but I picked it up as part of a bundle thought I'd give it a go. Played with a controller, maybe it would have been better with a wheelthing?  At any rate, the cars just don't feel fun to drive. The controls felt kind of loose, and generally sluggish, maybe it gets less bad as you unlock other cars?"
A good balance between arcade and simulator. Good graphics.
"Grid 2 is fun in its own way but its nothing like the first one. The first one was more driving sim with several racing styles, but 2 is more arcadey and all styles of racing are very similar. Instead of taking what they had with the first one and improving it, they just made a whole different game using resorces from the first one. The worst part is the handling on some of the super fast cars. The stearing is incredibly sketchy and the slightest turn at high speeds will send you spinning. After playing 2, I just went back to one."
"Despite the negative changes that Codemasters has made to the game, this is certainly worth a look if you're a fan of the original GRiD. GRiD 2 lacks the accuracy of physics the first GRiD had, and the AI's skill level leaves a bit to be desired for, however the amazingly impressive graphics, excellent sound and top racing pace style all still make for an excellent game. If you do not own the original GRiD and wish to try out the series, I strongly recommend purchasing the original GRiD before getting GRiD 2. It's the better of the two."
"Buggy buggy buggy. Do not purchase!!!  Scenario 1: I was playing the game, hit Alt+Tab, and go back and forth a couple of times. Result: No keyboard response.  Scenario 2: I was playing the game, hit Alt+Tab, once, then remained on desktop and talked on Skype. Result: After a while, my Skype was blocked and the letter L was typed infinitely.  Cheers!"
This game is FANTASTIC easily one of the best racing games I've ever played great campain and excellent multiplayer. Only bad thing is nobody plays this game anymore because it is semi-old. Better to play on a controller not on keyboard like most racing games. Come join me on the track. 9.5/10
Great
This game is awesome. It has a ♥♥♥♥ing split screen!! i never expected that. 10/10 SP+MP. 
Awesome Game! I highly recomend it for racing game fans!
Pretty fun thus far. A bit arcady but overall worth the price I got it on sale.
"very cool game, has excellent compatibility with the logitech g27. the only thing i wish it had was a practice mode, that would have been awesome"
One of the better racers around
The bets game ever i got a for a weedend and i played this game 24/7 it is frecking amzing
very fun racing game!!
"I don't know if this game gets any better, but the chapters I have played are absolutely PAINFUL. (Fanatec CSR + CSP)"
"I probably just suck at this game, but if you are thinking about getting into a racing game, this probably isn't a good place to start. I found myself sliding all over the place trying to do the drifting crap. I'll keep trying at it because I already spent the money. Practice makes perfect I guess. If you want a racing game where they developers were super anal about driving physics I guess this is your game."
I've played this game for twenty minutes and I hate it already.  The first thing I did after the intro was start a custom drift event. When the event started I initially looked around and was greeted by a couple Ariel Atoms and other none drift cars in the drift event. Are you serious.. What the ♥♥♥♥ is that about.. The physics for drifting and overall driving didn't improve my mood either.   This game isn't even worth the $12 I paid for it. Glad I didn't spend any more...
Bought it because I enjoyed the first one install it as well as all DLC go to play finish first race fine go to play second game closes try a few more times game closes before it even starts google fixes turns out has problems with certain keyboards switch keyboards lets me start second race than causes my PC to blue screen and fixes in sight complete ♥♥♥♥
It's a relaxing game to play. :D
SO GOOD NICE WORK MAN but one thing...drifting is a bit too hard...BUT ITS GOOD!!!
Super sensitive controls with a Logitech gamepad and no sensitivity settings in game. Tried the first race in the hills for about a half hour before deleting the game.
"Fun game, Great graphics. I will say the racing is quite arcady but good if you're a casual racer.  This game has a decent car selection and great tracks. Well worth my 15 BUCKS! :)"
When are you gonna give Martin Luther King his car back?
Very tight controls
"wicked game, graphics are great, and the selection of cars are decent. online could be a bit more developed and maybe a bit more popular, but then nothings perfect. career mode is awesome"
"Grid 2 is a fast paced and exciting racer, a great combination of Simulation and arcade style racing games. The graphics are beautiful and the audio is life like!  There are a lot of challenges the game has to offer such as no car driving assists, no racing line and a difficult AI. However the game does lack in two areas I find important, buying your own cars and then upgrading their performance is non existent in single player, you earn you cars by completing races and you are limited in which cars you are able to drive for each race.  As for multi player I have spent a lot of time on this and find it really enjoyable, the race types are a lot of fun and it is easy to join a lobby. Sadly until you hit level 30+ other players often dominate the lobby because you're not able to start upgrading cars until you reach certain levels which can take quite a lot of time, and unless you download the DLC packs to get other cars you will not be very competitive until higher levels but still it provides hours of entertainment. Demolition derby can be hilariously funny and in a full lobby it can prove to be really challenging but also really entertaining. However there is only one car to use, two tracks and it is quite buggy. Rating 4/5  +Beautiful Graphics +Great sound effects +Multi-player is Social and a lot of fun! +Career is entertaining and doesn't get boring  -There is always 1 or 2 cars in each tier that are much better than the rest -Until you hit level 30 in Multi-player you will not be competitive"
"Very fun game, very arcadey but fun and enjoyable. Only problem is that there is no cockpit view."
"It's hard to make a review for GRID 2 , long story short as for my taste and expectations I won't Recommend this.  But don't let my review think GRID 2 it's a bad game.  Why I won't recommend GRID 2 is , for Im more into Simulation Racing. Compared GRID 1 and GRID 2 , GRID 2 it's more of an Arcade style.  What I hate most about GRID 2 is the constant oversteer which is actually aim towards for people who likes to see their car drift throughout the entire game. Which also casues bad experience for me as if you tries to turn bit harder your car will automatically oversteers and into a drift which is so unrealstic. I know cars tend to oversteer but not this freaking sensitive and easily.   I would Recommend GRID 2 for those who are Casual Racers while those who are looking for a more realistic or simulation racing games best stay clear of GRID 2"
"Good looking game, but too much of an arcade racer for me. No car tweaking, too much focus on drifting. In some races you HAVE to choose from a preset set of say, 3 cars.. Sometimes all drift cars, and then you see your opponents in 'grip' cars. That combined with an enoying arcade catch-up system completely destryoed this game for me, It's not fun, only frustratating. Especially when opponents constantly bump you to hell - if they nudge you, your screwed, bad. If you bump into them? You are still the one getting rear-ended....."
"I bought this on special, and I'm well pleased with it. The gameplay is excellent, with excelent graphics, etc. I was also keen to try the MP, half expecting it to be rubbish, but I was pleasantly surprised - MP is very good! This is no simulator, but it is an entertaining racer. Recommended!"
"The game is solid, it's smooth and made with some love. you can tell it has the pedigre from codemasters.  but the game still has a crash bug killing the display driver for some systems. if they get rid of that one day this will be a perfect racer for pc. untill then it's agrivating.   "
Easy for achievements.
One of the best drivers I've played but the DLC packs seem a little greedy to me. Can't play unlocked cars in LAN games which means I won't be buying extra copies since guests would be stuck with low cars unless I paid for unlock DLC pack. Gameplay is spectacular after you spend about 50 hours unlocking vehicles.
"A pretty solid single player racer with sweet eye candy and a lot of nice and varying tracks. As in every Codemaster racing game there may not be a huge amount of tracks and during the single player campaign it might get a bit repetetive but in a nutshell the game stands a solid ground.   For multiplayer, unfortunately, many of the tracks, especially the 'tube' ones are very narrow and the game is harsh with punishing small errors or collisions with other drivers, which will ruin the fun, when up to 12 competitors are rallying on the track.  If you want to have a nice single player racer, go grab it. If you seek multiplayer &gt;&gt;fun&lt;&lt; you better get another title."
"meh, not the GRID i remember...but it's fun"
Man if you haven't bought this game you haven't drove a real car! 13/15
Grid 2 is simply the best racer for PC. Period
"Fun, realistic racing game. Not like NFS games."
Don't buy unless its under $5. barely even worth your time. Can't fins people online using matchmaking. controls are arcady but pretend to be more than they are. nothing special about the graphics either.
Can I get a refund? This isn't even fun. GRID original was ten times better. There isn't even a cockpit view?? What a waste of money.
best racing game
"This game in particular is very fun to play.  Crash your own car, pimp your own ride, drive and win new cars.  The Singleplayer part of this game is quite trilling to do, though I must say drifting still proofs to be difficult for me because I keep overstearing.  I have tried out the Multiplayer part, but I cannot keep up with some of the people who have begon the game since release. If you wish to challenge yourself and others, I would recommend playing Multiplayer after you got a GRIP on the game (Lame Pun.).  "
"Another solid racer from Codemasters.  The game is based around startting a new racing code that, this gives the objective some cohegency as you jetset across the globe and build an impressive garage.  A mixed range of car styles and classes, race events and locaions keep the game interesting. Classic American muscle right through to GT3 spec race cars. Standard races, time trial, overtake specials, drift challenges and head to head one on ones through Japanese mountain roads give good range of play.  A tweaked engine that ran the original GRID still has enough power to offer stunning results. The cars sound appropriately meaty too. Music isn't too present, but there's a a cool track that kicks in on the last lap of important races that goes a good way to increasing the drama of the game.  My only criticism would be that the earlier stages are more interesting than the latter, and that there isn't any dynamic weather and time of day options.  If you're a fan of the original GRID, codemaster racing games, or racing games in general I'd feel pretty safe in recommending this to you."
Fun acade styled racing game
"Another great racing game from Codemasters, worth the money all the way..."
"If you think BF4 was bad with all its bugs it's nothing compaired to this. It's so full of things that either just doesn't work or work so very very badly that it isn't even funny to joke about. If by some strange happenstance someone responsible for this game reads this, please change career.  If it was worth my time I'd try to get my money back."
awsome :D
Fun to drift and stuff. And yeah.
It's a very good game! 
"Pretty good game overall, fast smooth handling, quite acradey but makes for a more fun experience."
"GRID 2 is not a great racer back when it first release, the lack of race discipline variety, road car focus, average driving physic and weak track selection really kills the game. The driving physic in the game is more to the arcade side (more than GRID 1), the tail of the car is constantly out even the GT3 cars cant really take a corner steadily. The game modes included in GRID 2 are Live Route, Endurance, Time Attack, Race, Elimination, Touge, Face Off and Drift.   Career is focus on a new sort of racing series called 'World Series Racing' and you are the star driver in this racing series. In GRID 2, you dont need to buy cars like GRID 1, whenever you require a new car to particpate a race event, the game will let you pick 1 car out of 2. The car that you didnt picked can be unlocked later in the game by joining one of the events. There are sponsors event that have races such as overtake and endurance as well.   Even with all DLCs, the game still feels empty in comparison to GRID 1. The DLCs adds 2 new tracks which is Spa and Bathurst, the DLCs tracks are great but 2 great tracks cant really save the poor tracks selection from the base game. As for the DLC cars, the AIs wont use them. You will always be the only driver driving it and there are a few weird car classing for the DLC cars. For example the Ford Sierra is class with the modern Volvo S60 for some reason. The drift cars can be used in normal racing mode but those cars lack of top speed. Another example is the Tier 3 cars, the Ariel Atom and Caterham SP300R could easily outrun the typical supercars like Aston Martin Vanquish and Mclaren 12C.   The only good thing I found in GRID 2 is the splitscreen option, it is great when you have friends to race with.  I'll suggest getting GRID 1 instead of GRID 2, it may be old but it plays a lot better. GRID 2 will be suitable for you if you dont mind the drifty driving physics."
 Just Awesome!
Realism is so overrated.
where do i get the red bull ring DLC? and yea DRIFT IS KINDA FAKKKKKKE nothing like grid 1 but you do get used to it after a while overall good game i give it 7/10
"Missing cockpit view! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apart from that, this is a great fun arcade racer with a heavy focus on drifting... lots and lots of drifting... even in high grip cars :/"
Cool game not worth the price tho wait for a sale 
great graphics and awesome cars.
"Solid racer, but I prefer the more real world race world of the original grid.  I also prefer the cars, tracks and handling of the old game, not to forget the team approach with multiple cars.  Codemasters chose not use real world licenses and ended up with a fantasy race league, which is IMHO again a real step back.  A city race with dynamically changing routes is not believable, as it would be virtually impossible to change a layout while the race is ongoing as is the case in Grid 2. Not that it isn't fun, but again it detracts from the level of realism that was present in the original Grid.  In the end, regardless of some graphical improvements, I just prefer the original over Grid 2 and hope that Codemasters will revert to the same type of game if they ever produce Grid 3.   Good game, but I recommend you look at Grid before Grid 2, unless you want to play multiplayer. Codemasters pulled the plug on the old Grid MP, not very nice of them...certainly not a long term selling point.  "
Amazing racing game loved this on the xbox 360 and its even better on pc! People say that racing games arent ment for computers but to be honest they are just as good on pc as they are on console again this is a racing game that i would recommend i got it on sale for a fiver and ive only played 3.5 hours and im loving it!
"This game is a really good arcade racing game. The DLC packs are awesome, and so is the RaceNet integration with YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. I would actually recommend the Reloaded Edition, as they contain all the DLC packs except the Unlock Cars pack."
I love it hrs of fun its a great game only down side laggy
Grid 1 was better. Too many noobs turn a race into demo derby. Corner cutting sucks
"This game was a huge disappointment for a number a reasons, the biggest being the driving experience which focuses almost exclusively on drifting. The graphics are acceptable but for the price you'd expect much better. The use of a story line is obnoxious. The boring, senseless plot serves only to force you to complete challenges in order to unlock new vehicles and tracks. You get the sense the developers where locked in a room with nothing but a case of Red Bull and the entire Fast &amp; Furious DVD collection until they spat out this game. I actually like their Formula 1 games so it's hard to believe this one was so far off the mark."
"it's a pretty cool game, and will be even better if you have a steering wheel. :)"
"One of the best racing games i've played. Only minus is that GRID 2 visual part is not up-to-date, thats all."
♥♥♥♥ realistic racing games. The slightest tap of the brake causes me to spin out. Bumping into another racer causes you both to spin out. I haven't finished a single race online. This is pathetic.
"If you're looking for a racer with lots of choice, tweaking, and freedom, this is not the one for you. Grid 2 is a linear experience laden with fluff. It tries to be both an arcade style racer and sim, yet the result is a game lacking all the things that make either of those fun. There's no buying your first car, no upgrading or tweaking, no planning your own path or making meaningful choices. Heck, most of the time you're not even allowed to drive the cars you've 'unlocked'; it picks which cars are available to you - often as little as two, sometimes only one - each race.  My biggest gripe has to be the handling. In an effort to make it exciting and 'edge of your seat', they've essentially just taken away grip and forced you to drift. You don't even have to brake to initiate drifting with most cars - simply start turning and you'll slide all over (or off) the road. It literally feels like you're hydroplaning at all times with the majority of cars. Some 4WD cars handle reasonably, but you can't stick with one because the game forces you to pick from the cars it wants you to use per event.  The story is groan-worthy. Instead of earning money, you earn 'fans', which actually do nothing except open up the next race in the linear career mode. You're beaten over the head with hashtags, fake news, social media, youtube, and narration about how you're going viral. It's painfully bad, like watching your parents try to use some hip lingo they just discovered. It's all just meaningless fluff that makes you want to facepalm and wish they had spent the time on adding some depth or choice to the game.  Lastly, the AI for some reason are absolute homicidal maniacs that give exactly zero craps about you or the laws of physics. 90% of the challenge in any race is managing to find a way around them without getting pummeled to death. They'll occupy the entire width of the road, cruise in front of you and brake, ram you off the track, and bounce you around like a pinball. You can be on the inside going around a corner, and they'll actually turn into you from the outside line, knocking you clear off the road while they continue like a freight train. Inertia? Mass? Pfft. The AI cares not about such silly things.  As for positives, the graphics and damage are lovely, the game runs like a dream even on a GTX460, and I experienced no bugs whatsoever.  TL;DR:  Pros: Pretty and smooth  Cons: Wonky handling, all fluff with no choice, homicidal AI, boring and groan-worthy career mode, no in-car view  "
"Edit: It would appear that after some time, my game still crashes frequently. I am changing my review to express my discontent. I feel like the racing style is more enjoyable than GRID, but due to bugs I can't recommend it. Also, a lot of DLC. All expensive, and keeps being released instead of patches. I've been an avid GRID supporter for years, and I do enjoy other Codemasters racing games. I'd rather play GRID than GRID 2. It's not worth the money.  This game is fairly new, it's a great build off of the first GRID game however. Updated graphics, and displays. It takes racing to a whole new level, at least arcade style racing. It's super fun and worthwhile."
"This game is indeed fun, however it is almost equally frustrating. I am left with the feeling that is rigged after driving a near perfect race and still being seconds behind the computer's first place player. Most likely this is cause by most of the races being a single lap long, and the game chosing to start you WWWWAAAAY back in the starting grid. It does not matter how good you do it will always place you in the middle to back of the pack. This is not normally a problem in a race with 3-4 laps, but when the race is a single lap long you spend the entire race trying to pass your way to the front. As far as I can the computers with the same car as you will always beat you off the line by A LOT! This is just a cheap compensation for a poor AI."
"-Grid 2 is fun for singleplayer -lack of players on Grid 2 online for PC, only found one though... played this game on PS3 and mange to get in a plenty of seesions  thats about it, the devs need to do something about online..."
It's like someone took a good-looking racing game with a questionable-at-best physics engine and took a giant ♥♥♥♥ all over it. One of the biggest video game disappointments I've ever experienced.
great game i recommend anyone who likes arcade type racing games to get this :D
"Amazing Racing Game! 9,5/10. The only thing that i don't like about this game is the AI, feels like all the AI Cars are helping the #1 AI Car in the Race win the Race by blocking your way and basically creating a barrier for you. Other than that this Game is simply amazing and really satisfying to play!"
A good classic racing game. Kinda simple with lots of fun and lots of sweet wagons.
"This is decent racing game, but only if you've got rally wheel. It is pane to play it it with a keyboard. Graphics are pretty and challenges are interesting. Really enjoyable."
Hell yeah I do
"when i try to atart this game all i get is a bluescreen, anybody help??"
For Top Gear Fans. It has a good version every memorable car from the show.
Pump the juice out of the RB26 engine then you'll realise this game is worth more than how it is ;)
Solid racing game Nice car drive feel. Looks awesome
"Entertaning , and completely worth the money I spent on it. It's not perfect, and does have some annoying probelms with both single and multiplayer. I ampleased with graphic performance based on my system specs. I do wish there was a better selection of vehicles."
"Better visuals than the first, but the cars are way to drifty. An american muscle car e.g. 1970's Ford Mustang, slight twitch and i'm sideways round a corner, like seriously... and also ruined gamelay with likes. There's no money or co-driver, you don't feel like your progressing or getting better. There's no teams to follow and improve and you acquire cars for free, just for coming first or beating a particular time. I've played for maybe an hour or so and already have 33 cars."
Great graphics and very fun!!!
"This game sure has a lot of mixed reviews on here and it does suffer from some annoyances. Even at times it seems like a bit of a step back from grid1, but don’t let that stop you from checking it out. The game is fun, its arcade racing it’s what you would expect from it and I am having a great time with it.   I love simulators, racing with a wheel and everything, but it’s a different animal. It’s putting down laps, tuning, putting down laps, and tuning some more it can get to be a little bit of grind. There is no real carrot on a stick in the sim world to keep you going and wanting to unlock things its all about the driving(which is prefectly fine). However this game is just grabbing the controller, throwing the car all over the place, drive tons of different cars, go into corners way to fast and just have some fun.   I’ve always been a fan of codemaster racing games; I got into them back on the ps1 with the Collin McRae games, and then onto TOCA, all good times. Coming to this from the first Grid it does seems a little dumbed down I suppose. It was nice to have to save up money to buy cars instead of just getting them handed to you, and doing the Le Mans race between season ect. However the career board got a bit overwhelming with having so many events to do all at once.   That is one nice thing of how the career progress’s, and not overloading you with races. Instead you are going through each region one at a time. The race types are pretty much what you would expect, nothing to terribly annoying or un-fun. I am a big fan of drifting and the way the cars handle for the drift events is really horrible, they have too much grip and will just catch some grip and send you into the wall a lot. It’s weird to get used to because you basically have to drift wrong to get anywhere with it, so I was a little let down by this. A lot of people just complain that drifting is in the game, and its “drift to win” but while actually racing there is plenty of cars that you don’t have to drift, you can still do perfectly fine with them and are they are quite a bit of fun.   There’s no cockpit view… yeah you hear it as the biggest complaint. For me I got used to driving in bumper view way back from gran turismo finding it not only more of a sense of speed, but also better for nailing apex’s and having a good idea if you’re about to lose your back end, and save it before it’s too late. I do however prefer to use cockpit view having played a lot of sims using a wheel, but this is not a big deal for me personally I do fine driving in bumper view and have fun with it.  One thing that bugs the hell out of me is when you do a flashback it’s not replay mode like it used to be unless you completely total the car. It was interesting in the last games to watch you’re crashes in slow-mo and enjoy the amazing damage model before resetting it back. Also the AI are complete Asshats and smash the crap out of you all the time seemly for no reason other than for the hell of it. It wouldn’t be so bad if you could actually get back at them, but if you hit them they don’t move at all. It’s pretty damn lame and one thing I am yelling about all the time. If they don’t want to race clean that’s fine, but when you can’t take them out for being ♥♥♥♥♥ than its pretty frustrating.   Also in terms of the AI the difficulty seems to be all over the place. I started out at Medium and was having no challenge and bumped it up to hard. Then the WRC races start and for no good reason other than to make it a pain in the ♥♥♥ the AI in front gets a massive lead and its damn near impossible to chase them down even if they are in a much slower car, it doesn’t seem to matter. So the regular races are stupidly easy and the championship races are stupidly hard and you always start in the back. If you can’t get up to 3rd in the first turn you can’t win in a championship race, and good luck getting past the AI that can’t hold a race line to save their life and if you are holding your inside line get ready for a pit maneuver or someone quickly moving in front of you so you smash the hell out them.   Overall, the game is fun, it might not be as good as the first grid, but it scratches the itch with not many racing games on pc that lean toward arcade when you want to just have some fun. I see no point in going back to play grid 1 so this is perfect. I would like to see some more customizing, buying parts, a little bit of tuning, I know this isn’t the style for these games, but I refuse to pay M$ for an xbox1 and I really miss Forza. Also this DLC is getting out of hand and it has been for a long time. It’s pretty much the price of a second game if you would have bought them all as they came out. Buying them in the bundle is a good deal, but it feels like it’s all stuff that should just frickin be in the game anyways.  "
Hands down a great game.
"Great driving game, Loved it, Will finish it and wait for GRID 3 !!!"
decent game good graphics but am unable to save my game so it is useless dont waste your money or time with this game
"Why call it Grid 2 when it has nothing to do with the first one! This is pure arcade, the only thing missing is guns and shields for the cars, even Blur as better handling than this one. If you are not into arcade racing forget about it."
Well i played race driver grid and now Grid 2 and i must say it is a fun racing game to play even if you have friends that play it it just makes it much more fun to play with friends
Better than NFS!
One of my favourite racing games. I love it. You can choose many different cars which are divided in four classes.
"Awesome game, I'm really enjoying it, but I wish that there was a in cockpit view"
"i enjoyed this game very much just as an arcade racer, but now that the computer screen doesnt change when i go to world series racing, i cant play the game. If anyone knows how to fix this please message me, but overall a fun arcade racer that feels fast"
"First , i was sceptical about buying this game. I said , what can be better than NFS. Well , Grid2 is ! Awesome graphics , car controll is very good and the game was on SALE ! =))"
that's feeling of speed
"Great game that's easy to pick and play, loads of great cars to drive.  One downside though, it's very arcade-style. The cars all handle very similarly but by the same token this makes it an easy game to play casually."
"Well how should i put it...... I've read both the positive and negative reviews and I have to say that both these types of reviews hold true to the facts - its just a matter of inclination from the player's point of view of whether they want to bear the opportunity cost stated in the negatives and (want to) play this game. I personally like this game very much but it does have some issues with plain linear racing - by which I mean this game does have problems with its physics (a certain 'overcompensation'), no matter how minor. And yes like another reviewer stated here Grid 2 developers hve gone mad with drifting! They expect a drift for proper corner handling every time a bend comes up! And frankly I'm not a big fan of drifting either. Then there's the damage reporting - which frankly dosen't exist except for a single indicator in the speedometer, and which when compared to Grid 1 (which had 8 - 4 wheels, 1 engine, 1 transmission, 1 suspension and 1 handling) is certainly a big leap downwards. Some will be put off by the abscence of a cockpit view. Now people reading this review might be thinking why I've recommended this game with all this negativity - well, I'd now would like to tell you why this game pretty much makes its competitors look drab - the graphics is a monumental achievement (compared to Grid 1 - which was pretty darn excellent), the feel and gravity (literally!) is very realistic (albeit slightly problematic physics) - for example you can really differentiate which cars have better torque and which cars have higher rev ranges, and the (car) damage as realistic as ever. So although Grid 2 might struggle to live up to (and even falls short at some points) the name of its predecessor it sure does put one darn good fight with its rivals."
This Is The Best True Racing Game I Ever Played  The Drift................
Great Game!
"Astonishing graphics(my eyes were really surprised at the first race in this game :D) , really good car handling mechanics and really nice environment to race in , if you have not played Grid 2 and are undecided to buy it or not im telling you you should go all in on this , its a really well made racing game."
Grid 2 is a great race game and not just for die hard race fans! This game feels right looks great and the races are intense and awesome! if you could choose 1 race game this should be it!
"This game is pretty bada$$, if you do end up playing make sure you have a wheel. Controllers suck in any racing game i think except for shift 2 which i thought was really bad. Yes it's true its no simulator but its quite fun to play. Might have people complaining about the cars drifting, i would like for you to really think this one out. If you are speeding 140 and you are going to hit a semi-sharp to sharp bend, 'YOU ARE GOING TO DRIFT!'. Lol well thats my say-so and if you don't like it you can shove it!"
awsome game!!!
yes i would recommend this game because i was a big fan of grid 1
this game starts with an anticipation of greatness but quickly becomes dissapointing as the more you get into the game the worse the cars handle. there is no consistency of handling between the diffent cars and this makes the game enjoyment dissapear very quickly. I would not suggest this game.
Great Game!
"Without doubt the best pc racing game i have played yet, the gameplay is great and the visuals are stunning. Grid 2 has a very arcade feel to it rather than being a serious racer like i.e the f1 type games. I personally prefer the arcade type racers and with online multiplayer you can have endless hours of fun in very competitve races. Grid 2 is definately worth the money."
"This game is excellent! All though theres no Cockpit view, it's not a game ruiner. I love the fact that theres more custmaztion options now, and it makes the game better in my opinion. The handling physics are also pretty good, the idea of drifitng around the track in order to go the fastest possible, is actually surprsingly good, and gives the game a great arcade feel to it. I'm not disappointed and am looking forward for future GRID titles.   As a Reloaded edition owner, the DLC's are very worth while in my opinion, 50$ worth of items for just an extra 20$. That's a good deal. This game is one of the best PC games out there for the PC. My only wish is for Drag Races in the next GRID title.  To conclude my review, the game is probably the best Racing Game on Steam.   Keep up the good work, codemasters!  Rating: 9.1/10 "

 Just Awesome!
Bought this game and didnt even work. robbed AGAIN by steam.
"0/10 no first person, why no trolling allowed online complete bs."
"i bought this game and i do not regret it. its really good, and is on kinda a fine line between arcade-y and simulator-ish"
"All in all, pretty good.   I have to admit that the game has been a little glitchy, with my rig crashing an average of once every 45 minutes, but for some reason I keep coming back. Anti-aliasing settings seem to be part of the problem, and once I dialed them in a bit it seems to run a lot better now.  There is something about the ambience, the quiet music and the feel of nostalgia. Starting out in your own suburbian garage? A world racing league? It grows on you, fast. The story is not so in-depth that it gets in the way. (I mean you, NFS: Undercover!) Some may say over-simplistic; if you are into being able to control every little setting on your car than this is not for you, but if you like feeling like you are part of the story, than GRID 2 is..."

"Amazing game, So smooth, high quality"
So far I have barely played it buuuttt... seem super hard to get into for me (I am a fps gamer) and I feel the controls arent super reactive.. but I dont know much about racing games. 7/10
"GRID 2 is a great arcade racing game. The crashes are insane, the races are intense, and it looks excellent on PC. Moreover it presents many interesting car classes and events, the AI is one of the best out there and races are fast and adrenalinic."
good for some hours but not more hours
Pros:  -RACE FAST CARS -DRIFFFFFFFFFFFFFTS -IT LOOKS NICE Cons: -The announcers voice is annoying  9.8/10
"good graphics, fun driving!  7/10"
"I expected more, and so the first part I liked more than the second("
"This game is amazing. The mechanics are near flawless, though may require some getting used to. This game is not an exact simulator, but more of a mix between an arcade, drift racer and a racing sim. However, I find this game to have the perfect balanceof these two subtypes of racing in just the perfect way."
I wouldnt recommend this game at all. All the changes they did were horrible. One of the best part of GRID 1 was the Drifting for me but the new changes in GRID 2 are no where close to better
Its good 
"Exellent game, but if you are going to buy it make sure you also buy the DLC pack. "
"Best on Intel Haswell CPU.......Although it is not a simulator game, it still good for the new born racers."
"you have to log in to windows gaming service online to save games. if that isnt disruptive DRM, i don tknow what is...,.15 mins to find passwords etc."
sorry to be a party ruiner but this game sucks!
"What to say about this game. Besides the whole deal around the cockpit view, there's much much more this game doesnt get right. First of all it's a fun game which has good looking graphics that run fairly well on slower computers and has a great destruction model of the cars. This beeing said, the game itself is like a broken record (the same stuff all over again), simply said the single player is like any other racing game, you are trying to be the best racer in a racing league, with the distinction that now you are supposed to be the poster-boy for the racing series, but it doesnt make any difference at all. The multiplayer is where the game is supposed to shine, unfortunately, it isnt true. Even though technically the MP works fine, the people completely ruin the expirience, To explain: most people ram you and grind the bariers around the corners. Simply said, most poeple play it more like Burnout rather than a somewhat serous racing game.  So to sum up, it's not a simulator, it's not an simulator like racer (e.g. the first GRID of the NFS Shift series). It's an arcade racer, I don't recommed it for the full price, you may considder getting the game if it's heavily discounted (75% or more). If you are looking for a fun arcade racer, get it, if you are looking for a simillar expirience like the first GRID, get GRID or NFS SHIFT 1 or 2.  I'm still recommending the game as it's fun when all it's elements work, and I enjoyed it except for the occasional frustration in multiplayer."
You can't play with Logitech GT unplayable. It have nice graphic the sound is good.
Great game. Even better when 5.1 surround is turned on as the narrator bugs and you cannot hear him. Turns it into a really fun racing experience without the annoying voice over talking to you like you are an idiot.
"While this game is fun, it's not simulator. I bought this thinking I would get a racing game with real physics and racing simulation but this is full on arcade.  If that's what you want, then this game is perfect for your but don't be trumped by the reputation of this series. Go for Grid Autosport instead."
Unlike the first Grid game this has a very Arcade feel about it and does not have the same feeling that the first one had. The game feels like it was rushed with not much thought put in to the gameplay aspect.
"Fun, exciting and still enjoyable after a year. great visuals and fast racing with some beauttiful cars. Great tracks and awesome multiplayer. Cannot wait for its 2014 sequel: Grid Autosport. Grid 2 is great"
Realism is so overrated.
Really awesome game and I would recomend it to anyone
"Great game with alot of features, but the multi-player is hard to navigate around, as you cant really choose what game mode like the first grid, but great graphics and 'story' mode. Overall very good, needs a little bit of work in multiplayer."
This game blew me away with the visuals but lacked in audio. Id like to hear the roar of an engine not the sissy vwoom vwoom noise all the damn time
"this game is awsome,,,good graphic racing car"
"Hugely disappointed with this game, especially with all the hype! Single player you do not buy cars, you earn fans, big mistake, also now that the multiplayer is dead, you cannot progress there either, maybe Grid AutoSport they will put things right"
Half of the game is in DLC... It just doesn't hold a candle to GRID 1.
"Thank god I got this on sale it's a waste of money. I thought it was going to be a much better version of the first GRID, but boy was I wrong. Everything is completly different and its not even like the same game anymore."
Good racing game. Played the first one and enjoyed that game. This game is just like the first one with some better driving mechanics and a reworked single player racing 'campaign'.
I never liked racing games before GRID 2. Very fun and the flashback system is really well-thought-out. The only thing that annoyed me was that whenever I alt-tabbed the game would mess up my graphics settings. Perfect 10/10.

GRID 2 brought me a lot of fun. It rides that thin line between arcade and sim and it does so brilliantly.
"Was hoping for a good sucessor to GRID. However, GRID 2 disappointed me with drifty and arcadey handling of the cars. So if you like racing sims, this might not be as enjoyable as GRID, if you like arcade type of games Single Player in this game might be your thing. Don't buy it for the Multiplayer part as it riddles with cheaters and trainer bots."
"i never played grid 1, so i cannot compare it to that. This game is no simulator but i throughly enjoyed the game, get it on sale tho ;) Graphics are amazing, driving physics was slightly different from what i'm use too but i thought the game and gameplay was amazing :)"
"For an arcade fan: You'll have a blast with a huge amount of challenge.  Driving simboys/girls: If you don't take this too seriously, you can have a great time in between those more realistic games you play.  I took this game as pretty pure arcade, and I had great time playing. Graphics are nice, sounds are ok, 'plot' if there can be one mentioned is... ummm... not that interesting, but when you stick to driving, this is a nice game.  9/10"
"Fun game pretty good deal for $12.49 couldn't pass this Racing genre. Great Graphics, gameplay, cars, but I still miss GRID 1's original cockpit view as to the 2nd version lacking it :( Just a way of lazyness on the developers part. They took it out using a 1% users use cockpit view shouldn't matter it's a racing game all racing games should have this view no questions asked. Multiplayer is a blast especially bringing back Destruction Derby. Single player would be ok if they didn't make the opponents over powering like when you want to make them wreck they have way too much power over you from making it possible you either have to go 100mph to side swipe them to even get into any collision, other than that good luck trying at any other speed, please make this an option or fix, thank you. Other than that the game is worth the money especially the sale we had."
"It's a very enjoyable racing game, but has its ups and downs. I actually got into the original GRID very late, having picked it up on sale a few months before I bought GRID 2. The handling and the gameplay is very similar in both titles, even the drifting, in my opinion. Yes, there is a lack of in-the-seat first-person perspectives, which is a shame (even though there are no-car 1PV and over-the-hood 1PV); though to be honest I have always been a 3PV player when it comes to racing games so it was of no consequence to me.  The base price of the game is steep, though, as is the $30+ for the DLC. I picked up both during the Steam Christmas sales for a total of ~$25, which I think it a fantastic deal.  The campaign mode is a lot more linear and simplistic than the original GRID, though. You no longer have the ability to hire on an additional driver to your racing team, which is something I miss. Rather, you essentially just beat other racers to gain popularity for Callahan's World Series Racing ... thing. And then beat them again the the actual WSR. The AI in the single player is pretty simplistic as well, and follows very predictable driving lines (and will predictably crash into you without a care in the world), and usually brake far too early. Getting through the campaign on normal difficulty will make you better than a lot of the players you find in multiplayer though &gt;.&gt;  The multiplayer is a whole other deal. You buy cars with money you win in races, which is fine, but unfortunately there's also a leveling system applied. And it's VERY much a grind. I've been playing a lot since I got the game ~3 weeks ago, and I'm only at level 12 of 99. You can't even start unlocking Tier4 cars until you hit level 20-something, so prepare to play Tier1 and Tier2 a lot, unless you're happy with crappy loaner cars in T4 (or... buy DLC). It will take you something like 20 races just to get to level 2. Thankfully, there is also an enjoyable Global Challenges system that will give you a needed XP boost, but it only cycles weekly. DLC can give you an edge, but at the same time hosts of custom games can just turn DLC off, so ... yeah.  Speaking of DLC: Yes, I picked up the All-In DLC pack while it wa on 66% off, which was a good deal. Here is my general take on the packs: - The Spa Francorchamps pack is worth it for the track alone. Haven't had much time with the cars to make an opinion on 'em. - The Bathurst track pack is kind of meh. - Demo Derby is fun and free. - Peak Performance Pack looks like it's a bad deal, but is actually decent. In the MP, you can upgrade cars to make them perform better. If you upgrade them fully, they get ranked a Tier higher than usual. The Peak Performance cars are all Tier1 cars upgraded into Tier2, BUT these DLC 'performance' cars actually perform a bit better than their counterparts if they get fully upgraded. Thus, a fully upgraded Volkswagen Golf R in Tier2 will be slightly worse than a 'Golf R (Performance)'. Additionally, some of these cars are ones you'd want to have in both tiers anyway. - The Classic Grid pack gives you two very enjoyable Tier4 cars from the original GRID, but I'm not convinced that they're necessarily better. The DLC Koenigsegg CCGT is significantly slower than the Koenigsegg Agera R (which is the fastest GRID2 car in the game). Not bad cars, though. - The IndyCar is pretty nice, but you're not going to find a lot of ppl using it much. - No opinions on the rest."
"The Good  - Exceptional Physics  - New style of racing events  - Stable and Stunning Graphics  The Bad  - Awful audio quality  - Annoying lens-flare  - Horrible video upload system  - Repetitive and Boring gameplay  - Lack of any customization  Final Score: 5/10  Codemasters missed the mark, again, with GRID 2."
"Good SinglePlayer, Awesome Multiplayer with friends, decent in-game voip! Almost all you can ask for!"
"It's an okay game. The graphics are very nice, some new races. But it's too arcadie. I was hoping for some realistic racing. So if you're a kid who doesn't know how to drive. Play this game. Sadly I got bored of it a lot faster. the first game was fantastic, I was disappointed to see they got rid of the interior view."
"I recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a nice action packed, semi-realistic race game. I've got GRID 2 for my PS3 and PC, and it's much better on PC. Not only because of the graphics, but there is no lag while playing single player and i haven't experienced it online."
"This is Grid - but better. A touch on the arcade side rather than simulation by default, the damage, control and assist settings let you balance this just the way you want, rather than forcing a style you don't like. It's a bit drifty to begin, but then I love that! An excellent game."
cool game
"I thought this game was a pretty solid racer with alot of car choices, and i thought that they did a pretty good job on how the vehicles handled and sounded."
"This game has to probably be one of my favorite games, it's super addicting, and amazing, and I love it! Also it is one of the few racing games where I'm actually paying attention to the story."
"This game is excellent.  Pretty cars, lovely environments and a pretty good driving experience.  I too have experienced the 'aggressive AI' but in my opinion its less that they're aggressive and more that they stick to their racing line regardless of what you do and thus end up causing you to spin out and go off track often.  Still, super fun game."
"GRID 2 is not a great racer back when it first release, the lack of race discipline variety, road car focus, average driving physic and weak track selection really kills the game. The driving physic in the game is more to the arcade side (more than GRID 1), the tail of the car is constantly out even the GT3 cars cant really take a corner steadily. The game modes included in GRID 2 are Live Route, Endurance, Time Attack, Race, Elimination, Touge, Face Off and Drift.   Career is focus on a new sort of racing series called 'World Series Racing' and you are the star driver in this racing series. In GRID 2, you dont need to buy cars like GRID 1, whenever you require a new car to particpate a race event, the game will let you pick 1 car out of 2. The car that you didnt picked can be unlocked later in the game by joining one of the events. There are sponsors event that have races such as overtake and endurance as well.   Even with all DLCs, the game still feels empty in comparison to GRID 1. The DLCs adds 2 new tracks which is Spa and Bathurst, the DLCs tracks are great but 2 great tracks cant really save the poor tracks selection from the base game. As for the DLC cars, the AIs wont use them. You will always be the only driver driving it and there are a few weird car classing for the DLC cars. For example the Ford Sierra is class with the modern Volvo S60 for some reason. The drift cars can be used in normal racing mode but those cars lack of top speed. Another example is the Tier 3 cars, the Ariel Atom and Caterham SP300R could easily outrun the typical supercars like Aston Martin Vanquish and Mclaren 12C.   The only good thing I found in GRID 2 is the splitscreen option, it is great when you have friends to race with.  I'll suggest getting GRID 1 instead of GRID 2, it may be old but it plays a lot better. GRID 2 will be suitable for you if you dont mind the drifty driving physics."
One of the best looking racing games out there
"This game has really shaken my faith in Codemasters, I got this because I thought I would be playing an improved version of GRID, One of my all time favorite racing games.   'GRID 2 will also set the new standard for multiplayer racing with innovative modes, an entirely separate progression system and deep integration with RaceNet' - Codemasters  That statement is bold and false. There is no multiplayer in this game, and even if you do manage to get in the game theres so many latency issues. Yeah you can change your download region and try to find players but that usually just increases the problems if you do manage to get in a race.  I'm sorry but this game is a farcry from how good GRID was. Its a shame too because it had potential, but there already releasing another GRID game soon, while this game remains broken."
Awesome game.... Worth buying it.
Great race game!
love it. best racing game out on pc right now. until project cars that is. we shall see though.
It's fun arcade racing game. Cars are very slidey and you need to drift most of the corners if you want to play optimally. Some people don't like it but I find it very satisfying to pull off series of turns while drifting perfectly.  Singleplayer is racing on different tracks with few special events dropped here and there. It's nothing special.  Multiplayer is where this game shines. You have experience level and you get money from races. You buy new cars with in-game money. If you're just starting out you're in bit of a disadvantange because you can't use all cars. Once you're about level 30 you'll have access to all the cars you will ever need. Multiplayer works fine and there aren't any lag issues. It's fun with many people but can get crazy if you have collisions enabled. Most of the matches don't have rammers and even if you get rammed in the beginning you can usually recover if you're a good driver. There are still many players during evenings. If you can't find any matches you need to change you steam download region to London. I think it's the best multiplayer arcade racing game on PC at the moment.  That being said I can't wait for GRID Autosport. I expect this game to die once it's released.
"Racing realistic is it not, but fun nevertheless. It's on a 3D monitor {3D Vision] a good show, depth is there and taking corners and braking is very easy to do. The game has enough gameplay, hours of fun. There are moments if you play on the hardest settings that you need to do your best but it is doable."
"This game is loads of fun to play with friends if your not to serieus about it, its more like a street style racer than that it is a simulator"
"This is a aweful excuse for a racing game. It fails to be either an arcade game like burnout paridise or a simulator like forza. The gameplay is the same every race, you just drift through every turn at unrealistic speeds. The only good thing about this game is its graphics."
"Dont buy this. I got this for free during the Intel giveaway, and i can tell you that its not worth your money. Grid1 is far superior, and if you want a skill based game, go for trackmania."
"This game has some truly amazing graphics, my only concern is that when playing with a controller rather than th original WASD keys th car it a bit over responsive but you get used to it after 1 lap and youre fine again. Great game, going to provide me with hours of entertainment. A must buy!"
This game is the STuFF
"I've enjoyed this game alot. I needed something to play until Driveclub is released. The feel of the game is good. Its the perfect balance of arcade physics. Its the kind of game thats difficult to stop playing. I use the Dual Shock 4 controller with this game and it feels great. I dont typically play alot of racing games. But there are times that I feel like playing them and this one is a great one. If you want a great looking racer with a great feel to the cars then you will like this. If your looking for hyper realism, thats not what this game is going for. Its got basic car stats, but I do find that each car has a unique feel to the controls."
"A great game! If you enjoy racing games, this game is perfect!"
"Little step behind compared to the Grid, especially in multiplayer game its not best as he culd be. But is still a very good racing game with beautiful graphics."
not best racing game ever but it brings me lots of fun
"For a PC racing game, this game sure does the job. There are some things i personally didn't like, for wxample the cars are really drifty and pretty slippert too, and there is not a big selection of tracks to choose from, and it takes YEARS to find a game online. Though for an arcade racing game as it is, it's really good. Great graphics, too. So if you don't have an Xbox with Forza, i'll recommend this game to you."
"Very fun game, gets boring fast tho yes and no"
"A-Maz-ING!!! The best game ever! Well, not ever. Could do with a cockpit view but, meh! It's great otherwise!"
"Flipped a car twice, knocked another car into the ocean and still won.  8/10 Would recommend"
"Driving with 60km\h over a stone, flying over the enemy car and win. 10/10 Would fly again."
its asam thank you 
"you should buy this games on holidays sales , under 10$"
Its probably worst racing game i have ever played.
This was a good game for me playing it for 4 hours during free weekend :)
"The game is excellent, the graphics are amazing and sound is brilliant, driving a BMW through a tunnel sounds truly magnificent and the scenery is really beautiful, whilst you're racing down a cross country road you can't help but be left speechless, it is a truly gorgeous game"
Awsome racing game for all who are looking for some casual racing action with lot´s of nice cars.
This game is total BULLCRAP! the controls are screwed over! The overly drifty driving engine! Dont get me started!!!!!!!!!! The damage is awful! in my opinon. The 1st grid is a hell of a lot better!
"Love the game, hopefully a 3rd one comes out.."
Fun game great graphics. Don't expect to play online though. Servers are still up but nobody is ever on.
good game. i like play this racing game. we can customize our car and choose three different sponsor. running very well on my laptop. love this racing. better than grid series before.
the crashes are prrety bad-♥♥♥. needs ps3 controller support - or steeam does
Grid 2 is a huge improvement from the original game.
"A big disappointment.  I enjoyed GRID a lot, so naturally thought its sequel would bring me joy too. Unfortunately and after giving it much of a chance, I really don't enjoy GRID 2. The fact everything is about 'drifting', even the non-drifting events. The handling is pretty off compared to realistic racers, and is pretty stupid compared to other arcade racers so I'm not sure where it's supposed to fit in.   Obviously all the dull 'city' tracks are not realistic, and some of the modes such as 'Endurance' which basically changes the layout of the track as you drive around (to try and prevent you learning it, but the AI know exactly what to expect) are unrealistic, as well as the whole WSR concept.  The only real positive I had from the game was that the multiplayer was entertaining in the beginning, and compared to other CM games such as DiRT and the F1 series, as least you weren't forced as much to watch useless scenes/forced into a race before you'd even set up your controls/graphics etc..  I'd try GRID Autosport as apparently that is the resolution to this poor game, but the series has left me with a bitter taste."
"I had fun with it for a while, until I got past the first three seasons of WSR and got the faster cars, then everything became way too twitchy and I kept launching myself off of cliffs and wrecking all the time. The earlier stuff was fun though and if you like arcade-type racing and are better at driving than me, you might enjoy it."
"A good game, but somehow not as good as Grid 1. It's hard to say why - apart from more of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drift levels, why is it I can powerslide around corners in every race with perfect car control, but in the drift levels the car just spins or massively understeers when I try to do the same thing?  I thought it would be nice to drive a lot of different cars in this game, but there's no cockpit view, and since you have to use the hood cam to get a sense of speed and immediacy, you just end up staring at slightly different paintjobs."
So at first I would have scremed to buy this. But after the way CM is doing the DLC and pay to win. Its getting harder. This really feels like a game more focused on making money then anything for the player. Still no proper voice support or even in game chat. MP is just a ♥♥♥♥♥how in the first turns. CM give a free car to everyone and then sells it in a DLC. Save your money.
Wow Great. i fun a lot.
Great game
"If you want an intense, drifting, arcadesque racing game this game takes the cake and eats it too. From Fast and Furious inner-city street races, to the Initial D Mountain Passes and even traditional track races. The variety of cars is great and they are all fun to drive. This may not be simulation but its a hellava lot more exciting to break realistic racing limitations. Easily one of my top favorite games.  9/10 needed eurobeat soundtrack"
"This is my take on this game. Some things are really good about it, but I have some things that I also really don't like. For instance, I love the handling feel of the cars. The environments are pretty good. I dig the story and WSR thing. Things I don't like about it: Nothing but visual customizations. No qualifying (always in 12 at the rear). No cockpit view. The hood view is best, but if the pain is glossy, it's overly done in a way that massive reflections that make cornering totally confusing. Stupid 'light-up' arcade style arrows telling me where to turn. Overall, it's fun, but we really need less arcade and more simulation. I want a Forza or GT for PC. 6/10 stars."
"Grid 2 is just more goodness of Grid 1. If you enjoy the semi-arcade/semi-simulation style of the Grid series then you will likely enjoy this game. After getting used to the controls of the game in general, then getting accustomed to a certain car, you will find yourself flying through corners and overtaking your opponents without as much as a scratch on your vehicle.  While I don't enjoy the general interface of the game (I thoroughly enjoyed the trophie room interface of the first game) it is still usable and while I find it less user friendly, it does play into the realism of the overall game.  With multiplayer, Grid 2 comes with a split screen feature, which I find is extremely hard to come by these days, especially on PC versions of games. Online is something I haven't spent much time with, you are required to set up an account to access these features, and at the time that I tried, I was having issues with Steam Big Picture mode, issues that were preventing me from making an account. I will likely revisit this review to add comments on multiplayer.  As a huge fan of the original Grid, I can easily recommend Grid 2 as fun, fast paced, 'arcadmulation' racer."
I really liked the first one but this is good too.
This game is great if your looking for a Street Racing style or Drifty game. Recommend playing with a controler though.
great game
Can I get a refund? This isn't even fun. GRID original was ten times better. There isn't even a cockpit view?? What a waste of money.
best racing game
"Could have been a lot better, still enjoyable none the less."
No... Just DON'T BUY IT.. Buy Race driver : GRID
"Grid 2 is the first racing game in a long time that I thoroughly enjoyed. To me, the driving mechanics (drifting, etc.) are quite fun, and once mastered are very rewarding (I have not played Grid 1, so I'm not sure why people complain that the mechanics in this one are trash). Being a perfectionist in racing games, I played on the hardest setting and aimed to get first for every race, this gave me a proper challenge and something that sometimes took many many attempts to achieve and the feeling that I got after achieving the challenge was amazing. The graphics also deserve a mention, they are fantastic."
Racing is fun! YAY!
Best racing game evar!!!!
"Amazing racer game, its best if nyou have a gamepad as a keyboard is harder to use. A good graphics card is need to play on high graphics"
"Really great Racing game, but no cockpid view. How lame. Still this game is Worthed to buy and play.  72/100- I expect more"
"This is a piece of crap! Luckely I payed less than 2 beers for it and my god, those 2 beers would have been a saviour from my current feelings. How is it possible to develope a game without no feeling what so ever of actually driving a car without ending it before first trial!? God damn"
Amazing graphics and engine sounds!
"The graphics are nice, but other than that I don't consider it an improved game over the first, I'm a little sad cause I really liked the first one. I haven't played it for to long, but first impresions aren't very good, handling seems to force me to drift on corners :(. I was really expecting a mix of arcade and sim racing, but this is basicaly trying to be Need for Speed. Maybe it gets better but for now I'm not recommending it to fans of the first."
"I've nearly played this game twice through, and I'm still loving it. I wish there were a few more actual racing tracks than street circuits but the game, particularly in the latter stages, is hard enough to keep your interest. There is plenty of DLC available but a bit expensive for my tastes, I did buy the Spa DLC when there was a special offer on and may buy more if that offer comes up again. I'm running this game on low graphic detail but at 1080p on a fairly old PC and it runs fine.  For me the game gets a 9 out of 10....but then I do love racing games."
Don't buy unless its under $5. barely even worth your time. Can't fins people online using matchmaking. controls are arcady but pretend to be more than they are. nothing special about the graphics either.
"'Recommend'? Yes. But by the smallest possible margin. (On bad days, 'No'!)  If Administration were better, this game would be a slam-dunk piece of awesomeness. But, it's not. Call it 2.5 out of 5 stars (average of 0 for administration, and 5 for driving.)  TWO parts of Grid 2: -- administer the game, and -- play the simulator.  In Grid 2, I count using the steering wheel, brakes, etc. to drive a course as Playing, and everything else (getting online, creating races, finding a race, quitting, etc.) as Administration.  Playing is phenomenal (5/5 stars)! It just about balances out the rest of the product, because _everything_ else is a miserable, tedious, annoying, and frustrating experience, one which, had I known before purchase, would have caused me to look elsewhere -- anywhere else (0 stars).   Here are a few examples:  1. A race could take anywhere from a few seconds to hours (depending  upon settings and the point at which you arrived). A typical race of  a lap or two might take a minute or two to play. But, it takes  almost that long to start the next race. Literally, you are waiting  as much, or more, than you are playing.   Solution - I set longer races, 4 or 5 laps or more - though that  has it's problems, too. How long should a new arrival have to wait?   There should be no waiting for players to do stuff - such as while  looking at/changing cars. If I am joining the race, I should have  made those decisions first. If I am changing to a new car for the  next race, allow me to make a request (e.g., poke the F12 key  during the LOAD process), and THEN delay to give me time (e.g., 20  seconds so I can choose a new car). 20 second countdowns between  races is ridiculous!   2. Sound stutters, especially between races when LOADING the next.   Put audio communication on a separate thread!   3. User interface - certain things should be changeable on the fly.   I prefer to leave talking on (not Push-To_Talk). But, when the kids  start carrying on, or the TV, etc., I want to change this - worse  yet - when it happens at my buddy's house, I want HIM to change it.  But we don't because it means leaving the simulator, making the  change, then waiting until the next race begins. And that's  tedious!   4. When a new race starts, show race characteristics:    Damage is on, Collision is on, etc.   I _want_ people to know race settings. Especially since I leave the  race open so anyone can join. And I want people to know that, if  they play crash derby, their car won't last any longer than the  ones they hit.   5. Be consistent about behavior. For example, there should be an Exit  or Back option on EVERY non-race screen.   Much of the behavior looks like each Developer just 'did their own  thing' when they designed and wrote the component.   For example, if at the Online race board screen, how to Quit /  Back? Not mentioned (and it's an error in a lot of places, don't  just add it here, add it wherever it isn't!)   6. Quitting the game can be a nightmare! I should be able to hit the  ESC key, anyplace in the game - even while racing, and see  appropriate Options, one of which should always be Quit. Sometimes,  I have to leave _now_. I don't want to argue with the computer  about whether I can shutdown now, I don't want to wait while it is  dislaying 'Longest Online Drift'. I want out, now!   There was even a scenario in which I had to finish creating the  race, then race it, just so I could Quit. Bad. Very Bad.   7. When I create a game, I should be able to start playing it, even if  there is no one else to race [yet].   Right now, you have a huge problem - people can only Online-Race if  there are two or more people ready to race - me and my buddy. No  buddy? Then no race.   I'm not going to create a [custom] race because I'm not going to  sit there for an indefinite amount of time waiting for someone else  to show up. I can't race without them, and I won't wait for them.   Not a great Online situation.   I should be able to either race myself, or race the AIs, until  others arrive.   8. When I am waiting, e.g., as a new arrival to a Race group, for the  current race to finish so I can join the next, I should be able to  Spectate. I want to do _something_ enjoyable while waiting, perhaps  several minutes, for the current race to finish. Right now, I have  to twiddle my thumbs, because the race in progress could take 1  second or several minutes (10+) to finish (no indicator).   If I walk away, I might miss the start of the next race, but, if I  have to wait, I might get so bored I write critiques of Grid 2.   An alternative to 'something to do' is to allow me, as a new  arrival, to take over an AI vehicle, e.g., the last one.  I'd create a new option for game configuration:  New arrivals must wait for a new race, or  New arrivals may take over the last place AI car.   People should not have to wait!   9. In the category of not waiting, At the end of a race, the program  displayes the finish-board, alternating with lap times. Useful.   Then it makes me wait while 'LOADING ...' twiddles. No, bad!   One thread should be displaying the leader board, the other thread  should be loading the next race. (for the same old reason, Don't.  Make. Me. Wait.) Display the Leader board at least twice, but  otherwise as many times as necessary to allow the LOADING to  finish.   10. Settings were at the 'intermediate level'. I suspect a newcomer  to the gaming world would have some minor grief. (In this case, I  might not call it 'bad', just a 'lot of room for improvment').   It was not always clear what or how to set things. If you have some  experience with this sort of thing, you'll figure it out quickly,  if not, choosing settings may be a bit awkward.   For example: Under Options &gt; Controls, Arrow to the option you want  to change, hit Enter to put in change mode, poke desired button,  switch, or key to set. When all set, hit ESC to return to the  previous panel.   Anyone should be able to install the game, select a Help button,  and get the gist of how to do things, whether trivial like setting  action keys, or much more complex - like what the various options  in Create Race &gt; Tier are.   You support the Logitech G25 - great! But, I can't seem to use what  are called 'Buttons 1-4', button 4 is considered the default PTT  button, and it does not work (you'll probably want to set that to  button 8 so it's easily accessible while racing - if you like  Push-To-Talk). Why - is there something I must do? (they work in  other apps).   In summary, this is a great racing game, from a racing / driving perspective. And I highly recommend it based on that, but that alone.  EVERYTHING except the driving is an annoying, frustrating hodge podge, apparently designed and built by the lowest bidder; and if I had known I would have all the problems we had before hand, I would definitely have looked elsewhere for a racing simulator.  However, note that the problems I described above are the types of problems that can be 'easily' fixed via a patch release. You don't need to change the racing process, scope new tracks, design new cars, reconsider the physics of the simulation. That's all done, and incredibly well. It's all the glue that binds the parts together that needs a [major] overhaul.  Version 2.1, anyone? "
Great games for raceing and a lot of fun
"A race simulation? Not exactly, but codemasters has delivered the same high-octane race game that grid was known for, only better with a better looking UI and better thinking AI.  This is a very good sequel."
"So lemme get this straight, you guys are releasing all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC that should've been in the game in the first place as a reloaded edition because well, you people killed Grid 2. But you're not even decent enough to offer the people who unfortunately bought Grid 2 the reloaded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for having to put up with your ♥♥♥♥ game?"
"Bad ♥♥♥ game, great mechanics and camera views in a genre full of crappy games. LOOKING AT YOU CRITERION GAMES..."
every time i run this game my computer crashes i play other games with no problem i even reinstalled my whole operating system and still no luck kinda disappointed i tired it on my alienware laptop it worked fine there
"The way you have to control the vehicles just infuriates me. Im sure once you do it gets better, but the learning curve is just rediculous in this game"
"Well, this game starts great. You get to play some races with a wide variety of cars and everthing's pretty nice. But after some time you proceed in the WSR league and from season to season it gets harder. Now you are starting to notice that the tracks stay more and more the same and you only drive longer variants or more laps. Especially in one-on-one races where you have to drive the same courses 3 times in a row against different opponents.  In the last season the r3t4rd3d aspects of the game get the deepest impact. Since there are no qualifyings your starting position is always in the mid-field or the back of the track. This results in ever-repeating overtaking orgies where you have to catch a bulk of slow cars just to get to the few fast drivers that pack a challange. One thing that especially p1ssed me off was that though you start in the back of the pack in most races this is not valid for drift events. In drift events you might want to take it a bit slower to get a better angle at the right positions. But you can screw that because almost everyone else seems to start after you and seems to have no interest in real drifting. Instead they are just passing the course quickly. If one of those m0r0nic AI driver touches you while you block the road drifting sideways in a wide angle all your points of that drift are forfeit since a collision is detected. Well done Codemasters.  If I had to rate this game using american school marks, I'd give the early game a B+ and the late game a D, resulting in a mediocre C for the entire game."
i got this when it first came out and i realy liked it however Qosmio v2 didn't like the ammount of wok it had to do to run it aka 460m nivida n 8 gb ram to put it simply if your computer has heat trobles this game is way wores however i loved it got to japan eventsn it overheated n corrupted the save i rage qiut untill a few days ago andwith Qosmio v3 with a 770m gtx nivida card and 32 gb o ram it has no trouble running this game lol border lands 2 make it run hotter then this game out of club events on to getting my bugati varon ss YAY   in short good game tons o cars and a very fun game to play   just make sure comuter can handle it first don't want my screw up it killed Qoxmio v2
"OK, This is a great game. What i like about it, it that it has an acheivable ending. The gameplay is interesting, the challenges are great (except didn't get into the drift driving), the cars are great, the graphics are excellent! Would instantly buy a GRID 3 if it is developed."
"Very good racing game, arcade physics with a track setting, a bit like nfs shift"
"This game in particular is very fun to play.  Crash your own car, pimp your own ride, drive and win new cars.  The Singleplayer part of this game is quite trilling to do, though I must say drifting still proofs to be difficult for me because I keep overstearing.  I have tried out the Multiplayer part, but I cannot keep up with some of the people who have begon the game since release. If you wish to challenge yourself and others, I would recommend playing Multiplayer after you got a GRIP on the game (Lame Pun.).  "
"Another solid racer from Codemasters.  The game is based around startting a new racing code that, this gives the objective some cohegency as you jetset across the globe and build an impressive garage.  A mixed range of car styles and classes, race events and locaions keep the game interesting. Classic American muscle right through to GT3 spec race cars. Standard races, time trial, overtake specials, drift challenges and head to head one on ones through Japanese mountain roads give good range of play.  A tweaked engine that ran the original GRID still has enough power to offer stunning results. The cars sound appropriately meaty too. Music isn't too present, but there's a a cool track that kicks in on the last lap of important races that goes a good way to increasing the drama of the game.  My only criticism would be that the earlier stages are more interesting than the latter, and that there isn't any dynamic weather and time of day options.  If you're a fan of the original GRID, codemaster racing games, or racing games in general I'd feel pretty safe in recommending this to you."
Just Prefect Racing Simulator in present time!
"Cool racing game on beautiful race tracks. The graphics are just awesome, better than you would expect it from a racing game. The cars are highly custom paintable."
"just not a look in on the first grid,could have been so much better but sadly failed to deliver"
"Even if it's not as good as the first GRID, it's still a very good arcade racing game. Worth to buy at steam sales."
This games is too sensitive. Gave up after 3 races due to crashing. Please allow sensitiviity alteration. Other games such as need for speed series are much easier to control cars
"Very good driving simulator, takes skill to perform well in this game"
I downloaded this on a whim becasue I want a sim with good graphics. So far it exceeds my expectations. I would recomend this to anyone that has played Forza.
"The graphics are nice, but other than that I don't consider it an improved game over the first, I'm a little sad cause I really liked the first one. I haven't played it for to long, but first impresions aren't very good, handling seems to force me to drift on corners :(. I was really expecting a mix of arcade and sim racing, but this is basicaly trying to be Need for Speed. Maybe it gets better but for now I'm not recommending it to fans of the first."
"Without doubt the best pc racing game i have played yet, the gameplay is great and the visuals are stunning. Grid 2 has a very arcade feel to it rather than being a serious racer like i.e the f1 type games. I personally prefer the arcade type racers and with online multiplayer you can have endless hours of fun in very competitve races. Grid 2 is definately worth the money."
"Good graphics,cool and many carsnice tracks.A nice arcade racing game,I totally reccomend it!"
"Highly reccomend the game, just not any of the DLC. DLC not worth the cost."
"Amazing!!!! Best racing game out there!!  Get it and you won't regret it, even when your ♥♥♥♥ this game is fun xD "
"Now tha's how sequels are made. Excellent racer, as expected from Codies. In other words - a must have for every petrol head out there!"
"Solid racing title. Feels a bit arcade-ish at times, but nothing that ruins the game. With out a doubt a good 'AAA' title for racing."
"First let me start with the basics, the graphics look amazing. Secondly the driving is very fun but note that the handling is not as realistic as previous CM titles, it pulls more towards arcade than simulation and I personally enjoy it much more this way as you have more freedom with your cars. You stll have realistic chassis and engine damage that can make crashes fantastic to watch in replays but still best avoided at all costs when you're racing!!  Overall the driving is more arcade fun than simuation-like realism."
"It might not be a sim racer, but it's still a lot of fun, especially once you get to Europe and have some grippier cars to choose from. The tracks are great too, except for Yas Marina which has some problems with detecting you as cutting corners for no reason."
Bought it thinking it was another awesome game from CodeMasters... wanted to play online and couldnt wait for my TrackIR to come tommorrow. turns out. there are rarelly a game to play online and there is no vanilla cockpit view (wich i thought it would have. since its a MUST for racing games today). i feel like i wasted my money.
Real bad physisc game .....   DONT BUY ITS USELESS....  Codemasters isnt able to build a racing game.  This is true ♥♥♥♥ again from Codemasters. A waste of money.
Arcadish junk. Graphics are top notch but that is all it has going for it.
"First Grid is way better, don't waste your money"
"This is a terrible game. The graphics were deciving beacuse the car is grainy, scenery is well done, but steering is almost impossible, if you hold the turn out for too long you do a dougnut but can never recover. If anyone from Steam or even th makers and developers of GRID 2 see's this please refund me my 12.49 because this game s absolutely terrible!  I should have got Need For Speed Rivals instead!"
Focus ST. That is all.
"Allright, let's get one thing out of the way, for those who are looking for a realistic racing sim: you're not going to find it here. Not only is this nothing like the first GRID Race Driver, this is nothing more than a quick cash-in on the GRID franschise. Racing is arcadey as hell, AI is lackluster and customisation in singleplayer is limited to your livery.  In short, get the first GRID or wait for Asetto Corsa if you want the true racing sim feel."
"Theres hardly any racing games on PC nowadays so I decided to pick this up. I guess its fine as an arcade racer, but its nothing more to it than that. I was hoping it would be more like a racing sim like Gran Turismo, but its not. The handling of the cars can get really annoying and its like the game wants you to drift all of the time. This can get annoying on tracks where the corners are not as sharp and require slight movements. The visuals of the game are good. The most annoying part of the game is its focus on 'modern' trends. For example it frequently wants to remind you about camera-phones and social media. I died a little inside when it gave me an acheivment labeled, 'SWAGtastic'. Stuff like this left a sour taste in my mouth. I also think the whole point of the single player campaign to be about gathering 'fans' is kinda shallow. Is my character some sort of fame hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?  All in all, its a good racer if you just want to have a fun arcade style experience. While it wasn't the game I hoped it would be, fun can still be had. If I gave this game a score I'd give it a 7/10."
"The sequel to my favorite racing game ever, i was slightly dissapointed. It was a good game, and enjoyable, but after the decade it took after the first i expected more. The lack of demo derbies is upsetting, but it is still a very fun game."
"Gorgeous graphics, and good racing physics. Been looking for a good racing game for a while. I found it."
"Very nice game, only rammers are stupid."
"A superb racing car game , nothing less than the first grid"
This game is exactly what every single person who likes racing games should be forced to buy. It is simple enough that you can pick it up easily but challenging to perfect. The races get a bit repetitive by the end of the game but it doesnt matter as you will almost certainly play them in a different vehicle every time. An all round brilliant game and a must buy for anyone remotely interested
GRID 2 is amazing racing game! Way better than NFS'series...
This Game is a lot of fun.
Its alot of fun
A good solid racing game. Not too expensive either.
Must have game
"An immersive arcady racing game which adds a lot of features from grid 1 and it has a lot of replay value which is something hard for me to find in racing games, defo a recommend game"
"wouldnt recomend, if you loved the first grid then you will be really disapointed in this one. First no cockpit view, the game almost has no challenge to it since they give you everything, I have came in first every time and if you pick a car you get the one you didnt pick buy doing another race thats avilable almost right after picking your car.  no more racing for money in story mode no its for fans. The loading scene Is horrible looks like your drunk and looking at an on coming car about to hit you. They have really taken the focus away from racing and the challenge grid 1 had, now it more feels like its about being trendy and about the scene style then about racing. this game has just gone down. they should just infect it with that x-games crap they destroyed dirt with and get it over with.  their DLC is crap too, they release DLC car packs when they release the game and its of all the top teir cars...all they do is try and bleed you for money, its one thing to add cars down the line its another to basicly say hey you want better car? pay for them after you already paid $30-$40 for this game. DLC has gotten to the point where they sell you an unfinished game and charge you for the rest. Atleat alot of indie devs do it right and just give you more content."
"I loved the first GRID which melded arcade and simulation racing perfectly. So I was a little put off by reviews saying GRID2 was a completely different game. I needn't have worried. While it’s true GRID2 is more arcade-like than the first it’s none the worse for it. It looks good, it feels fast and the point to point races are excellent. I’ve recently got into the online mode and that too is a lot of fun and a decent game in itself (level up, earn money and upgrade cars). My only criticism is that it doesn’t feel like there are quite enough tracks. I would have liked more variation (many tracks are just different routes round the same city). But it’s a solid game and definitely the best arcade racer I’ve played since the original GRID."
"3 *** As a racer I like it, really its a good game. I can't help but feel like they could have done more with it. Eh well still its good and I like it."
"dis ♥♥♥♥, grid 1 was much better. this is boring. And the FOX news crap, is just bullsh#!. Makes me feel like a peice of sh!#"
Not what i was expecting.  FFB = 8/10 Sounds= 7/10 Physics = 5/10 Color saturation =6/10 Track graphics = 10/10 Car graphics = 6/10 (no cockpit + a lot of blur) Menu = 6/10  CPU+GPU optimization = 8/10 Wheel suport = 6/10 Content = 6/10 Reflections/shadows = 10/10
"If you like racing games this one is a must. A little more 'arcady' than the first, but I love it."
"...Sigh. So much potential, only to be mediocre, bland, and uninspired. I'm buttmad about the removal of the helmet cam, and the vehicle physics are extremely odd. Not to mention the AI seems like it was taken straight out of Twisted Metal or Rogue Trip, as their primary objective seems to be to murder you, instead of finishing first.  It's decent, and only decent. It tries too hard to be two things and it fails at both; it is neither a redline arcade racer, or an intense sim experience. Everything feels watered down and stripped, including the car roster. It would be a little more forgivable if they gave you more cars in every class to play with, but as it stands the roster is very ho-hum and forgettable.  It's a little sad, because the mobile game Real Racing 3 feels more like a true sequel to GRID than GRID 2 does."
Nice and faaast!!!!! 
cool graphics and amazing sites and more realistic feel.
"not as good as grid 1, but oh well still a decent racer"
"Entertaning , and completely worth the money I spent on it. It's not perfect, and does have some annoying probelms with both single and multiplayer. I ampleased with graphic performance based on my system specs. I do wish there was a better selection of vehicles."
Great graphics and very fun!!!
"This game sure has a lot of mixed reviews on here and it does suffer from some annoyances. Even at times it seems like a bit of a step back from grid1, but don’t let that stop you from checking it out. The game is fun, its arcade racing it’s what you would expect from it and I am having a great time with it.   I love simulators, racing with a wheel and everything, but it’s a different animal. It’s putting down laps, tuning, putting down laps, and tuning some more it can get to be a little bit of grind. There is no real carrot on a stick in the sim world to keep you going and wanting to unlock things its all about the driving(which is prefectly fine). However this game is just grabbing the controller, throwing the car all over the place, drive tons of different cars, go into corners way to fast and just have some fun.   I’ve always been a fan of codemaster racing games; I got into them back on the ps1 with the Collin McRae games, and then onto TOCA, all good times. Coming to this from the first Grid it does seems a little dumbed down I suppose. It was nice to have to save up money to buy cars instead of just getting them handed to you, and doing the Le Mans race between season ect. However the career board got a bit overwhelming with having so many events to do all at once.   That is one nice thing of how the career progress’s, and not overloading you with races. Instead you are going through each region one at a time. The race types are pretty much what you would expect, nothing to terribly annoying or un-fun. I am a big fan of drifting and the way the cars handle for the drift events is really horrible, they have too much grip and will just catch some grip and send you into the wall a lot. It’s weird to get used to because you basically have to drift wrong to get anywhere with it, so I was a little let down by this. A lot of people just complain that drifting is in the game, and its “drift to win” but while actually racing there is plenty of cars that you don’t have to drift, you can still do perfectly fine with them and are they are quite a bit of fun.   There’s no cockpit view… yeah you hear it as the biggest complaint. For me I got used to driving in bumper view way back from gran turismo finding it not only more of a sense of speed, but also better for nailing apex’s and having a good idea if you’re about to lose your back end, and save it before it’s too late. I do however prefer to use cockpit view having played a lot of sims using a wheel, but this is not a big deal for me personally I do fine driving in bumper view and have fun with it.  One thing that bugs the hell out of me is when you do a flashback it’s not replay mode like it used to be unless you completely total the car. It was interesting in the last games to watch you’re crashes in slow-mo and enjoy the amazing damage model before resetting it back. Also the AI are complete Asshats and smash the crap out of you all the time seemly for no reason other than for the hell of it. It wouldn’t be so bad if you could actually get back at them, but if you hit them they don’t move at all. It’s pretty damn lame and one thing I am yelling about all the time. If they don’t want to race clean that’s fine, but when you can’t take them out for being ♥♥♥♥♥ than its pretty frustrating.   Also in terms of the AI the difficulty seems to be all over the place. I started out at Medium and was having no challenge and bumped it up to hard. Then the WRC races start and for no good reason other than to make it a pain in the ♥♥♥ the AI in front gets a massive lead and its damn near impossible to chase them down even if they are in a much slower car, it doesn’t seem to matter. So the regular races are stupidly easy and the championship races are stupidly hard and you always start in the back. If you can’t get up to 3rd in the first turn you can’t win in a championship race, and good luck getting past the AI that can’t hold a race line to save their life and if you are holding your inside line get ready for a pit maneuver or someone quickly moving in front of you so you smash the hell out them.   Overall, the game is fun, it might not be as good as the first grid, but it scratches the itch with not many racing games on pc that lean toward arcade when you want to just have some fun. I see no point in going back to play grid 1 so this is perfect. I would like to see some more customizing, buying parts, a little bit of tuning, I know this isn’t the style for these games, but I refuse to pay M$ for an xbox1 and I really miss Forza. Also this DLC is getting out of hand and it has been for a long time. It’s pretty much the price of a second game if you would have bought them all as they came out. Buying them in the bundle is a good deal, but it feels like it’s all stuff that should just frickin be in the game anyways.  "
Hands down a great game.
I love it hrs of fun its a great game only down side laggy
Grid 1 was better. Too many noobs turn a race into demo derby. Corner cutting sucks
"This game is a really good arcade racing game. The DLC packs are awesome, and so is the RaceNet integration with YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. I would actually recommend the Reloaded Edition, as they contain all the DLC packs except the Unlock Cars pack."
"Great driving game, Loved it, Will finish it and wait for GRID 3 !!!"
decent game good graphics but am unable to save my game so it is useless dont waste your money or time with this game
sucha sexy lookin game dud its a 10/10 ruber chiks from me
"Fun game so far. My only complaint is in the AI. The computer drivers seem to be basically immune to ANY car damage whatsoever, and also do not appear to follow the same crash physics as players. I cant tell you how many times I've pushed the rear end of a computer during a slide, only to have them perfectly counter-steer and be unaffected. Yet, I am like a feather in the wind; during any turn or drift, just about any contact will set you into a tail slide, forcing you to mash backspace over and over and over :("
Good game. AI stupid at times.
"I got this game for 10 dollars and it is very fun. On medium difficulty i struggle to get 1st but usually finish in top 3. in easy i always win.  the graphics are very nice.  the cars are very nice.  yep. oh there is also damage on your car so if you keep crashing into stuff on the right side, then eventually you will blow your right tires and then you start pulling to the right and then you crash more, that kind of stuff really makes it more realistic"
"Worth the price. An accomplished racer for PC gamers, offers better and more realistic racing experience than other racing games out there for the PC. Most of the DLCs are purchase worthy as well :)"
"A good game,, with potential tobe even better !!! Graphics are mind blowing ,physics of the cars are great, game play is taxing .... In General I#m loving it !!!"
best game ever. i hated racing games but when i tried this i couldnt get off of the computer :D 
"It's back and it's amazing! Driving is a little more arcadey than previous games, but it's still awesome! The online is phenomenal, hope more people buy this amazing game!"
"such a great game, might wanna use a controller though :/"
Awesome racing game of my life man!!!
Very good and fun racing game
"I fired the game up and was met with an advertisement saying it recommends I play it with an Intel HD GPU so you can already guess just how excited I was to sink my teeth in to this.  As far as the game goes, it's a very beautiful arcade racer (as opposed to simulation. Whether this is good or bad depends on your personal tastes). The models, the lighting, the sound effects are all on point and they start you off with a half decent vehicle and have you work your way up in to much nicer stuff. There's a fairly basic yet still interesting story that makes you feel like you yourself are working your way up the ranks rather than simply 'YOU BEAT LEVEL ONE. NOW BEAT LEVEL TWO.'  Another thing I should mention is the game has a 'replay' function mid race. If you wipe out, you can simply hit a button and rewind the race about 8 seconds or so and try that part again. Is this very helpful to new players? Yes. Is this a great thing to have on a practice course where you're just trying to work on your cornering and fish-tailing? Very yes. Is this a good thing to have in the actual races? No. Look at it any way you want, it's hand holding and cheating. It's no different from gutter guards at the bowling alley and by having this function, it reenforces that you don't need to actually be good because your mistakes don't matter. It isn't simply 'You screwed up, oh well. I'll let you retry but don't do it again.' You have 3+ rewinds per race. You could argue that your mistakes actually don't matter because it's single player, who cares what you do? Let me come back at this with saying that Single Player should be readying you for competitive play, be it online or when a buddy comes over, or whatever. Maybe I'm just set in my old ways of racing where if you screw up, you start over from the beginning and you keep starting over until you get it right. Your opponents will be waiting for you to slip up so they can over take you and you keep running that track until you have it perfect so that you don't give them that opportunity.  However, everything I mentioned above is rendered null by one thing: stability. I cannot play this game for more than 12 minutes. I have timed it, it's 12 minutes and 14 seconds exactly, every time my screen goes black. I have since found out it has something to do with compatability issues with DirectX 11 but this is a 2013 game, DX 11 had been out for four years before this game's release. Why are we still having these issues? More over, why was this game designed for Intel GPU's? I have since found a workaround but I'm still beyond salty about how I've lost races not because I took a turn to sharp, not because someone else over took me, not because of anything I as a player have done, but simply a black screen."
pretty good... not my cup of tea though.
Very fun game when u drag couple of friends with u into it
"This. This is a good racing game.  It's not really realistic, but it is great fun!"
"I managed to slide on my roof 5 seconds into my first race on even ground. Basically I´m awful at racing games but i managed to laugh my ♥♥♥ off for 2 hours in multiplayer nevertheless.  Solid racing game, hilariously funny if you suck at it, I´d buy it for 2 euros again."
"Overall it's an OK racing game. You   can't   find cool soundtrack and great physics here. Visuals are impressive through (the only thing I like the most about this game). Multiplayer can be fun, but not for a long time. In other words, GRID 2 is trying to be a very enjoyable arcade racing, but fails miserably due to lack of content in almost every aspect of a game (not to mention awful Codemaster's DLC policy). Do I recommend this game? The answer is yes, but only if it's 75% off with all downloadable content included. Better check out DiRT 3 Complete Edition or even DiRT Showdown. If you really want a good racing sim, Shift 2 is the way to go"
"I'll have to say over all this was a really good game. It perfectly blends the lines between a sim and arcade racer. Just enough realism to not seem rediculous, but not enough sim to make things tedious.  Alternate game modes are fun, and keep things from becoming monotonous. It is a bit dated at this point, but still worth adding to your collection."
"GRID 2 was an amazing idea from the very beginning but efter playing it for a while I cannot recommend it to anyone who has been playing racing games before.   GRID 2 is the product when you mix Need For Speed with Forza Motorsport. It's unbearable.  As a Racing guy, I found the physics extremely similar to Need For Speed, yet the mentality is to be like Forza. I don't know how the developers managed to put both games into one.   Now to the game itself, the handling is FINE, it's not yet NFS, but it's nowhere close to realism. The car you start with sucks. It wants you to drift, in every corner. I've tried to do one single clean lap, but every time I brake, or turn, or whatever, the tires lock up and I cannot make a smooth turn. (I'm using a XBOX controller) .There is flying trash and smoke eveywhere on the track, it doesn't even look like a racing game. Graphics are fine, too, but what kills me is the stupid AI who somehow always catch up to after you reach first place, the UI, the unrealistic physics and lastly the cars.   The cars are the worst. There are only four tiers, muscle, drift, drift and...well, drift/balanced/grip. I tried to buy a car that was in tier three, but suddenly I need to buy the DLC. The DLC is also a huge turn-down for this game. Either you play for 20 hours and buy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car, or you buy overpriced DLC that is literally 80% of all the cars in the game. Shameful.  Pros:  Graphics    Cons: Driving physics Need For Speed inspired Price on Steam Overpriced DLC AI that sucks BAD support for controllers Very few cars to begin with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu  Targeted for young people Yet another fanboy game (like NFS and Drive Club)    I would NOT recommend this to any normal person. This is targeted for younger people who have never played a racing game before.   I think I'll go back to Forza 4 and my other racing games, because this, is not a good game at all. I bought it for 5 dollars on ♥♥♥ and it's not worth even that.  "
Your car slipping? FLASHBACK ! Your car hit the wall? FLASHBACK ! Car upside down? FLASHBACK ! Enemies overtaking you? FLASHBACK !   Great Game 10/10
10/10
Good sim for my wheels.
"Great game, amazing graphics, and i love the controls! All-in-all great!"
Very good graphics great gamepay
Sometimes this game is annoying but it's too awesome game thats why i can't hate it x3 10/10♥
Frigging awesome car game 9/10
"Pro:  Nice graphics sounds are good good for some drifiting   Cons: repetative game play  cant do any performance mods to the cars can only use certain cars during races  test driving cars is stupid you cant use any car on any track you want it has to be a car of a certain class to the track every race has the same sounds of music and fans screaming the same way no first person view on the car from the dash, lazy game developers   allo in all i would of never bought this game if i did some reasearch about it"
"It's arcadey as heck, so don't expect a real sim racer, but the game has a lot to offer with its various modes and tracks (can't get enough of the California coastal highways). Online play is solid and entertaining if you can find a decent custom lobby with damage on and flashbacks off or reduced."
"It's very similar to the Grid 1 but functionality and graphic is better, so realistic. even you can record your match and share it on youtube."
"The graphics are cool, the simulation too. It's a must have in racing games!"
I wish I could find more online servers... not sure I would invest on a game just for host parties or play with friends that have it.
"This game is great for everyone, and even if you don't like drifting, you will love this drifting game, it is endless fun and even funner with a friend."
"One of the best racing games i've ever played, fun, realistic but yet has a good arcade feel to it"
It's a great arcade game.
"Great phisics, it's been a while since I've played a racing game where you can totally wreck your car! The cars are a little bit too slipery for my taste regardless of the type of race you are in :("
"God general game, can be trained to drive ability, play a game that abuse through all the racing game The computer is god. Fundamental untouchable, a touch you will fly. 5 seconds of the distance between life and death war, linear hit me I discarded loses directly, I wanted to think so, I took advantage of it slips a head against him, and then I discarded 1 v1 model computer just like tanks, it hit you you fly, you hit it you fly, the leading time in fear lest being crashed, then the car got out of hand, hit the wall calculated, directly under the valley will be ready to cry I played all the racing game a car hit you from behind will make you accelerate, only this game computer crashed your car you are out of control On the difficulty of the game have feeling very much, very easy mode the first four seasons that call a thrilling, I couldn't play at the back of the difficulty, I since the childhood to play racing games, less than 20 hours go through NFS14, and 17 all wanted is one time pass, although still very weak, but can't say that at least is a novice, but this game very easy difficulty makes me deeply realized that I don't even as a rookie, is just a kid  10/10 recommended buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Any more absolutely remember what I wanted to write, so just sign for the pluses and minuses, I loved the game and I would recommend to play it to those who love motorsports.  Pluses:  - Incandescence Brake discs (a trifle, but very nice)  - Drawing of machine parts (though destruction meager and the same, but it looks nice)  - Details of painting (at least to some game I was able to make stripes on the car, change the color and size of disks. Tuning a little, but it's very nice)  - Competent AI (Although I thought that the last circle slows down more opponents, but they drive competently and safely can do so that the next turn you will be standing at the curb)  - Each race - different track. (Literate step from meager repeated tracks)  Minuses (in my opinion):  - Tracks on the rocks (it is simply impossible, they constantly crashes, especially when it is already available sports cars)  - Bug multiplayer? (Oh, you went to the lobby, and the head of the lobby makes five races of 15 minutes, with 3-4 race people begins to come out (from fatigue, etc.), before the last race the last player out and ... great race can not be end when one player, we have to go without the experience and spent an hour the game)  - A sharp transition in sport car (driving quietly at 200km/h, but no, the next season they give me wild Aston Martin with &gt;300km/h)  - Plenty of cars (do not understand why so many cars when each race has a couple cars 'favorite.' Although I carp.)"
It's a very good game! 
"Pretty good game overall, fast smooth handling, quite acradey but makes for a more fun experience."
One of my favourite racing games. I love it. You can choose many different cars which are divided in four classes.
"Awesome game, I'm really enjoying it, but I wish that there was a in cockpit view"
that's feeling of speed
"Very good racing game. It even has splitscreen feature!  In many ways I think this game is better than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, even though Need for Speed has some compelling features and charisma.  I love the menues in Grid 2, because they are fast so I don't get bored. If  there is some information I can always move on as I want. N4S lacked of this.  It's a really creative game with social media, humor and fans. You create a fanbase while competing in your career.  I like the engine sounds in N4S more than in Grid 2, but Grid 2 is really nice anyway.  Grid 2 is more up-to-date, with great online features etc."
It's pretty cool for a quick play
"This game looks great but is greatly flawed. First, the AI is horrid, almost to the point of making the game terribly not fun at times. The computer drivers plow through you and cut across driving lines as though you don't exist, making a true racing experience impossible. Second, you will enjoy the experience much more if you ignore the narrative and overlook the linearity of the game. Third, limiting car choices for specific races is lame. Period.  The game has its good points, but the are dimmed by the many flaws. Grid 2 lacks the polish that you expect from a large company and truly feels unfinished. Buy it on sale for as near as free as you can get it."
"One of my favorite car games on PC, it really is brilliant, plays good, looks good, runs good, what else fo you need ?"
Good Graphic Good Control Nice cars and maps I highly recommend this game.
no cockpit view and all time on traction control!! Drift on FWD Cars&amp;!?!?!?!?
tHIS GAME ABSOLUTLEY SUCKS THE DRIVING IS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU ARE USED TO SIMULATORS THE DRIFTING SUCKS YOU NEED TO PLAY IT ALMOST EVERYDAY TO BE GOOD AT IT -10/10
No... Just DON'T BUY IT.. Buy Race driver : GRID
Great racing game whit nice and fast cars. If you love racing buy this game!
"It's a great game, i got a lot of hours of fun with it. But keep in mind that is an arcade game and not a simulator. The fun here is to control your car drifting like a maniac! "
"Very good game. I miss the cockpit view, but oh well... it's still loads of fun.  Doesn't leave you feeling like a 5-year old toddler making 'Vrooming' noises while smashing Hot Wheel cars together, like some racing games do."
"Beautiful to look at, stunning models. While the driving experience for the first GRID was more realistic, GRID 2 is a little more arcade-y, probably to make it more accessable. Unlike most of the PC competition, especially compared the N4S franchise, you get the sense that this game was made by people who understand love for cars, much like the Forza series. If you're tired of racing games for bro's *cough Need For Speed cough*, this is a pretty decent choice."
"just not a look in on the first grid,could have been so much better but sadly failed to deliver"
"Even if it's not as good as the first GRID, it's still a very good arcade racing game. Worth to buy at steam sales."
"If you aren't really into racing sims, like spectacular crashes and love drifting this the game for you. Although, i have mixed feelings about this because GRID 1 was really different, and for the most part going in the right direction. Also no cockpit view, because they said 'nobody really uses it' .. really? Also what with the dlc out of the ♥♥♥ these days.... like half of cars locked because of DLC..."
So at first I would have scremed to buy this. But after the way CM is doing the DLC and pay to win. Its getting harder. This really feels like a game more focused on making money then anything for the player. Still no proper voice support or even in game chat. MP is just a ♥♥♥♥♥how in the first turns. CM give a free car to everyone and then sells it in a DLC. Save your money.
So far I have barely played it buuuttt... seem super hard to get into for me (I am a fps gamer) and I feel the controls arent super reactive.. but I dont know much about racing games. 7/10
Pros:  -RACE FAST CARS -DRIFFFFFFFFFFFFFTS -IT LOOKS NICE Cons: -The announcers voice is annoying  9.8/10
"A good game, but somehow not as good as Grid 1. It's hard to say why - apart from more of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drift levels, why is it I can powerslide around corners in every race with perfect car control, but in the drift levels the car just spins or massively understeers when I try to do the same thing?  I thought it would be nice to drive a lot of different cars in this game, but there's no cockpit view, and since you have to use the hood cam to get a sense of speed and immediacy, you just end up staring at slightly different paintjobs."
"GRID 2 is a great arcade racing game. The crashes are insane, the races are intense, and it looks excellent on PC. Moreover it presents many interesting car classes and events, the AI is one of the best out there and races are fast and adrenalinic."
good for some hours but not more hours
worst racing game EU
Well designed racing game! Loads of fun even without a steering wheel. Best spent 6eur ever ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°)
DLC's... DLC's everywhere
"This game has really shaken my faith in Codemasters, I got this because I thought I would be playing an improved version of GRID, One of my all time favorite racing games.   'GRID 2 will also set the new standard for multiplayer racing with innovative modes, an entirely separate progression system and deep integration with RaceNet' - Codemasters  That statement is bold and false. There is no multiplayer in this game, and even if you do manage to get in the game theres so many latency issues. Yeah you can change your download region and try to find players but that usually just increases the problems if you do manage to get in a race.  I'm sorry but this game is a farcry from how good GRID was. Its a shame too because it had potential, but there already releasing another GRID game soon, while this game remains broken."
"Damn great racing, beautiful graphics while awesome fps, must have racing game"
THIS IS A BANGER OF A GAME! BEST ARCADE RACER IVE PLAYED FOR A WHILE
"I got this free with my new Intel processer. Needless to say it is a good game. The driving feels smooth.  I liked the classic muscle cars that are included with this game, I wish more games had older cars to race."
This game is quite fun. It may not be as difficult as the first Grid but it still will be a nightmare if all you play is arcade racers. The game looks amazing considering that it is compatible on low hardware. It isn't the most feature rich of racing games but for what it is I found myself enjoying it.
"Best racing game ever, single plater and online well worth the £7ish pound for game and all the DLC but hurry offer ends soon"
"A worthy sequel to GRID, the career mode is expansive and engrossing, however watch out for the slightly predictable AI, and the many aggresive individuals who inhabit its online modes."
It's fun
"While this game is fun, it's not simulator. I bought this thinking I would get a racing game with real physics and racing simulation but this is full on arcade.  If that's what you want, then this game is perfect for your but don't be trumped by the reputation of this series. Go for Grid Autosport instead."
Unlike the first Grid game this has a very Arcade feel about it and does not have the same feeling that the first one had. The game feels like it was rushed with not much thought put in to the gameplay aspect.
Bought this game and didnt even work. robbed AGAIN by steam.
"0/10 no first person, why no trolling allowed online complete bs."
 Just Awesome!
I really like this game i give it a 9 out of 10
"For an arcade fan: You'll have a blast with a huge amount of challenge.  Driving simboys/girls: If you don't take this too seriously, you can have a great time in between those more realistic games you play.  I took this game as pretty pure arcade, and I had great time playing. Graphics are nice, sounds are ok, 'plot' if there can be one mentioned is... ummm... not that interesting, but when you stick to driving, this is a nice game.  9/10"
"Single player is full of the same old 'rookie making it big'... It's so old and boring. Cutscenes and voice over are simply embarrassing. Racing is ok, but no cockpit view and there are no options to change car physics. So if it's too arcadey for you, there is no way to change it. Didn't try multiplayer. "
"i enjoyed this game very much just as an arcade racer, but now that the computer screen doesnt change when i go to world series racing, i cant play the game. If anyone knows how to fix this please message me, but overall a fun arcade racer that feels fast"
"First , i was sceptical about buying this game. I said , what can be better than NFS. Well , Grid2 is ! Awesome graphics , car controll is very good and the game was on SALE ! =))"
One of the best racing games ever made.
awsome :D
"I've been a fan of Codemaster's games ever since the Colin McRae Rally Racing series. While the first GRiD was popular along with the DiRT series, GRiD 2 introduces an entirely new racing experience. The damage physics is slightly downgraded but it still provides an authentic racing experience. If you hit a tree at 120 MPH, you are going to total your car. If you are a fan of racing games, this is a must have."
I am not usually a racing game guy but this game is definitely worth a look. Its realistic enough to keep the hardcores happy and easy enough for casuals to jump in.
"i bought this game and i do not regret it. its really good, and is on kinda a fine line between arcade-y and simulator-ish"
"its not bad for the first 4 seasons but as you progress the opponents NEVER make any mistakes and drive as though they are on rails where as the car you are given has about as much grip as an egg on a nonslip pan totally impossible, but you have to use the car your given and you cant even change any setups for the cars."
"GRID 2 is not a great racer back when it first release, the lack of race discipline variety, road car focus, average driving physic and weak track selection really kills the game. The driving physic in the game is more to the arcade side (more than GRID 1), the tail of the car is constantly out even the GT3 cars cant really take a corner steadily. The game modes included in GRID 2 are Live Route, Endurance, Time Attack, Race, Elimination, Touge, Face Off and Drift.   Career is focus on a new sort of racing series called 'World Series Racing' and you are the star driver in this racing series. In GRID 2, you dont need to buy cars like GRID 1, whenever you require a new car to particpate a race event, the game will let you pick 1 car out of 2. The car that you didnt picked can be unlocked later in the game by joining one of the events. There are sponsors event that have races such as overtake and endurance as well.   Even with all DLCs, the game still feels empty in comparison to GRID 1. The DLCs adds 2 new tracks which is Spa and Bathurst, the DLCs tracks are great but 2 great tracks cant really save the poor tracks selection from the base game. As for the DLC cars, the AIs wont use them. You will always be the only driver driving it and there are a few weird car classing for the DLC cars. For example the Ford Sierra is class with the modern Volvo S60 for some reason. The drift cars can be used in normal racing mode but those cars lack of top speed. Another example is the Tier 3 cars, the Ariel Atom and Caterham SP300R could easily outrun the typical supercars like Aston Martin Vanquish and Mclaren 12C.   The only good thing I found in GRID 2 is the splitscreen option, it is great when you have friends to race with.  I'll suggest getting GRID 1 instead of GRID 2, it may be old but it plays a lot better. GRID 2 will be suitable for you if you dont mind the drifty driving physics."
"Fun, exciting and still enjoyable after a year. great visuals and fast racing with some beauttiful cars. Great tracks and awesome multiplayer. Cannot wait for its 2014 sequel: Grid Autosport. Grid 2 is great"
"All in all, pretty good.   I have to admit that the game has been a little glitchy, with my rig crashing an average of once every 45 minutes, but for some reason I keep coming back. Anti-aliasing settings seem to be part of the problem, and once I dialed them in a bit it seems to run a lot better now.  There is something about the ambience, the quiet music and the feel of nostalgia. Starting out in your own suburbian garage? A world racing league? It grows on you, fast. The story is not so in-depth that it gets in the way. (I mean you, NFS: Undercover!) Some may say over-simplistic; if you are into being able to control every little setting on your car than this is not for you, but if you like feeling like you are part of the story, than GRID 2 is..."
"Fun game so far. My only complaint is in the AI. The computer drivers seem to be basically immune to ANY car damage whatsoever, and also do not appear to follow the same crash physics as players. I cant tell you how many times I've pushed the rear end of a computer during a slide, only to have them perfectly counter-steer and be unaffected. Yet, I am like a feather in the wind; during any turn or drift, just about any contact will set you into a tail slide, forcing you to mash backspace over and over and over :("
This game rocks! It takes racing to a whole new level of challenges and styles. Over all a great game!
"Fun game pretty good deal for $12.49 couldn't pass this Racing genre. Great Graphics, gameplay, cars, but I still miss GRID 1's original cockpit view as to the 2nd version lacking it :( Just a way of lazyness on the developers part. They took it out using a 1% users use cockpit view shouldn't matter it's a racing game all racing games should have this view no questions asked. Multiplayer is a blast especially bringing back Destruction Derby. Single player would be ok if they didn't make the opponents over powering like when you want to make them wreck they have way too much power over you from making it possible you either have to go 100mph to side swipe them to even get into any collision, other than that good luck trying at any other speed, please make this an option or fix, thank you. Other than that the game is worth the money especially the sale we had."
"It's a very enjoyable racing game, but has its ups and downs. I actually got into the original GRID very late, having picked it up on sale a few months before I bought GRID 2. The handling and the gameplay is very similar in both titles, even the drifting, in my opinion. Yes, there is a lack of in-the-seat first-person perspectives, which is a shame (even though there are no-car 1PV and over-the-hood 1PV); though to be honest I have always been a 3PV player when it comes to racing games so it was of no consequence to me.  The base price of the game is steep, though, as is the $30+ for the DLC. I picked up both during the Steam Christmas sales for a total of ~$25, which I think it a fantastic deal.  The campaign mode is a lot more linear and simplistic than the original GRID, though. You no longer have the ability to hire on an additional driver to your racing team, which is something I miss. Rather, you essentially just beat other racers to gain popularity for Callahan's World Series Racing ... thing. And then beat them again the the actual WSR. The AI in the single player is pretty simplistic as well, and follows very predictable driving lines (and will predictably crash into you without a care in the world), and usually brake far too early. Getting through the campaign on normal difficulty will make you better than a lot of the players you find in multiplayer though &gt;.&gt;  The multiplayer is a whole other deal. You buy cars with money you win in races, which is fine, but unfortunately there's also a leveling system applied. And it's VERY much a grind. I've been playing a lot since I got the game ~3 weeks ago, and I'm only at level 12 of 99. You can't even start unlocking Tier4 cars until you hit level 20-something, so prepare to play Tier1 and Tier2 a lot, unless you're happy with crappy loaner cars in T4 (or... buy DLC). It will take you something like 20 races just to get to level 2. Thankfully, there is also an enjoyable Global Challenges system that will give you a needed XP boost, but it only cycles weekly. DLC can give you an edge, but at the same time hosts of custom games can just turn DLC off, so ... yeah.  Speaking of DLC: Yes, I picked up the All-In DLC pack while it wa on 66% off, which was a good deal. Here is my general take on the packs: - The Spa Francorchamps pack is worth it for the track alone. Haven't had much time with the cars to make an opinion on 'em. - The Bathurst track pack is kind of meh. - Demo Derby is fun and free. - Peak Performance Pack looks like it's a bad deal, but is actually decent. In the MP, you can upgrade cars to make them perform better. If you upgrade them fully, they get ranked a Tier higher than usual. The Peak Performance cars are all Tier1 cars upgraded into Tier2, BUT these DLC 'performance' cars actually perform a bit better than their counterparts if they get fully upgraded. Thus, a fully upgraded Volkswagen Golf R in Tier2 will be slightly worse than a 'Golf R (Performance)'. Additionally, some of these cars are ones you'd want to have in both tiers anyway. - The Classic Grid pack gives you two very enjoyable Tier4 cars from the original GRID, but I'm not convinced that they're necessarily better. The DLC Koenigsegg CCGT is significantly slower than the Koenigsegg Agera R (which is the fastest GRID2 car in the game). Not bad cars, though. - The IndyCar is pretty nice, but you're not going to find a lot of ppl using it much. - No opinions on the rest."
"The Good  - Exceptional Physics  - New style of racing events  - Stable and Stunning Graphics  The Bad  - Awful audio quality  - Annoying lens-flare  - Horrible video upload system  - Repetitive and Boring gameplay  - Lack of any customization  Final Score: 5/10  Codemasters missed the mark, again, with GRID 2."
"Amazing Racing Game! 9,5/10. The only thing that i don't like about this game is the AI, feels like all the AI Cars are helping the #1 AI Car in the Race win the Race by blocking your way and basically creating a barrier for you. Other than that this Game is simply amazing and really satisfying to play!"
A good classic racing game. Kinda simple with lots of fun and lots of sweet wagons.
Nice racing game.. but cutscenes are way too long and you cant pass those.
"Vastly improved graphics over the original, a great and fun racing game!"
"Massive fun, it's 50% Arcade and 50% simulation but all in all extremely well made game.  Loads of racing and not as boring as racing on the ciructs.  Had Grid before but this one is just perfect racer for my steering wheel."
love it. best racing game out on pc right now. until project cars that is. we shall see though.
"This game is excellent.  Pretty cars, lovely environments and a pretty good driving experience.  I too have experienced the 'aggressive AI' but in my opinion its less that they're aggressive and more that they stick to their racing line regardless of what you do and thus end up causing you to spin out and go off track often.  Still, super fun game."
Awesome game.... Worth buying it.
"Love racing games, this is easily now one of my favourites."
"Bought this game when it was on sale a while back. I have the original Grid game for 360 and loved it and decided to get this game after buying a PC racing wheel. This game is pathetic compared to the first. Almost all the cars are only available through DLC. While the tracks are interesting and the support for force feedback racing wheels is a plus, it's still very disappointing. Graphics are ok but the physics and damage models are pathetic.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this game at sale price, much less at full price. Grid 1 is much, much better. Can't say I'll be buying anymore from them."
"Great game!! Arcade is more than we expected, but if you need something very funny and very addictive online. 100% recommended."
"This game is amazing. The mechanics are near flawless, though may require some getting used to. This game is not an exact simulator, but more of a mix between an arcade, drift racer and a racing sim. However, I find this game to have the perfect balanceof these two subtypes of racing in just the perfect way."
"I expected more, and so the first part I liked more than the second("
"I hate racing games but there are 2 series out of that gerne that i adore. Dirt (not the showdown crap) and Grid. Fastpaced, lots and lots of cars and tracks, multiple categories, amazing graphics and addictive gameplay. Nothing comes without flaws though and there are a couple technical mistakes in Grid 2. Is it worth 45 euro (reloaded edition), probably not but you can find it in steam sale for a LOT less. Would recommend!"
"I would not recommend this game to anyone. Pretty graphics, but that's it. Undrivable (only driftable) cars and annoying 'story'. First game on Steam that has managed to disappoint me enough to write a negative review."
This is a full throttle driving simulator no sunday drivers welcome here quality game
"good game ,but more car more good :v"
"I would recommend this game to all the people that are a fan or racing. Grid 2 has cars from different tiers, so lets say you like classic cars and another likes sports cars. Grid 2 includes all of that, especially the realistic crashing and racing graphics. The details are what make a game popular, and this game shows a potential chance of that happening for first-time players."
"Wicked game! awesome graphics and great realistic car handling, not totaly SIM, but not like NFS underground lol"
"I bought Grid 2 on HumbleBundle for $1 along with some other Codemasters titles. But, I'm just playing this one and it rocks. Nice balance of arcade-simulation, gorgeous graphics on my 3year old laptop. This might as well be my best ever Steam buy!!!"
2/10
Nice Game.
"The sequel to my favorite racing game ever, i was slightly dissapointed. It was a good game, and enjoyable, but after the decade it took after the first i expected more. The lack of demo derbies is upsetting, but it is still a very fun game."
"Gorgeous graphics, and good racing physics. Been looking for a good racing game for a while. I found it."
"Very nice game, only rammers are stupid."
"It's an okay game. The graphics are very nice, some new races. But it's too arcadie. I was hoping for some realistic racing. So if you're a kid who doesn't know how to drive. Play this game. Sadly I got bored of it a lot faster. the first game was fantastic, I was disappointed to see they got rid of the interior view."
"I recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a nice action packed, semi-realistic race game. I've got GRID 2 for my PS3 and PC, and it's much better on PC. Not only because of the graphics, but there is no lag while playing single player and i haven't experienced it online."
"This is Grid - but better. A touch on the arcade side rather than simulation by default, the damage, control and assist settings let you balance this just the way you want, rather than forcing a style you don't like. It's a bit drifty to begin, but then I love that! An excellent game."
"This game was a huge disappointment for a number a reasons, the biggest being the driving experience which focuses almost exclusively on drifting. The graphics are acceptable but for the price you'd expect much better. The use of a story line is obnoxious. The boring, senseless plot serves only to force you to complete challenges in order to unlock new vehicles and tracks. You get the sense the developers where locked in a room with nothing but a case of Red Bull and the entire Fast &amp; Furious DVD collection until they spat out this game. I actually like their Formula 1 games so it's hard to believe this one was so far off the mark."
"it's a pretty cool game, and will be even better if you have a steering wheel. :)"
good game and online is fun and fast
"One of the best racing games i've played. Only minus is that GRID 2 visual part is not up-to-date, thats all."
Charts a nice course along the border of arcade and simulation. Online play is an absolute RIOT. One of the best new racing games for 2013.  Arcmanov Approved. *thumbs up*
"Having played the game, this was how I pictured the creation of this game: Fresh off the success of the the original Race Driver: GRID, Codemasters decided to have a look at the rest of the multi-platform, half-arcade-half-realistic racing games market to see what the competition was like. So they picked up a copy of Need for Speed: Shift - which they stopped playing after half an hour because of how terrible it was, but not before they had a good look at the driving mechanics and the physics engine. Enraged by the fact that 30 minutes of their time was wasted in such a manner, Codemasters decided to make a game that had the same glossy sheen as the Need for Speed franchise, but used its own assets and physics engine, and thus GRID 2 was born.  Okay, so it doesnt really have the same sheen as a Need for Speed game, but it does feel like someone took a Need for Speed game, ripped out the internals and put in brand new and much more functional parts.  Things got off to a bad start when, like the original GRID, the game throws you into a race at an unknown track and asks you to begin driving - with no knowledge of the controls nor the track itself. I found out that WASD was used rather than the more conventional cursor keys as the default driving keys. This made the race not so much challenging as near impossible without immediately changing the controls once the game starts.  Heading off from there, the game is entertaining and is an excellent racing game. There are many more race modes in here than in GRID and compared to SHIFT, and I like the increased customisation options available for the cars.  However, the cars selection feels a bit.... anaemic. There are definitely more cars, just not much variation, especially when you dont include the DLC cars. Vehicle handling also feels rather challenging: it is unbelieveably easy to lose the back end of a car in a corner and either spin out or drift around the corner. The game balances it out by making controlling the drift easy, but this becomes extremely difficult and eventually frustrating when you reach the much faster, higher tier cars, where just a bump in the road causes the front and back end of the car to switch around. Track selection feels rather weak too. Sure, you get a handful of excellent tracks such as Indy, the Red Bull Ring and Brands Hatch, and there are a good variation of street-based tracks. But its rather sad that tracks featured in the original GRID such as Donnington Park and Le Mans to name a few, were excluded from the game. You can get some more race tracks such as the excellent Bathurst and Spa-Francochamps via DLC, as if to further rub salt in the wound.  The AI appears to drive with the same behaviour as in the original GRID: With extreme tunnel vision. These are drivers who refuse to check their mirrors, refuse to give you space and will move in front or into your car when you are passing by. Speaking of which, your car, like in GRID, feels like its made of styrafoam whereas the opponents feel like they're weighed down with depleted uranium, so any bumps into them will result with your car bouncing off them into the nearest wall while they carry on with no change in their vehicle path.  Overall GRID 2 is still a competent racing game despite all its flaws and people who like driving games with a dash of arcade-style physics will still have a blast with this game. But this doesnt feel like the outstanding sequel which the original GRID deserved."
"The coolest racing game of TOCA Series. finally, welcome back to racing!!!"
This game has really beautiful graphics compared to other racing games And new UI Looks good Last time I played there was no support for Controllers. Now I Can use my G27 and Xbox360 controller easily!
""
"I have spent many years playing racing games from the arcade style Need for Speed series to the in depth Gran Turismo series, which is by far my favorite. I no longer play console games, I'm strictly PC. That means I'm searching for a game which can satisfy my Gran Turismo need. I own several racing games for PC such as Grid 1, Shift 2, Dirt series, Need for Speed, and I only use an Xbox One controller. Grid 2 has become my goto racing game when I have time to sit down and spin some tires.  I have heard that Shift 2 is better, but so far I have not been able to get into it. After work and time with my family, I don't have a lot of time for gaming. So when I finally have a moment to race, Grid 2 is where I turn.   Gamepad control works well, it is challenging enough to keep me engaged while not being so realistic that I get frustrated since I don't have a wheel. The visuals are excellent and that includes vehicle damage. Plenty good enough to please my tastes."
"Great driving game, expect a challenge ;)"
"Really enjoy this came on the PC. I had this on PS3 and there was a lot of issues with framerate that made the game not fun to play. It is really beautiful looking, the audio is fantastic, and the arcade/realistism of the game make for a good experiance."
worest game ever when it comes to relatity - complete joke
Stop looking at this and find the first GRID.
"this is a great game, once it has more carrear then this is awesome."
"Arcade racers are always a tough game to review. Sim lovers immediately hate them. Action game lovers wonder why there aren't more guns and blood. Car lovers wonder why everything is exploding and breaking and the cars are swerving purposely all over the road. Arcade racer lovers know how much incredible fun can be had playing a gem title like this though. To date, this is my favorite Arcade racer for PC. The rewind function alone is brilliant. But the graphics cars, silly, yet kinda realist physics are all amazing and still look great on new hardware."
"Solid arcade racer in the flavour of Bizarre's old MSR/PGR games, works well with a g27 or xbox pad, highly recomended for some online fun with friends. Inclusion of split screen is a bonus, shame there isn't offline LAN play but I guess that's just the direction of things!  I prefer this to Grid Autosport, lots of accessible fun and far easier to persuade non-racers to play!"
"Original Grid was very hard for me, handling wise. But found this one just right for me. Game looks great. Driving feels good. DLC content seems too much spread over multiple DLC's, but I got Reloaded Edition during Summer Sale, so not much complaint about that. But still cars in 1 DLC, tracks in 1 DLC should would have made it much better. "
"Seemed nice while I only had access to slow cars.  All started getting ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier after season 2 of WSR.  Pros: The graphics look great.  Cons: * AI always run on max speed in corners without starting to drift or spinout and the car type only changes how YOUR car handles, * Controls of this game are awful: even when using analog input, it's either max or zero turn left/right, * Some events don't allow to make a contact with other cars - it doesn't matter who hits who, you always get disqualified for that, * You're drifting 100% of the time: even when going without acceleration in corners, if you turn to the side, the car starts drifting.  Basically it's impossible to play this game if you don't get a good racing wheel for your PC. I started playing on medium difficulty, but in season 2 had to change to easy and in season 3 changed to very easy, as the cars got more and more uncontrollable, while the opponents were going at max speed with no control issues."
"I'm not gonna make yet another review of this game... suffice it to say: I like it! It took me quite some time to get used to drifting... I'm more a grip and racing line kinda guy... but I like the variety of cars and the fact that they all take some getting used to. Not so keen on certain tracks, though ( HK... WTF§§) and i deplore the absence of some classic tracks (Silverstone, anyone? or let's dream, Donington, Snetterton...) All in all a good game.. defo a keeper. BUT (there has to be one) The online multiplyer SUCKS! Not technically... cars and tracks are great but as long as the game keeps on rewarding bullies and cheats, there's no way you'll be able to even get a ♥♥♥♥ing podium... no matter how good you get... the tracks are unforgiving enough as it is but if you add all the idiots charlied and modded up to the eyebrows to the point they forgot where the brakes are or even what a brake IS.... well that makes the experience somehow less enjoyable. ... still playing, though..."
Honestly one of the funnest games I've ever played. It is worth way more than $30.
"As a racing game, its ok. Feels like Grid was more fun and easier to play.   Cars slide all over the place, game loosing corner cutting penalties.  Played online, its good. Lots of options.  If you want a racing game to play with mates, this isn't too bad. But if you want a single player game go for the first Grid"
I can only recommend this game.
"This game is great for everyone, and even if you don't like drifting, you will love this drifting game, it is endless fun and even funner with a friend."
"One of the best racing games i've ever played, fun, realistic but yet has a good arcade feel to it"
THIS GAME IS SO BAD LIKE OHMYLORD YOU CANT EVEN GO INTO COCKPIT VIEW LIKE M8 WAT. THE FIRST GRID IS A BILLION TIMES MORE GOOD. THX 4 LISTENING
"It's like a over-hyped need for speed with superbly unrealistic handling, all you need to do in order to win is drift! However I still found this game throughly enjoyable with the selection of vehicles, race modes and nice tracks it delivers but would only reccomend picking it up if it's on sale."
"Pretty fun. The graphics are good, as well as gameplay. It may take a while to get use to many cars in the game, but it's worth it."
No cockpit.  Awful Driving Physics.  Get Autosport.
"If you liked Grid, you will love Grid 2. Very cool, great graphics. Love it."
"A pretty good game for all you hardcore racing fans out there. Gives me a real challenge unlike some other racing games I have reviewed (the crew). It also gives you an amazingly awesome variety of different things to do and how you want your cars to look. They even have a demolition derby DLC for free, which I probably use the most."
"Grid 2 is a very good game for arcade racers, this game is not a good simulator however even sim racers will have a good time with this one. This is honestly one of my favorite games of all time and I highly recomend it. 10 out 10 easy"
A fun game with good graphics and enough content to keep you busy for a long time . Very weak multiplayer .
"Got four cars in less than an hour and they all feel about the same. GT2 and GT3 on the playstation were so awesome they've ruined me from all other racing games out there so far. Also, wtf is up with you starting out in a massively torquy RWD car for the first races when you're trying to get the feel for the physics in the game? Stupid. Start players out in an AWD or something and then go from there."
"Grid II is very good game , beginnings are difficult but this is not problem . Grafic 10/10 ."
38 Minutes before I quit. I didn't like being pigeonholed into RWD drift setups. I may try it another day.
"Pretty good, I never really liked racing games but this game changed my mind."
weakest grid title
"The new career mode sucks. They took out the team management part from GRID, which was so good. The racing is still as good as it was in GRID, but man the meta-game is no longer interesting to me. Just stick with GRID."
"Overall, if you like driving games, this is worth a playthrough despite its flaws. I'm referring here to the offline career mode as (with the exception of TDU2) I've never really been one for online racing.   The game splits cars into four tiers, so that the advantages gained from picking any particular car are limited. Tier one plays well, if feeling a little slow at times. Tiers two and three are the high point of the game, and are a lot of fun to drive. The problem comes when one advances to tier four. These are the fastest cars in the game, but are twitchy and difficult to control. The advantages from correct car selection here also make few options viable. Whils tier four can be mastered with practice, I found myself playing through these levels more to complete the game/achievements than for actual enjoyment.  The gameplay itself is pretty good; cars do have their own distinct character, and flashbacks ('do-overs') help keep the game moving (even if they are frowned upon by the most hardcore of racing community). The AI could use some improvement- there seems to be a pretty steep difference between levels. There are several locations, each with different tracks, and both the cars and their surrondings are visually impressive.  There are several modes of racing within the game; standard races, elimination events, time trials, drifting, etc. This breaks the monotomy that racing games can sometimes fall into. My only complaint on this subject is touge racing. Touge involves one-on-one races where contact results in automatic disqualification. I can see why the developers have done so (to avoid players exploiting the AI) but it feels like any contact (regardless of who is at fault) results in the player being penalised. There events are not very frequent so this is not a huge problem, but it is somewhat annoying to be disqualified on the final corner after being hit by your opponent.  Customisation is a little disapointing; whilst the full livery customisation remains from the original GRID, upgrading car setups is only avaliable in online mode. Additionally, whilst being given a full choice of sponsors, most yield the same result for meeting their criteria. The racing team of the first game is also gone, meaning there is no option to pick your own team mate, etc.   The only other issue I had was finding the game dropped frames on occassion (and this became frustratingly frequent near the end), but this may well be a problem with my set up rather than the game itself.  Despite some of these points, I'd still recommend GRID 2 as one of the better racing games on the market."
the things that i dont like with this game is DLC and Car setup...you acn not play with your friends without ttem...its either you quit or you download it.
"A fun,challenging racing game with a good leveling system, only problem is that there is rarely anyone on the servers which you need for some unlocks."
love the game most fun ive had in a long time
Great game from codemasters! Looks great as well. Not a full racing simulation game but I think is what makes it a little more fun to play!
"This game is great. Lets get the obvious points out of the way though. This game is GORGEOUS and even runs well on my crappy laptop, which is always a plus. And the gameplay is brilliant. I highly suggest a gamepad, just like for any racing game. Analog controls are great for racing games, but this one has fairly decent keyboard controls as well. The saving grace for this game which pushes it over the top of other racing games of this quality is the flashbacks. Though not as good in multiplayer, the flashbacks are absolutely brilliant in Singleplayer, allowing you to learn from your mistakes as you go along with the race. Also means that you won't have to go to the menu every time you have a big crash. Overall, this is a very well-polished racing game with some great features that makes it better than others. 8.5/10 for Singleplayer 7.5/10 for Multiplayer"
Great game!!!!
Realy nice and funny game :)  Like the drifting at this game. Like the cars. But you cant really 'pimp' ur car that mutch only wheels and decals. But nice game :P 
4/10
"Not as good as grid 1, the drifting is crap compared to grid1,"
"4/10 This game can be very fun, but the AI can not detect you AT ALL, they will brake when they are in front of you, so you can not move, they will smash into you with full force when they want, sometimes you can not even finish a race because the ♥♥♥♥ing stupid AI can not detect you, this game took a lot of effort, but when it came to the AI they did no work at all, oh I forgot to mention, online servers are only in your area, not public, so you can never find anyone online unless you live in the UK or USA. However this game can be tremendously fun arcade drift racer, and if you know how to do good handbrake turns, you will dominate ... oh nevermind, your drift was ruined by the ♥♥♥♥ing AI who is braking at the wrong time as ussual, however if you have a lot of patience, this game will be the best racing game ever. Changng dificulty makes almost no difference at all, because you cant finish the race because of the AI in front of you"
Nice game :)
Amazing game! Online full of rammers but still great but the SLR and AGERA cars could be GRIP cars
"The story mode in this racing game is like many, okay. You can name the character, and take controle in the drivers seat. The best costimising in the game is for the cars, you can do so much to them and it is great."
"After buying GRID 1, I feel like I should change my opinion about this game.  Compared to GRID 1, this feels like the Shortened Version of GRID 1. No cockpit view, the narrator is terribly tedious, less cars, extremely lack of car customisation. AI in both games are stupid, but since GRID 2 is newer, I really expect the AI to be a lot better, nope, not one bit however. This game is not a racing simulator anymore, its just an arcade racing game, unrealistic. The money system is replaced with a fan earning stuffs. It's not really fun you cannot use the fans you earned to do other things like buying vehicle, it's pointless.  This game is really good; I really tried to like the game, got all DLCs, but no. It lacks too much thing in the game, and I refused to like the game. Buy it only when it's on a huge sale."
"Wicked game! awesome graphics and great realistic car handling, not totaly SIM, but not like NFS underground lol"
Good game with serious bugs. Keeps jumping out of the game into windows mid race at random.
"Theres hardly any racing games on PC nowadays so I decided to pick this up. I guess its fine as an arcade racer, but its nothing more to it than that. I was hoping it would be more like a racing sim like Gran Turismo, but its not. The handling of the cars can get really annoying and its like the game wants you to drift all of the time. This can get annoying on tracks where the corners are not as sharp and require slight movements. The visuals of the game are good. The most annoying part of the game is its focus on 'modern' trends. For example it frequently wants to remind you about camera-phones and social media. I died a little inside when it gave me an acheivment labeled, 'SWAGtastic'. Stuff like this left a sour taste in my mouth. I also think the whole point of the single player campaign to be about gathering 'fans' is kinda shallow. Is my character some sort of fame hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?  All in all, its a good racer if you just want to have a fun arcade style experience. While it wasn't the game I hoped it would be, fun can still be had. If I gave this game a score I'd give it a 7/10."
Multiplayer system -1
"Great to play online with your friends, highly recommended by me!"
"Unforynatly i cannot say nothing about this game rather than it looks very nice. I can run this game for about 2 minutes and then i loose all input on my keyboard so i cannot reset it or nothing, all i can do is turn the whole computer down by the main reset button, not a vary good option at all. All drivers are upto date using driver detective, Looks like it needs serious patching for top end machines, very very dissapointing indeed. Purchased in steam sale, not a good bargain for me cant be used at all. Using it on windows 7, I7, Alienware Area 51, 12g ram."
well.......you can rewind your noob moves...haha
"For all you Arcade gamers out there. This is a winner. The gameplay is much the same as in the first grid, though it has improved in my opinion. Great selection of cars, ♥♥♥♥ing awesome multiplayer and really good graphics. It's really fun to play with your friends."
Great game
"This game is loads of fun to play with friends if your not to serieus about it, its more like a street style racer than that it is a simulator"
Can I get a refund? This isn't even fun. GRID original was ten times better. There isn't even a cockpit view?? What a waste of money.
best racing game
best racing game for me
"I've found 20 hours of enjoyment in GRID 2, though I am a die-hard fan of any racing game released by Codemasters (Dirt Showdown notwithstanding, nobody likes Dirt Showdown). The base game is fun, good-looking, challenging and satisfying, and there can be a lot of fun had with a couple of friends online. Definite recommendation.  One word of warning about this game though - to me NONE of the DLC is worth the money you'll pay, even on sale. Currently, you'll pay £3.50 for the luxury of one extra car and being able to drive around Yas Marina in the daytime. I think not."
All I wanted to do was jump onto a game and race some cars. There isn't even an internal view (that I can find). This is a driving game. It is literally only about cars and they didn't include interiors. C'mon guys. Step it up.
its ok. i wouldnt spring out of bed to go play it
""
Nice game
verry nice game.is so realistic.i recomend it!
The most fun race game i have play try it :)
it's dirty 
"Generally, the graphics are truly wonderful and pleasing to the eye. There weren't any moments while playing where something hurt my eyes. The cars look nice, as well, and the livery options have a large variety of choice. The racing environments are very well detailed and surprisingly open/expansive. Not only that, but one of my favorite graphical features is the fact that it is not always the same time of day from one race to another.  The controls are a bit different of a story. The controls (mostly steering) seem a bit more sensitive than they should be. Not only that, but I can't seem to be able to locate any sort of option for changing steering sensitivity, if there is one.  Another problem I have with this game when compared to the first is probably one of the most prominent features of the GRID series: flashbacks. In all honesty, a flashback system, in my eyes, is pretty interesting. It gives a chance for redemption if you've made a mistake. Unfortunately, this feature has been changed, and it feels as if it's an attempt by a knock-off game to implement this mechanic. For one, you cannot navigate through the flashback to find the exact spot you messed up. It has become pressing a button and hoping you hit it again in the right place to fix a mistake you made, if that makes any sense.  Another problem is the artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence of the other racers seems somewhat independent of the player. It kind of takes out the feel of the game as a true racing career simulator. Although, this isn't the worst thing ever.  A personal issue I have with this game is the apparent lack of any voice other than your manager (I think). The voice acting for this character, though, was cast well, and the role really adds some realism to the game.  Here's an issue I have with this game that I haven't seen a lot of other reviewers address. Sound. First off, the man who speaks to you during races talks FAR too little in order for the game to feel like you're really in a racing simulator. At times, it begins to feel like the lines he says are recycled over and over again. Another issue that I would also say gets neglected in the reviews is the music. The music just seems so unfitting for a game like GRID 2, especially when the music for the original GRID fit so well. Not only that, but oh boy... THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY HIGH-PITCHED SOUNDS IN THE MUSIC. I often find myself wanting to take my headphones off because of how high-pitched some of these sounds are.  Now, there seem to be a large amount of city-based courses in the early parts of the game. This is fine and all, but when you have players whose computers are lagged by all of the detail of cities, it kind of spoils the gameplay.  Overall, I enjoy it (after having crashed into a tree on the first race...). Decent sequel. I had a lot of enjoyment from the first, and this game feels pretty familiar. Despite that, the original GRID, as other reviews have stated, is far superior on most aspects. I still would recommend this game just for fun.  Just as a fair warning before you play this game, racing games don't really work too well when the control scheme is keyboard based. If you're going to play Grid 2, I STRONGLY recommend some sort of controller with a USB."
"If you don't know much about car handling you may want to consider getting this game! If you don't mind racing online with 5-year old grown ups go get it! If you are a 5-year old &lt;&lt;please&gt;&gt; get it!  So what makes GRID 2 special is that it is old and you may be able to find it for a good deal. A few points below: + Good graphics + Quite some tracks + Many cars + Multiplayer actually seems to work better then in GRID Autosport (shorter waiting times, easy to join a playlist,...) - It appears that at least half of online racers are indeed 5 year old grown ups - Can handling is... well let's not talk about it... ARCADE  Check out the videos below:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMfW3Zteco&amp;list=PL1PUkgVzQJU4jBFaAp2c6NY4oYaHYSFa2 "
amazing game! played it for 4 hours when it was given out for free and loved every moment of it.  im on a mac from 2010 and I can run this in ultra settings with an avarage of 28 - 40 fps! a full recomendation for this game i cant think of any better racer.
dude..what an amazing game so far. i hear controller input isn't that great atm but on the wheel this ♥♥♥♥ is sick!!!
"I tried so hard to get this game to work for me. I love racing games and this game had good reviews. The handling in this game is absurd. I can't get past the first race and I am good with racing games. I watched youtube videos because I figured I was doing something wrong, but it STILL feels like I'm on ice the whole time.....on easy mode. I really wish they had a setting for the sensitivity of the buttons, specifically left and right. Wow...I wish I could have my money back. Or at least have the devs adjust the sensitivity so the game is playable. I truely feel that this game was a waste of time and money."
Offers a great sense of speed and isnt packed full of LAMBOOGEENEEZ and BOOGAADEEZ. It actually has some decent cars like the silvia and E30. However the online is completely dead so consider that when purchasing.
I feel like I am driving semi trucks half the time
This game is not the best simulator . But is fun as hell racing is more like drifting around corners more than anything breaking is fine hand breaks are to over powered in most cars at first its hard to get use to but you get the hang of pretty quick   ps  damage system is horrrible
IT DIDNT HAVE A FREE PLAY MODE!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(just buy the original grid 1. not much has changed if anything. its much better
its ♥♥♥♥ing horrible
I have been playing this game since January 2014 and have to say that I love it. What I don't like so much is that to be competetive in the global events you have to spend more and more money to get competitive cars. I would think it's enough that you have outlayed a hefty price to buy the game but then if you are a serious racer like me you still have to keep spending.
"This game was a suprisingly fun racing game, an they have a demo derby dlc for free so lets ne honest here thats pretty great"
"if you're looking for a good racing simulation game, this one is not for you.  but if you're looking for some good casual racing to enjoy it should do it   ps. I'm just a noob who always drive in AT because MT is too hard"
BEst car Racing Reality Driving
One of the good racing games. I play this when i get bored in NFS world. I like the simulation of this game.
"This is one of the kind of racing game i'm looking for~ It have splitscreen option, customization,Variety of cars and maps, and so pleasing graphic! But, in the eyes of consumer(me)~why you(developer) must seperate the DLC? the DLC isn't really worth it :( but without the DLC the game will get bored quick and voids. The rest are so fine, This co-op/splitscreen is the reason you enjoy playing this game~ especially you are in home playing with your mates. Joystick are soo recommend!  90% Come mate try beat me on splitscreen~"
It is a Blast
"A fun game. Nice cars, nice tracks, not too easy. Great gameplay. Except i didnt play 100 hours on this"
Grid 2 is one of my favorite racing games so far. The graphics are to please and same with the gameplay. It gets really addicting really fast and also it takes a while to beat the game so theres always something to do. It also can be challenging which I really like. I recommend this game! 8.5/10
"Do not ge this game! I have been a avid player of GRID and had loads of fun drifting and open wheeling around. In GRID 2 they have taken 8 steps backwards. The physics are absolute crap, they charge you extra for any cars you would really want, and the tracks are porrly designed and way way way too short. Save your money and anger and buy the first GRID. The drifting in this game (which was heavly advertised) is so damn horrible, i really can't complain enough. Dear lord do not buy this game. Codemasters you have failed the car/racing community. God you guys really messed this series up."
"I personally really like this game, and I don't see why so many people are giving it bad reviews. I have played DiRT 2 and DiRT 3, and if you like those series then this game wouldn't be bad to try at all. This game is more fast paced than the DiRT series though, and the AI is tons better. On very hard difficulty it is certainly a challenge, and on hard it's still a bit too easy. The only bad thing I can say is that online racing is dead, and there's no cockpit view. Maybe this game isn't worth the entire 30 bucks, but that's only 'cause I find the DLCs to be kind of pricey. All in all, if this game is on sale and you're a fan of racing games, try GRID 2. I use a controller (too broke for a wheel and too much to set up) and I love the handling and feel of the cars. It is a little bit arcadey, and I do admit DiRT 2 feels better, but I'd say it's still passable as a racing sim."
"Good game, shame its too short."
"It's what happened if Namco commissioned Codemaster to make RR: Unbounded, left it halfway and then kept on developing it."
"This game has atleast decent singleplayer campaign, not that good but enough to pace your mind in racing. It has good graphics and control is bit sturdy but its main flaw is its multiplayer, First of all in multiplayer, you will find few players racing and secondly while playing you will feel you are gettting bugged and somehow they past you and you will eventually invisible to them and you will ended in last with no reason, I dont know whats the real problem though but thats just my opinion, either this game mp sucks or my internet.. so at end I willl give 4.9/10, thats the score this game will get according to me...."
"Fun for a while, but doesn't do anything particularly well. It's pretty generic for a Codemasters game.  6 / 10"
"Decent game, has a great amount of depth to it. The cars handle really well. The online is still really active which is pretty rare for an old game and there is tons of DLC available for it."
The feel of control is terrible
nice graphic.. :v
"Very fun game, sound design is top notch as well runs very smoothly. Accelleration control is also fairly precise, you can maintain a specific RPM in a given gear, which is a lot of fun. I'm not a fan of racing sims, and I dislike games that have an arcade racing feel.   Definitely recommend, but get the DLC when it's on sale."
"This is an overall good buy but not for $30, wait for it to go on sale.  This game uses a seperate unlock system for campaign and multiplayer so it is very frustrating when you want to play with friends but only have a view cars unlocked."
great game get it and play with me
"This may not be the racing game you are looking for, so I'd read up on it before buying.  Definitely not anywhere near a simulation game - the handling feels exagerated, there is no in car view, there is far too much drifting in pretty much every car and the story mode seems to be obsessed with social media to an embarasing extent. Apparently the online mode is pretty much dead, but I've not really tried it. The DLC seems poorly implemented too - the (numerous) DLC packs add new tracks and game modes, yet those new tracks are only available in free race, not in the story mode.  There is a good reason to own this game though - it has a fantastic split screen mode. I enjoy playing arcade racers against people who are in the room with me, and this is one of the best I've come across on PC. If you're like me and looking for decent PC split screen games, I'd recomend picking the complete package up. It's also a good game to have if you're looking for a casual racing game to play single player.  If you're a serious racing gamer this is probably not one you'd want to buy."
Great graphic! Not too easy
"Overall not as good as the original GRID, gameplay is good, but the story of world series racing just sux!  GRID Autosport is better."
I definitely like this game.
best car graphics 10 out 10 ign game of the year
lots of options for lots of different race types...pretty good game
Lovely game ! Thx !
"If you remove everything driving-related from GRID, and add a storyline - then you'll get GRID2."
"Graphics and physics are a significant improvement over the original GRID, including new race event modes that can be selected during the single-player campaign.  The downside to this game is that most races are only 1-lap so you either have to drive really good, or make extensive use of the flashback feature. Due to that the game starts to feel repetitive early on in gameplay. The other downside is the fact that you have to pay for additional vehicles despite the hefty cost of this game. The theme these days seems to be to make the game cheap or free to compensate for having to purchase so many additional vehicles."
"Huge dissapointment. I played it on the Free Weekend Weekend, and I'm glad I can review it for you. The animations and graphics are amazing, but the gameplay kills it. Your launched into the game with no real tutorial, and the steering is way too hard. Whenever I turn, I find myself being launched into the wall. 3/10 Huge dissapointment."
"Too hard to be relaxing, too simple to make sense to work on button-pushing skills."
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO all pop culture repherences 
Brilliant Grafics!
"Streets are slicker than oil on a sheet of ice. Feels more like controling a curling puck than a car, and the only way to make a corner is to slide around like a cartoon character. Hovercrafts have more traction than these vehicles. Maybe this sliding is a bit more controlable on a gamepad, but with a wheel it's nigh impossible, you just spin like a boomerange in flight.  It was also frustrating that the only way to exit the game is to Alt F4, or Ctl Alt Delete. I'm not joking. Acording to the forums, you have to beat the first two races in order to get the option to exit the game, I never made it that far.  The game is certainly pretty though, with great damage physics."
"I dont know why some people dont like it, I played it and had a lot of fun with it, nice game if you can get it on sale, mazbe not worth for full price, but then again, it isnt bad at all, wery good experience."
"Flashback is not available in real life.  8/10  nice substitute for dirt 3, which is not playable atm"
"Controls are horrid, physics are terrible, and thinks that going sideways is the fastest way to go around a corner"
Its a ♥♥♥♥ game graphics on the cars are good but the other particles are ♥♥♥♥ :/
Very happy
Not impressed. Not my type of racing game. To many American cars at the start which are very loose and tail happy.
"I would reccomend this, however i want more cars and not all dlc. otherwise I like it."
"The arcade racing is pretty weak, but the game is really beautiful"
"GRID 2 is a highly arcade racing game, you won't find any real simulations that obey laws of phisics here. Having this said, If you're into that cup of cha, you'll be delighted to play it.  + amazing graphics + interesting career mode + the feel of speed  - handling can be pretty awkward at times  8/10"
"I remember Grid 1 being a lot of fun. This on the other hand feels... very new age tween gamer.  Twiddling with the forced intro race, and trying to setup a Simraceway wheel (which was unmanagable), the entire grid finished the small circuit before I even started moving... and yet when I finished I received that annoying poitive reinforcement nonsense that is the reason why kids today are self entitled morons. Horribly late finish = OMG, that was amazing, all eyes were on you, that generated so much interest.  Forced, unskippable cutscenes = Check Decent though generic to Codemasters handling = Check (didn't feel engaging like Grid 1 did at the time)  And the visuals... lens flared street lamps during the day? That's just a cheap way out to add bells and whistles to an otherwise overglossed and unbalanced/unrefined art style.  All of those things are initial markers of what the game really is. Disposable and forgettable. I've played more than enough titles over the years to know that feeling of mediocrity at the start of a game that is just going to stay mediocre, at best.... and this is one of them."
"this game is terrible: -its hard to control the car, every car is like the roads are covered in ice.  -limited amounts of flashbacks -the menus, ugh -No music, come on.   pros: great graphics, but that's it."
"Really Good Game, Good Connection to online and so long, but they have to fix we can spectate another players online without the game closing or crashing. I got a big problem with this game and its when i play the game, my game just freeze sometimes and i have to pull out my USB Keyboard from my Computer and inside again to make the game run again. But it happends every 5-10mins... Plz fix that problem! :) Really good game, but fix the problems :P Thanks."
"GRID 2 has some very nice graphics, it can also be a lot of fun in multiplayer when you have some good players to go up against (alas, next to no online players in my region).  I do not see that it is an improvement on the original GRID, just different. Some features that made the original game great are missing or are not as good, however there are new aspects which make up for some of the losses.  Watch out for the computer players they are not subject to the same rules as players (at this time) for example in Touge when you the player overtake, you can be disqualified for touching the opponent, however you also get disqualified if the PC crashes into you when it is overtaking, a little unfair! To summarise, this is a good game with some nice graphics, it would be a great game if you could connect to more servers for multiplayer and if the game rules were better balanced."
a great game. a good arcade game. lacks everything enjoyable unlike the first title.   online mode is pointless unles you are only playing your mates. everyone else just ram's.
"3 *** As a racer I like it, really its a good game. I can't help but feel like they could have done more with it. Eh well still its good and I like it."
"I loved the first GRID which melded arcade and simulation racing perfectly. So I was a little put off by reviews saying GRID2 was a completely different game. I needn't have worried. While it’s true GRID2 is more arcade-like than the first it’s none the worse for it. It looks good, it feels fast and the point to point races are excellent. I’ve recently got into the online mode and that too is a lot of fun and a decent game in itself (level up, earn money and upgrade cars). My only criticism is that it doesn’t feel like there are quite enough tracks. I would have liked more variation (many tracks are just different routes round the same city). But it’s a solid game and definitely the best arcade racer I’ve played since the original GRID."
"Highly reccomend the game, just not any of the DLC. DLC not worth the cost."
"Amazing!!!! Best racing game out there!!  Get it and you won't regret it, even when your ♥♥♥♥ this game is fun xD "
"First let me start with the basics, the graphics look amazing. Secondly the driving is very fun but note that the handling is not as realistic as previous CM titles, it pulls more towards arcade than simulation and I personally enjoy it much more this way as you have more freedom with your cars. You stll have realistic chassis and engine damage that can make crashes fantastic to watch in replays but still best avoided at all costs when you're racing!!  Overall the driving is more arcade fun than simuation-like realism."
"It might not be a sim racer, but it's still a lot of fun, especially once you get to Europe and have some grippier cars to choose from. The tracks are great too, except for Yas Marina which has some problems with detecting you as cutting corners for no reason."
this ish is terrible. the options menu is TERRIBLE you cant change your settings at anytime when playing online.
"HATED the first one, tried this one because it was free for a weekend... Loved it!!! really great and a real improvement over the first one."
"If you have a basic understanding of how to drive a car this game is not for you. I acknowledge that it is an Arcade game and not a simulation. But never have I played a racing game that took itself so seriously as a simulation game, yet was so arcadey. Juiced 2 is more realistic than this game. I cannot possibly beleive that the developers of this game knew in anyway how to drive a car, much less race one. Grid 1 took itself a little more seriously and was a bit more realistic but in whole the series is very arcade-like. And Grid 2 is so unrealistic, and so arcade-like that it's nearly unplayable.  That being said, there is fun to be had if you're capable of forgetting how a car operates at a most basic level. The career is great, and it's set up very well and honestly, something I've been wanting out of a racing game. If only the gameplay could match the set up."
"Handling is too finicky, and there's no car type selection at start. Too technically challenging for my tastes."

great game kinda hard but you'll learn
the game is pretty cool but steam wont let me download any of the content packs even the free ones 47% recomended
Best racing simulation ever  Heres a few reasons: Awesome cars No lag at ALL.  Extremely cheap and awesome!
"Very fun arcade racing game with nice graphics, cool cars and fun race modes."
Best graphics so far :D Easy controls :D shift = brake space = accelerate a&amp;d = turn
This game was amazing.  100 billion / 10
No one online play at all !!!???  No session available at all time??? This Game Is Dead !!!
"If you're a Forza/GT (or any real racing sim) fan, this game is not for you.  If Need for Speed is your game, but you want something that tries just a bit harder, you might love this game.  Very arcade, terrible physics, gameplay is pretty straight-forward (as you'd expect most racing games to be) yet still feels lacking in some way. You can /feel/ how much this game wants to be a simulator, but it just can't get there.  that said, the environments are beautiful, the graphics are almost very well done. However, the cars look terribly plastic, hotwheels-esque.   If you're looking for an automotive enthusiast's game, keep looking. If you're looking for a fun arcade style racing game, still, keep looking."
Tried it on the free weekend. All was well untill after I finished the indie race. Then just a black screen while the game was playing in the background. Look in the forum and could see a lot of players with a similar issue and little in the way of help from CM. Shame as I really liked the original Grid which I had no problems with. Will go back to that I think. Anyone considering getting this I'm sure its a great game if it works. My advice to you is to try it first and possibly save yourself some money and grief. Disappointed in CM given their past successes.
One of the best racing games
"Best racer on PC I've played so far... A mix of Juiced, Forza, and Need for Speed. Feels real, yet slightly arcadey."
im glad that it was free for the weekend so i did not wastw my money on another codemasters crappy unoptimized games the driving is even WORST than watch dogs codemasters is posion aviod their games at all cost
9/10.. Great racing game with a nicely made career... Crashes very rarely. Love it.
tip top
* Pros ~ This game has great Graphics and Depth. 4K Capable.  The controls are easy to use with Joystick.  Career Mode pushes you to earn new Cars and Sponsors.  Good flow to the game in terms of immersivenes.   * Cons ~ Races tracks seem a little too short.   Cars Seem to have the same capaibilites and speeds.  Racing AI can be better.  * Found it a little too Arcady&gt; vehicles bounce into each other and off posts like rubber etc?  * No cabin driver view.  * External view subpar.  * The only con that would deter me from this game is its Acrade type gameplay.  Interpreted: This game is for a quick fix on the weekend at a party or with others that just have 1hour to shoot with the game.   * I would recomend this game for Ages 12 and under only.  * I expected a game for a Mature audience with Driving Realism. Which it does not provide.   Note: The game is fun on a Large screen with Surround ~ Very immersive and playable.
The developers are reallly great at optimization! This game runs extermly smooth AF! If this game ever crashed there has to be seriously something wrong cause this game LOOKS AMAZING and RUNS SMOOTH as hell! Great Job best PC Optimized game to this date!
best car graphics 10 out 10 ign game of the year
"GRID 2 is a pretty nice game for the first 3 of 5 seasons. After that, it gets very repetitive and boring.   Okay, maybe it just gets harder after that point, and I kept losing.   Rating: 6/10"
"I do not recommend this game :  Is a Rip-Off, whos kidding who. i was a kid too. I had to eat white sugar white bread and white milk from the farm !!  The ay eye Sir thank you may i have another reaaly stanks - the arificial sweetner knows onoly special-K and KPax.  There is no on-line mode that is any fun, any fun.  The h/w rquirements are way over the top AND not even on the Ceiling [for what you bang fro your get. . And if your a dyslexic kid you will loose your license. Go figure. etc. etc. etc. But Should have been a great game Should have been both a great sequel and Pre-Quel [ to Grid numbre one; numbre ONE! Should have been ..................................... . Would have been, and Never Not wAAs. :("
Nice Racing Game
"Very fun game. I love how you can't just mod your car to be better than everyone you're racing (see Forza, etc.). Every race is a challenge. The only problem with this is if you have trouble with a particular track, you can be stuck doing it over and over again for a very long time. Still, best racing game I've played in a long time. I kinda want to buy a wheel for my computer because of it."
"Definitely a let-down after the high standard the original GRID set. They made some neat features like tracks that change as you move through them, AI that doesn't rubberband back to you, and larger cities, but it was in vain since the game was not as fun. I think the original GRID was a little more arcady but it added some character. As I played GRID 2, I felt it was lacking something; I couldn't race how I wanted to.   Also, the story was overdone and a little too cheesy. In GRID 1, the player was a low ranking driver hired to compete against Ravenwood. Slowly, they got better until they were racing in global races as opposed to small local events. In GRID 2, you start out street racing, get 'recorded,' and then get 'famous' through internet videos and social media. To me, it was a bit of a stretch and I prefer the simpler, more generic racing story.  TL;DR: Overall, GRID 2 was fun but it did not live up to the original's standard. It didn't feel right and I thought it was too restrictive. Wait and see about Autosport."
.
But the handling of the vehicles is a bit to get used to.
"Very Great Game,i've played a lot while the game was free,and from what i see the game is awesome :D  the pleasure of doing amazing drifts,high speed (Fact),and playing online with your friends is an awesome experience.I Highly recommend this game.  I'm Brazilian :P"
one of my favorit racing games on steam. also has great eyefinity support.
One of the best driving games I've played in a very long time. I definitely recommend this game to any race game fan.
Great arcade game with fine keyboard controls. Better than it's predecessor with hilarious keyboard controls. Feels like On-Road Version of DiRT series.  아주 재밌는 게임이다. 전작의 그지같은 키보드컨트롤로 부터 탈출하였다. 최적화도 좋고 비교적 사양 낮은 컴퓨터로도 쉽게 상옵 혹은 풀옵이 가능한것이 특징.  
"Wonderfully fun game. Great with the G27, although the rev meter doesn't work on the wheel."
Nice arcade racer. i dont like codemasters career modes so much because you change car too often. I like to keep 1 car and make it good xD but ok career nonetheless =)
Plays very poorly. The car is so bad at turning that the game is umplayable. Don't pick up even if it's free
Too arcadey for me. Wasn't expecting it to be so incredibly cheesy. I don't think there is even an option to go to first person view.
"The driving is fun, but there are too many boring, un-skipable cut scenes."
this game is good as. once you get the hang of it youll never want to stop. get it while its cheap too
"Fantastic. GRID 2 is an amazing racing game. The graphics are excellent even by today's standards and the physics are a perfect mix of arcade and simulation, so this game acually works okay with the arrow keys. The career does seem a bit short, but it is well plotted and will keep you wanting to play. However, the AI's can sometimes be very rage inducing because they try and spin you out half the time. It is fairly easy to get back on track, until you get spun out again. You can rewind, but you only have 5 per race. The multiplayer functions smoothly, but you usually end up in some really high tier race. Overall, I recommend this game, it is completely worth the money. In fact, I would pay $35-$40 instead of $30 for the standard game."
Worst racing game I've ever played. I prefer realism when playing racing games. Makes me glad I didn't pay full price or even half price got it in Humble Jumbo Bundle 3. Paid $6.25 for the hole thing.
"Even after placing first in the qualifying races and being number 1 in tournament points, you still start towards the back of the pack just to force increased difficulty instead of making it a hard fought race, it just ends up being you weaving the bad drivers to catch up to the 'featured driver' who always starts frist on the grid. Not only is this frustrating(lowering the difficulty makes it much too easy) it distracts you from the game and takes you out of the world it so desperately tries to emerge you in."
"Was a little confused at the begining, had some problem setter up the controler. But then I totaly got stuck playing it, and i'm having alot of fun! I'd recommend getting it from the Humble Bundle if you have the chance to get it before it end."
"So far i played a little, but i recommend this game (so far, again). Nice cars, good maps and awesome graphics."
"There's too many loading screens and flashy transition screens, it takes forever to do anything. I got bored quickly because of this."
"Of all the games that I own, I can't run this even on Ultra Low. Check my games if you want, you'll see that the majority of them have better graphics than this game, and I run them on Ultra/High. This game is broken, do not buy."
"High Speed, action packed, intense gameplay!!! Extremely fun, the rewind feature is unique to the Grid series, I use it a lot haha...You will find a good bit of races, cars, and tracks in this game, but not much customization beyond your car livery. I still really enjyoed it, gameplay is top notch, graphics are pretty awesome on my laptop, and its not high end by any means. Shouts to CODEMASTERS keep making the good stuff"
"Grid 2 had me hooked from start to finish. You start out as a nobody in some random race and get noticed by a billionare due to your driving skills. You become the material to promote a new world series - WSR (World Series Racing). Your fame grows, you get contacted by sponsors who want you to take part in various events, you take on more difficult opponents all across the globe and eventually participate in the WSR Grand Finals over a set of races.  It's mad action from start to finish.  The graphics are fantastic and the car physics are exceptional. You notice a vast difference from driving a FWD car compared to a RWD or an AWD. Each car handles differently and you really need to be on your toes if you want to master it.  The game isn't without faults, however. The most prominent among them being the difficulty level. I consider myself a fairly competent player when it comes to racing games; I was playing on Medium from the start and almost the entire game through. Near the end I had to switch to Easy because the AI was just too fast. No matter what you did, they would always catch up. They would overtake you and then you were screwed.  Playing on Easy felt too easy and playing on Medium felt like Hard and sometimes Very Hard. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. I don't mind it being difficult, but it should also be fair. It reminds me a lot about the first Need for Speed: Underground game where in the last five races or so the 'Catch up' was horrendously broken. No matter how good you drove, the AI would always catch up and overtake you and you had no hope of beating them. Only by downgrading the engine in your car would everything work the way it should.  While this game portrays the cars and their handling exceptionally well, some cars are just way too finicky. Cars that are normally glued to the road when it comes to handling in real life are suddenly all over the place here. I don't expect a true representation but when other cars in this game are near identical as their real life counterparts, I do expect some kind of resemblance.  The tracks are well made but it's only a select few you race on near the end. Some variety would've been nice. That goes the same for the class of cars you're allowed to choose from. Somewhere in the middle of the game you have plenty of choices in what class and what type of car you want to drive, near the end it is only two classes and a select few cars. I would've liked a better selection.  I haven't tried online racing so I'm not going to touch on that aspect.  All in all, GRID 2 is a great game that offers plenty of action and challenge.  FInal Verdict: 7/10. It's a great game but the difficulty level is kind of messed up and lowers the score a bit."
I know there's alot of viewers out there that say this game isn't as good as the first but I have to disagree I found this game pretty awsume always been a big racing fan so ya anyone who reads this buy the game well worth it.
thats a 10
"I like the game ! Is it like the original or older games?....Yes, pretty much from what i remember &amp; it's been a while since i played grid 1 it seems to handle similarly......thing i don't like is the way you progress in this game. Also i hate this BS DLC thing games have these days.....it really feels like you are paying 2-3x for what you used to get. Game is still a blast &amp; would recommend to friends &amp; others But i don't know if it is as much fun as i have had in previous titles. I been around since the original TOCA back in the mid 90's but i do see some 'references' like the muffler swaying like in race driver 1&gt;&gt;&gt;lol......kinda funny to me. since i think offline is dead for grid 1, this may be what u want, games are fairly good....Unlike cheaters in NFS games. i'd rate it like close to 8/10. It still has a good feel to it &amp; looks great. it's NOT a true sim game but it's damn good for what it is &amp; better then just being arcady...........each to their own :)"
Cars can feel abit slidy but once you get used to that it's a great game
"sadly to much dlcs , gameplay is good,  no one plays this, makes fun  if i happen to find s1 hosting it's a dlc"
very nice graphics. real time controls. lots of diversity in game.
I Love it.
"Grid 2 is an amazing racing game half arcadey half sim, unlike the first game you won't manage money, but fans in order to unlock more events in the world.  This time around Patrick Callaghan recruits you in order to establish a new grand championship of world racing series, and he needs you in order to beat different clubs around the world in order to convince them to join the WRS championship, you start in america then europe and japan, finalizing with global events with the fastest cars around.  After each race or championship you gain fans, every certain amount of fans you'll get a nice little video about how popular you're becoming in internet forums , tv and etc. After each season of the WRS you'll also get introduced a eSports real life video talking about the events as well.  The graphics of the game are amazing and run pretty well optimized, maxed graphics 80+ fps on r9 280, altho during loading screens i experience a bit of lag.  They introduced new kind of events in addition of modifying a few event rules of the previous game, for example instead of time penalized in togue for making contact, you'll lose the round , or in race circuits in those racing flashy circuits if you cut corners you'll drop to 50kmph speed for a few seconds accordingly , they added eliminator events, every 20 seconds last place gets kicked out, checkpoint event get through checkpoints as fast as you can before your time runs out , time attack fastest lap wins , drag races (only dlc sadly) , overtake traffic and endurance X amount of minutes promo events for racking up fans."
Grid 2 still has the thrilling feeling of the first with top notch mecahnics that keep you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this over the new GRID;Auotsport game!
Great game!
One of the best racing games ive played. Altho i wouldnt mind to be able to customize the cars a bit more !
"The company was lazy. Do not buy. If you have to try it, get it on a humblebundle or winter sale. I think it was a rip off. Why? Lazy devs/directors. No cockpit view? Lazy.  Each kind of car handling roughly the same in a class? Lazy. A silva and a mach 1 do not handle nearly the same. Cars having only a few sound clips? Lazy. Re using backgrounds from previous games? Lazy.  GTF outta here codemasters. You're as bad a ubisoft and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ uplay."
"Good Graphics,many different cars and fun when your able to perform a perfect drift"
"Very fun game! Especially if you are playing with your friends and not only driving to win, but also destroy eachother and have fun!"
A solid racing game.
"these guys both suck AND blow!! seriously the vast majority isnt sitting with a steering wheel and pedals like the clowns at codemasters; and no one CALLS their self a master, OTHERS call you a master lol! save your money. i know there are plenty of FREE driving games."
"I had a brief experience with Grid 2  This negative review I want to preface is for the attention of people not regular to the racing genre whom may want to get a rare fix and are thinking of this game to get that done  Don't.  There's better out there for our kind  So the asshat narrator is useless for a start - 'catch your back end', 'balance your speed' that's all he's got for me - how about tell me what button combinations to press at which speeds  This was after the first warning flag had reared its ugly head though, the first achievement pops and it’s titled “Here’s my number, Call me maybe?”   I don’t have any problems with that scene, it’s not mine, there’s a good chance that if the racing genre isn’t part of your regular sensibilities then a game that makes those kinds of references may just annoy you too  Finally I am having a mess around the test track and I decide I’m done for my first session (at this point fairly sure I’ll at least play it one more time) when the game throws me into an unskippable cutscene like somehow their video of their schmuck stock racing character is so good that it demands my time with no option of me bypassing it  It was at this point that I decided Grid 2 is a game that is not meant for me, which means there’s a chance that it might be a game that's not meant for you either"
"Grid 2. Genre: Racing, Simulation, Arcade  Pros: -Physics -low system requirement -Ability to rewind -challenging  Cons: -Drifting is not really satisfying -Small car customization (you can only change the rims and add vinyls to your car)  Summary; This is a great racing-sim game, its not really hard for beginner. eventhough there's some drawback this game is recommended to everyone who likes racing-sim games with some arcade aspect  8,5/10"
"This game looks quite gorgeous. The graphics have had a real step up, there's some really good paint options available, reflections look amazing. This would be a great game as long as all you ever do is look at it.  As soon as you start to actually play it, that is where the game begins to fall apart. The key to GRID 2 is simple: Drift. The first tier of cars you obtain in career mode, every single car in season one - even with DLC - is a Drift car. And there's a reason for this. Once you finally do work your way up the ladder, you do tart unlocking other cars. But even with other control schemes, 'balance', 'grip', there is only one way to take corners with any speed: Drifting.  And even this wouldn't be as bad if it had the same more realistic drifting controls as the previous game. But this game doesn't. Not by a long shot. While it may be better than the infamously bad Ridge Racer series, Codemasters has decided to throw away all pretense of a 'racing simulator' and give us crappy arcade drifting physics. Every car will under-steer unless you hit the breaks to throw the back end out. Every. Single. Car. Every track is made for drifting around sharp bends. Every race expect you to drift if you want any sort of reasonable time. Simply put, if you aren't drifting, you aren't winning.  On top of that, the career tournament, sponsor, money/reputation system of the previous game is gone. Replaced with a 'social media' story, complete with ESPN interludes (who've proven they will do anything for a pay check whether it has any sense of reality or not). You win races to earn 'fans' (reputation). Cars are just given to you, you choose between usually two - which are either virtually identical in stats or one will be a clear advantage - and you can unlock the other in a time trial. The goal of the game is to impress drivers from other racing circuits to join your racing circuit by beating them in races. Let me put that another way: The goal is to impress enough fans that your brand new, all-styles racing circuit is totally for realsies by attracting drivers that you, personally, have bested in their own circuits, on their own tracks, against their own specialties. And now you want to race them off type, off class, and against each other to give credibility for your fantasy league. Yea, this is so much better than just, you know, trying to earn trophies from existing events.  On top of that, the AI has taken a huge step back from the previous game. Whereas in previous game, drivers had skill sets, they had favorite types, and - most importantly - they made mistakes, here we are back to AI that was laughable twenty years ago. They follow their racing line. They drive a little slower if they're out front, so that you can catch up, and a little faster if they're behind you (rubber band AI). They don't care if they hit a wall, they don't care if you're in the way, they don't care if you try to spin them. They will stick to their racing line and that is it.  But wait, there's more. In their infinite wisdom, Codemasters has added a few new race types, and of course removed some old favorites. One of the new events, Live Routes, is a race track that is dynamically altered as you race. In other words, you have to picture that there are people who, once a few cars go buy, run out and reset the direction of the track. Constantly. In a game filled with unrealistic, idiotic choices, this one takes the cake.  Edit: There is also the dreaded, obsolete, should not be seen in any video game post 2000 checkpoint racing. This was a mechanic invented for arcade machines back when you had to continually put quarters in them every 90 seconds in order for them to earn money. You have a time limit, and each checkpoint adds a little bit to it - not enough to get to the next point on its own, so that you will eventually run out. It has absolutely no place in home games. This mechanic needs to die. Even though it is used here slightly differently than in the old arcade games, here it's set up as an actual competetion - which is probably the best use you can make out of it - checkpoint racing has left such a dirty taste in my mouth from so many games that I just cannot respect any racing game that includes it anymore. This isn't the only thing either. Elimination, the way they have the '5 second rule' to Togue. This game has completely forgone 'simulation' for 'arcade'. While some players may like that, having race styles that can only really be done IN a video game... After the first GRID game, this is not at all what I wanted to see in the sequel. I have no problem if that's the game that they wanted to make... but it should not be titled GRID 2.  There are better racing games out there. If you haven't already played the first GRID, go give that one a shot. The cars there feel good, the game looks good, the races make sense, the AI is competitive, and most importantly, that game is far more FUN. But hey, at least you can have pearlescent paint if you buy this one instead - though you can never remove your sponsors."
"When purchasing grid 2, I had expected a serious racing game, like how grid 1 had the sponsoring, lemans, and all the official racing events, and when I walked into grid 2, all I got was an arcade-like drift racer. I'm very dissatisfied with the game, nor can I get a refund because I spent an hour and a half trying to get it to run on my computer, then another hour trying to find the more serious events. I recommend only for someone looking for a drift racing game. It's excellent in that regard, but not for a simulation game."
"If you liked Grid: race driver, its's like that but harder. I think."
doesnt work with controller
The difficulty curve on this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
Very good complex race game.

"This is a great game, But if you like the Realism of Need for Speed Shift, Shift2 Unleashed etc, This game might disappoint you.  However, Playing online and the style of the game is fun to play.  The Car sounds are by far the most realistic i've ever hear in a game - Compared to all racing games i have played"
One of the best driving games I have played. I am not a big fan of racing sims but this is by far one of the best.
"Worth the play, not the money. Wait for a sale"
It's a lot of fun but it wont be easy!
"Hey, would be a nice game except it crashes every 15 minutes without fail. No solutions available online. Oh, and since some of the events are multi-race you've got almost no chance to proceed through the game. So pretty bloody annoying really."
buy first one instead ... -2 / 10
Great graphics. Great Cars. Arcade driving. One of best racers out there
"Can't make it workd with Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 wheel. All other games (Race 07, F1 2012) work, but I cannot control my car - crash on every turn, can't even go in a straight line without crashing. Can't change wheel settings to respond -- the slightest turn of the wheel sends me crashing. Any help?"
"Love this game, sometimes get raged at sakura pass. add cockpit view, it'll be awesome! 9/10"
"Awesome game.. If you like cars and challenges, buy this game!   WrAp3r,"
Game is dead no body players it spend 1 hour waiting for someone to play with
Just like the 1st part is Grid 2 an amazing race game wich you definitely buy when you're a big race game fan!
A Great Game! It Moves fast. Found one issue in grid 1 it tells you when to brake but in grid 2 does not.
"i was really suprised tho :3 .... i can say , this game worth's every penny ! :)"
Fun game more people online would be good :)
"Played the crap out of this game on PS3! To me, Grid and Grid 2 are 10x's better than any of the Need For Speed Title. They just bring so much content to racing thats different and how it's delivered is what keeps me coming back for more. I highly recommend Grid and Grid 2. The racing is fun with just the right challenge. Grid Autosport doesn't know if it wants to be an arcade racing or racing simulator. Just stick with 1 and 2."
"The game is really fun to play, very good graphics and all but the damn screen flickering is really annoying, to the point where it actually affects the race."
"If you're thinking about buying this game after playing Grid 1, forget it! This game is the worst nightmare for those who are fans of Grid 1. When you play it, seems like it's incomplete, the feeeling of being a real driver, competing for money and sponsors has just been lost, your car never turns without drifting and it gets worst when you realize that you just earn cars and more just winning events. It's almost a whole new game, nothing compared to the first game.  My tip is: Stay playing Grid 1 or buy another racing game."
ars dont handle good like in grid or Toca race driver 3 they have the cars driving like ♥♥♥♥ do not buy this game they need to fix it like Toca race driver 3 where u can pick slim or pro slim driving. Hell i can go around coners faster in my Chevrolet Silverado 3500 Duramax 6.6Ldual one ton and i am a real car car driver too so i know what i am talking about 
"GRID 1 was better (gameplay, online, drift!) GRID 2 has better graph, somme good tracks (touge), the online is empty, no one plays it..."
awsome game when i played it :) shame the weekend was so short :D nice driving not to hard but still not to easy :) right on the go
"Don't bother yourself with a steering wheel, I'm so dissappointed that after 20 hours of racing I have discovered - playing with a keyboard is just easier. The way how cars are acting in Grid 2 is sad, unrealistic, irritating, hard to manage with steering wheel... Ghh, sure, graphics are beautiful, there's plenty of cars, and I had many moments of pure fun. But still, I hate Grid 2 somehow."
"10/10 Would Race again, but seriously it's a nice racing game."
Not the racing game I was looking for
This is a ♥♥♥♥ of a game especially online mode...Dont buy this game.. Grid 1 was fantastic game but this is vrap!!
only two words to sum up this game PURE GENIUS ENUFF SAID
* Pros ~ This game has great Graphics and Depth. 4K Capable.  The controls are easy to use with Joystick.  Career Mode pushes you to earn new Cars and Sponsors.  Good flow to the game in terms of immersivenes.   * Cons ~ Races tracks seem a little too short.   Cars Seem to have the same capaibilites and speeds.  Racing AI can be better.  * Found it a little too Arcady&gt; vehicles bounce into each other and off posts like rubber etc?  * No cabin driver view.  * External view subpar.  * The only con that would deter me from this game is its Acrade type gameplay.  Interpreted: This game is for a quick fix on the weekend at a party or with others that just have 1hour to shoot with the game.   * I would recomend this game for Ages 12 and under only.  * I expected a game for a Mature audience with Driving Realism. Which it does not provide.   Note: The game is fun on a Large screen with Surround ~ Very immersive and playable.

"My controller stopped working right when I got this game, so my race experience was worse than buttered sandpaper. By the way, I got eigth place on the tutorial level, and that was the tutorial... This game kind of expects you to have a controller. If you come across this game, move off the grid (see what I did there) into Southern Antarctica."
"If not my favorite, at LEAST my 2nd favorite and most time spent playing racing game ever (so far). Great visuals, fun gameplay - just where I like it: not too arcade-like, not too simulation-like. I personally love the game a ton. Really really happy I got it, maybe worth looking into for you too."
"GRID 1 was better (gameplay, online, drift!) GRID 2 has better graph, somme good tracks (touge), the online is empty, no one plays it..."
awsome game when i played it :) shame the weekend was so short :D nice driving not to hard but still not to easy :) right on the go
"-Unbalanced AI -Generally poor car control/driving  Despite blowing away the competition on every single race event, there was one single race event where I literally couldn't catch the first place car whom drove so far away from the rest of the competition it was ridiculous. This happened again doing the WSR where there was a car I absolutely could not catch in the second event so I quit and chose a new car hoping it had the speed. It didn't.  I then spent every single corner spinning in circles because this car was so unbelievably undrivable. Easily the most undrivable car I've ever driven in a racing game. While I had thought that the driving had improved for the most part in GRID 2 over the first game, I had just been in generally decent cars. Then, to be able to pick the original car I had to ACTIVELY forfeit the first race in the series, go on to the second race and forfeit that one as well instead of just being able to quit to the menu. For anybody who's curious, you're better off using ALT+F4 to force-quit the game and then choose not to continue the event when you restart it.  In my case, after I was forced to alt+f4 to quit, I just proceeded to uninstall the game while I was at it."
Great racing game visuals still hold up well easy to find cheap
"Codemasters, how you have fallen from great heights. Grid 1 was great, it struck the perfect balance between between babby's arcade racer and a super sim like their F1 series. It was accessible to all but was difficult to be good at and it was actually a real feeling of accomplishment to win a race on the hardest difficulties.  You dropped the ball with Grid 2. You took a great series and watered it down into homogenized irrelevancy. That perfect balance between sim and arcade is now weighted heavily as an arcade racer. As a longtime fan of Grid 1, putting probably 100 hours collectively into the PC and Xbox 360 versions, I am insulted.Well lets start with why its bad, shall we?   Every car handles like it has weights in the trunk. You could drift any car by just tapping on the brakes lightly, regardless of what the car is. I can drift an old comaro just the same as a Nissan Silvia. Every car handles the same. You licensed all these cars so you can make them all handle badly or sell them off as DLC.  The whole experience just seems to have bumped its head a few times. Sleek, easy to navigate menus are replaced by ugly menus that try too hard to look like a youtube page. On these menus there is unoriginal 'taunts' by your rivals that are more annoying than intimidating. After each event, your team leader will make some stupid comment and you will be forced to watch a cutscene with licensed ESPN logos and real ♥♥♥♥ing ESPN commentators. Yes, they spent the majority of their budget on unskippable ESPN branding.  In the first Grid, there were many disciplines spanning over three regions. Across the US, EU, and JP regions there was some diversity. Each region had its own identity and unique experiences. In the second grid, every place feels the same and every discipline feels the same. Demolition derby was added as an afterthought.  I really did give this game a try. I wanted to stick it out and believe it was good. I couldn't make it past 8 hours though. In that 8 hours, I drove samey cars around samey tracks in unmemorable disciplines. When is the fun going to kick in? When is this game going to give itself a reason to carry the Grid name? "
"Grid 2 is one of my favorite racers.  It gives a great challenge, but its still very fun and easy to pick up and get good/ok at. It also looks very good, graphically!  Recommend"
Another great Codies racer.
All i need is a Logitech G27 then im all ready to play this again. But ill give it a 9/10 without wheel!
just ok. Wanna be simulator without the crazyness of arcade
"GRID was way better. This game has amazing graphics, but otherwise, just the same thing with not as fun features as GRID Otherwise, it's still fun, but since it doesn't live up to GRID, i can't like it as much. 7/10"
"This is an amazingly fun and addicting game, however, it has some major issues that need to be addressed, particularly with it just being able to simply run. I've found that after about 30 minutes of straight play, it starts crashing and rebooting every other race. In the middle of the freaking race. It's ridiculous. I can be almost through with the entire race, then the sound goes out and it totally crashes before automatically rebooting itself. And it obviously doesn't save any data from the race. So if nothing else, that's what would be holding be back from recommending this game. If a fix comes out for it, then I'll be sure to edit the review.  Overall: 4/10 Fun, but has some major problems."
good one and the best is splitscreen mode !! worth it
"This game would rival Horizon or Forza if one could reverse. Even using a PS3 controller, remapping the controlls, using some strange fix from the site - if another car flips you around because you're in first - retire. You CAN NOT finish this game."
Played alittle of the first GRID and it wasnt bad. Got this game during a sale and i love it.
"Sadly, game crashes on loading screen. Barely could play and tried everything. People with new system and windows 10 should aware of that."
"Not recommend it,if you are a hardcore racing gamer who enjoy racing sim before such as pcars,asseto,gran turismo,i racing,raceroom and etc,grid 1 is good as a arcade racer,but this grid 2 is rubbish as a arcade and for its racing experience.  CONS: nobody play online,the multiplayer is dead in this game,  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ driving physics,where your car will spin like a tornado even if you just make a small contact with wall or opponent cars,  drift? wtf is drift in this game?nope no drift mechanism for you,go slide and spin off your car and pretend that you are a drift master instead!!  car performance stats system are so stupid with the bar,every car have almost the same stats  AI is too easy to win in normal,too hard to win in very hard,in very hard AI is driving like they are in a train rail,passing through every corner like they stick a super gum to the ground  no cockpit view   PROS: other then that its a ok game for its well optimize lag free graphics even on low end pc it runs pretty well on medium to high setting  single mode is ok  car sound was ok  so thats it if you are a racing gamer who enjoy sim before,you better not get it not worth the price but if its on sale you can give it a try,or you can just get grid 1 or grid autosport which is better than grid 2,grid 2 driving physics is one of the worst i had experienced."
crashes every 15 minutes i cant complete a race please fix
"Good game and all but why is there so much ice? it makes cornering with keyboard and mouse impossible as there is no actual trigger on a keyboard which allows you to gently slow down, instead on this game it just instantly slams on brakes and spins you out. not even had the game an hour yet and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. also the AI, its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. literally, they can smash through a 2 ton Ford Mach 1 in a 1.5 ton Nissan Silvia no matter where they hit me, also if i even so much as tap one, or think about tapping one, i smash up and then theres the events. the event which has you filter through the pickups with flashing lights, well i tried filtering when it said 'They're evenly spaced so that you can filter through', im sorry but having all of them bumper to bumper and smashing into each other smashing my car up and the other racer and having me only win because my car was only just able to move at 2 mph with -12,800 points while the other racer which was AI had -700,000 points and no wheels which resulted in me lapping him while being pushed sideways around the track with no wheels as the pickups were pushing me, is kind of a ♥♥♥♥ take. no way is this game realistic enough to be played for a long time. im giving up already after playing about 15 min... will try and get into it again in the morning, but as of right now its almost 4am, i need my sleep."
Racing is impossible the roads are covered in ice that cannot be seen even using flashback the first race was impossible!
+gameplay +graphic +friendly menu +great audio +good price (sale 6.99eur) +real brands +realist game -limited cars
"GRID 2 Review I have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out.  Single Player Campaign GRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into 'seasons,' with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.  Online Multiplayer The GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.  Replay Factor One of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.  Controls and Graphics GRID 2 supports a wheel &amp; pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.  Value I purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this 'North Pole Noir' sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.  Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.  Aspect Rating Physics 10 Plot 10 Damage 9 Multiplayer 10 Community 10 Graphics 10+ Value 8 Overall 9.5  Final Points on the Game Not only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games. If you love racing games, you will love this!  Be sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did! Also, I have a few screenshots from this game posted! Thanks for reading!

"If you like racing, buy it!"
10/10 Would hit tree at 90 mph again.
Nice game
this games controls are like gran turismo turned up to level 7 sensivity and when you think youve mastered the controls you suddenly reilised youve just crashed into a rock overall i think this game should have handling like forza or need for speed but it doesnt so its terrible
can i get a refund. this game has only crashed for me
nothing like grid   nothing like grid autosport   but a good game on its own if you have not played grid before   a game that is in itself separated by new ideas so not so good some good   so if you own grid right now this is a negative review   but if you have not played grid before you will mostly like this game and its a positive  if you fancy this game youtube gameplay before buying it    added 13/3/16   after playing it for a while and delearning how grid 1 plays the game is feeling better .. online is ok but lacking the personal attachment too players you get in other games  but with practice this game does hold up as a good game .. assuming your not expecting a grid replacement .. this it is still not ..
GOOD: -graphics BAD: -awful cutscenes -not able to enter older events -no money mechanic -DLCs 7/10 Great for anybody that likes cars and video games
load of fun
"A really nice upgrade form GRID to this GRID 2. Best graphics, cars, sounds and not to mention the ambient of the game so beautiful. Love it. But, I am too late for the online GRID 2 because already moved to the latest one? Btw good game farewell!"
"Boy am I glad I did not buy this game when it was first released, I bought it today and only paid around $7.50 for the damn thing and as far as I am concerned I wish I had not even spent this amount on it. I am new to racing games and this one was a very poor choice for me even at the 7 dollars spent for it. The reason? There are no tutorials or practice sections in the game. When you first start the game you are put right in a race, no time to even figure out how to drive the damn car etc. It is probably ok for an experienced gamer who has played a lot of these race games but stay away if you are new to race games. Even though I paid for this I am going to uninstall the local content so it does not take up storage space, I only wish there was a way to permanently remove the game entry in my game library and if I thought I stood a chance of getting a refund I wold ask for one."
"Decent game, has a great amount of depth to it. The cars handle really well. The online is still really active which is pretty rare for an old game and there is tons of DLC available for it."
The feel of control is terrible
"It is pretty good actually, i would say it is worth it."
So much bad UX! Bad menu! You can't switch cars in online mode only under some mysterious conditions.
"GRID 2 is a racing game where your car is made to drift every corner, does that appeal to you? Then play it, for me it completely killed the game, it was a huge disappointment after the first GRID, which was a great arcade game. I wasn't expecting any great simulator for what its worth, but please, don't make me drift at every corner, simple as that. This game had a lot of potential but the terrible gameplay is not worth it, just play GRID Autosport instead which is a FAAAAR better game."
Best racing game !
"I don't really rate this game compared to the first game of the GRID series. The handling felt wrong since you have to powerslide around every corner, and the career mode of the first game was much more interesting than the social-media stuff in Grid 2. In general I just didn't like how all the cars in this game felt, which is pretty important in a racing game.  Some of the cars and circuits are locked behind a DLC paywall, so if you enjoy Grid 2 be prepared to pay more money to have access to everything in the game."
Gave myself the nickname 'Bird'. ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful.
Want to drive on ice with a top of the line sports car? Play this game.  Would play 10/10
omg nice game this grid 3
A Great Game! It Moves fast. Found one issue in grid 1 it tells you when to brake but in grid 2 does not.
top notch
"Can't make it workd with Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 wheel. All other games (Race 07, F1 2012) work, but I cannot control my car - crash on every turn, can't even go in a straight line without crashing. Can't change wheel settings to respond -- the slightest turn of the wheel sends me crashing. Any help?"
"Love this game, sometimes get raged at sakura pass. add cockpit view, it'll be awesome! 9/10"
"Awesome game.. If you like cars and challenges, buy this game!   WrAp3r,"
"Been playing for about 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes) when writing this, and I'm loving it! I was hoping for a game that you started off with a bad car and upgraded it over time, and that you get fans so quickly and easily, not really realistic. Still love driving as a whole in this game and drifting! :) I recommend it if you like racing games (obviously!)"
Amazing Game! It's got great graphics and amazing veichles.
Good game to use with the Logitech G27 racing wheel. Can get boring after a while.  It also includes multiplayer but no one plays it anymore.
Nice simcade but if your looking for a real good time get Grid 1.
"The number of pros in the game outweighs the cons. The severity however is another story. The way I see it, there is a huge flaw with the handling. It is unreliable and unpredictable, often failing you when you need precision. It is too responsive and sensitive and makes timetrials and powerlaps a pain. Regular races are fine as the AI on normal and below are dumbed down way too much. Driving in this game is like flying a jet fighter, You'll do fine at high speeds but when you try to move around at low speeds or need to stop, the whole thing shakes apart."
This game is just awesome but its hard to play with the logitech G27
Game is dead no body players it spend 1 hour waiting for someone to play with
"Don't buy if you have Windows 10, it crashes randomly for almost everyone and they aren't going to fix it. Check the forums."
"Really fun game, especially if you have a wheel."
"Great game, soo many cars with great graphics! Never is boring."
"No. Just no. I can't believe I preordered this game, after having so much fun with the first Grid. Here are a couple of reasons:   - Some cars have a really nice handle, but for the most part, they either have terrible under steer or over steer.  - You are made of sticks, glued together with those cheap sticks of glue you can buy at corner stores. Everything is out there to kill you. Tapping the curve will cause you to do 360 no scopes, and enemies will cause you to phase out of existance upon impact.  - Following the above, visual damage is way too exaggerated. Your car will fall apart, very very quickly. If you have vehicle damage active as well, good luck trying to maintain a healthy car. You will most likely lose a noticable amount of your steering halfway through the race.  - I played through the majority of the game on Hard difficulty, with full vehicle damage until season 6 without realising. I changed it to Normal difficulty. No difference.  - If you and the AI both spin out because your car over steers like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the AI will most likely take no vehicle damage, and will carry on, treating you like fly.   That being said, I will continue to play this game simply because I'm close to completing it, but please, if you want to spend your game on a racing game, pick the first one. By far one of my favourite racing games of all time is the first Grid."
Had a bunch of fun playing this game until I stopped having fun playing it.
Best arcade racing game ever!
Very nice graphics and gameplay! 10/10
The game itself is not bad...but I expected something different.Unfortunately it's a regress comparing to the first GRID.
"Easy to play and fun as I am a fan of racing games. Got this in Humble Bundle, very good value."
you must buy this game
"GRID 2 is a fun racing game. That's all there is to it. If you're looking for *incredible* graphics/narration/customization in 2016/beyond, go elsewhere... But if you have an itch for a race or five, drop the $30 and keep coming back for more.  I wish it were a bit more realistic, but for a 2013 release it's solid.  3.5/5"
You can play this on an ultralow voltage Intel chips like the Haswell core-i5 4200u.
Enjoyable Racing Game! :) :) :) [9/10]
Best game ever! Love it! Everyone has an equal chance to win.
"Grid 2. Genre: Racing, Simulation, Arcade  Pros: -Physics -low system requirement -Ability to rewind -challenging  Cons: -Drifting is not really satisfying -Small car customization (you can only change the rims and add vinyls to your car)  Summary; This is a great racing-sim game, its not really hard for beginner. eventhough there's some drawback this game is recommended to everyone who likes racing-sim games with some arcade aspect  8,5/10"
"Corner cutting detected!  This game has a lot of potential. I was drawn to the Grid games because they were challenging. You could ramp up the difficulty to a setting that makes the races fun but still has you trying to outbrake into corners or trying to get the best line to drive onto the straight.  The previous 'Grid' had it's issues but was a fun game. It often felt like the other cars were attached to you by rubber band and that you couldn't get too far ahead without them hitting ludicrous speed to catch up. It's main problem was that you never knew where you were going to start on the grid. You could be in the 5th round of a race, having won every other round, but still end up starting in some random, mid pack position.  That same random start issue happens again in this. It feels like they have got the physics right, the cars handle well and you get the feeling that the opposition aren't 'on rails' as much as some other ghames. If you ram them, they'll move but you will take on damage as well. The car models look great and the smoke, crowds, general background are very smooth and really help you to get into the game. The replay function is a lot better than in the previous version. Graphoics art, in general, beautiful with some great reflections going on.  There are a couple of small issues that you can get past with some work. The main computer character/bot: Carter is way better than all of the other racers. It's almost like they don't matter.  My main issue with this game is the dreaded 'corner cutting detected' which kicks in if you leave the track on one of the 'proper' circuits. The game penalises you by slowing you down to sub-30mph for a few seconds while you are on the track, as if your car is fitted with some sort of tracker that can physically slow you down.  It happens when you cut a corner but It happens when you get pushed out wide by other cars. It happens when you drive a little wide to avoid a pile up. It can even happen when you spin out.  It's not every race, It's not even every track, but it is immensely frustrating when it does happen and it sucks all of the fun out ouf this game for me.  2 hours into it and i'm considering uninstalling it because of this issue.  A shame really. Like I said, a lot of potential.  Grid: Racedriver gave me around 30+ hours of solid racing. I was hoping this would be even better. It looks like I have to find another racing game to sink my time into."
Phenomenal graphics and a fun game. Very challenging too.
I love this game. It is so mush fun
"I bought Grid 2 on HumbleBundle for $1 along with some other Codemasters titles. But, I'm just playing this one and it rocks. Nice balance of arcade-simulation, gorgeous graphics on my 3year old laptop. This might as well be my best ever Steam buy!!!"
doesnt work with controller
"Hey, would be a nice game except it crashes every 15 minutes without fail. No solutions available online. Oh, and since some of the events are multi-race you've got almost no chance to proceed through the game. So pretty bloody annoying really."
Amazing graphic considering its age. only one bad thing about it. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ CANT I DIRVE FROM INSIDE IF I CAN IN GRIDE ONE WHY!!!!! WHY!!!! WHY!!! WHY!! WHY!
made me kill my whole family  10/10 IGN
no it run for ten fifteen mins and crashes but windows say its playable
"I always liked Grid, The first Grid, The seccond that i'm reviewing now, And Autosport, Keep with the good work Codemasters"
"*shrug*  I played it for a bit. I'm not usually one to take chances on racing games, but I picked it up as part of a bundle thought I'd give it a go. Played with a controller, maybe it would have been better with a wheelthing?  At any rate, the cars just don't feel fun to drive. The controls felt kind of loose, and generally sluggish, maybe it gets less bad as you unlock other cars?"
"Not as good as grid 1, the drifting is crap compared to grid1,"
4/10
-bought game -thought driving would be easy -crashed 2 seconds in -tried again -tried 10 more times -uninstalled  10/10
Trying to use my Logitech G29 racing wheel with this game. Turning it on in the settings breaks my menu. Keeps scrolling up and can't change it back. I'm done with this game already.
"If you played the earlier TOCA (or DTM racing driver in certain countries) games and/or the first Grid installment you'll feel right at home. In all honesty not all that much has changed over the years. Obviously the graphics are better, the diversity and racing series went from true to life to invented, and there's a bit more of a twist to how races are done.  Graphicswise, it's good, it looks good without taxing your system too much and it's nice to see real life locations in detail although some liberties are in place to ensure a racing environment.  Diversity, well it feels like Grid really, again 3 continents with their own typical genres and locations, it's nice to see a multitude of brands in game though, it does add flavour.  Twists in races like the 'no map, ever changing' or the 'checkpoints without a real finish' are nice additions to racing games in general.  So what's not so good?  Well as in most of these arcade racers the storyline is cheesy at best and the productplacement from ESPN feels dated very fast for non-USA players. Another negative point is that it really feels like the first Grid but with better graphics and new locations, it fails to feel enough different to really live a life on its own.  Another bad point is the length of gameplay, it definitely is a shorter game than the original GRID, as after 18 hours I'm already done, which is, a bit underwhelming if you bought this at full price (I haven't, but I would feel that way)   As conclusion I'd say that if you enjoy these type of games, you'll enjoy Grid 2. If you're looking for something new and exciting or for a simulation, then you won't. If you compare it to Grid or the earlier Toca's, there's a lot left to be desired. Too short, no storyline, no feeling with your AI adversaries, online racing is a crashfest, no it doesn't warrant full price, but for 5 euro's you could pick up."
"Enough of ♥♥♥♥ talk. This Game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible! The worst driver experience I've ever had in my life.   Your car touches a fly: sry pal but race is finished for you. 2 meters to the finhis line at 200km/h a car not only overtakes you like if you were going at 20km/h but it also throws you of the road, you hit a tree and die. srly, don't buy."
"Short:       Gameplay   6       Story   4       Graphics   8       Sound   6       Replay Value   4        My Score    5      Grid 2 (stylised as GRID 2 and known as Race Driver: Grid 2 in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters  and is the sequel to 2008's Race Driver: Grid. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 28 May 2013 in North America,  30 May 2013 in Australia, 31 May 2013 in Europe and 25 July 2013 in Japan.   The game includes numerous real world locations and cities such as Paris. It also includes motor vehicles spanning four decades.  In addition, it includes a new handling system that developer Codemasters has dubbed 'TrueFeel', which aims to hit a sweet spot between  realism and accessibility.  This Racing game gave me a nice experience, and the True Feel handling system is good.  I don't know actually where should i start, it has a little storyline, the graphics is simple and nice, and the HUD is clear.  The cars are nice, the sound of the engine perfect, i only missing the good music, sometimes we get a little adrenaline pumping music but that's it. Tuning is nice, not much but nearly enough, as for me i didn't like the camera when you checking the car at tuning. I'm missing the Engine tuning part too. Usually when the car crahsing its nice and good, but sometimes it's just slury rucky...  The physics are bad in the game, the crashes are nice but u got a little slow motion video cut when you crash and that's it.  There are 60 ahcievements but you can get 50 with the original game, you have to buy DLC to get +10.... So you can get nearly 83% ahcievement without DLC's.   Once the opponent is retired that was funny so i just had to drive.   A Question why did i smashed my new McLAREN MP4-12C car on the Californian track? :( The answer is that, a squarriel was running trough on the road... :D  I think the game at the end a little bit annoying with that much point system. Uhm i mean a lot... for everything if u go to the bathroom that count points...  The game good. Totally worth!   Pros: -Nice cars, car details.  -Rubber smoke perfect.  -Rims  -Manual shifting (so awsome, do not start with automatic shift! :) )  -Crash system (Mostly good)  -So many race types.  -The view of speed or speeding.   -Exhaust flame.   Cons: -Tuning Camera  -No engine tuning / setup (just in online mode)  -Physics"
"Played the crap out of this game on PS3! To me, Grid and Grid 2 are 10x's better than any of the Need For Speed Title. They just bring so much content to racing thats different and how it's delivered is what keeps me coming back for more. I highly recommend Grid and Grid 2. The racing is fun with just the right challenge. Grid Autosport doesn't know if it wants to be an arcade racing or racing simulator. Just stick with 1 and 2."
"not that good, but playable  trying to play online is a joke, getting kicked from every lobby for no reason driving the car at 200kmph on a non flat surface alongside AI car and my car goes crazy, but the AI car is perfectly fine the controls are terrible - almost every god damn car drifts at the slightest button press - or maybe my keyboard is ♥♥♥♥ (and for all those who say 'it's a racing game get a wheel or controller' i say get the ♥♥♥♥ out)"
"Way too hard and unpredictable physics, even in easy mode."
game seems ok alot more arcady than grid one but still enjoyable  but i refunded it due to it crashing alot and being stuck in windowed mode
'I don't need that' (when a part of my vehicle falls off) 3/10
"Drift past other drivers, watch them scream and rage as their car falls further and further behind :P"
Fun game more people online would be good :)
"i was really suprised tho :3 .... i can say , this game worth's every penny ! :)"
"Awesome, more cars, more tracks, more fun"
"6,5/10 If you are looking for racing game then there are better choices than GRID 2. If you want to be rear ended/side rammed etc while doing your best Ken Block impressions then this game will be your favourite. Overall it's pretty decent game, but only if bought from humble bundle or on sale. And controls can randomly stop working, just cause ... reasons ?"
"Graphics? it's above Dirt 3 but not by much... in places I spotted god aweful textures (for example if you lose the bonnet the engine texture is like gameboy grade stuff... WTF?) but most of the other stuff is about what you would expect from a last gen console port, PC looks glorious but could be vastly improved with some HD texture updates... 1gb GPU ram useage is not exactly top end textures when you factor 16x AA is being used on mine with Ultra settings which would be expected to be best served by GPU's running 2+gb RAM these days... 1gb stuff should be low-midrange gpus only.  Handling? well the cars are once again quite arcadey in the feedback, but the controls are very tight and very responsive indeed...more so with some car perks added. Overall its a good job all round there.  Sounds? Nothing to shout about... bland music, okay sound fx, meaty engine fx on the muscle cars, plus a few random crowds shout out stuff as you whizz past.  Multiplayer and Single player? Multiplayer has the most to boast about here, all the unlock systems for perks and paint jobs all require cash from winning races, in solo campaign it's merely handed ona plate for little effort, not to mention there is no perks for solo mode either, so assume cars fully modded as default.  Overall? well I have to say is most positives... the multiplayer is fantastic as always, but some thing spoilt it for me... such as day zero DLC bullcrap, and no cockpit view. "
Good game with serious bugs. Keeps jumping out of the game into windows mid race at random.
That ♥♥♥♥ing game keeps restarting randomly. So annoying !
"Wicked game! awesome graphics and great realistic car handling, not totaly SIM, but not like NFS underground lol"

Best game ever! Love it! Everyone has an equal chance to win.
Do not buy this game. Can't get it to run and I appear to not be the only one. Game will not get past the launcher no matter how many of the so called fixes I have tried to do.
"I don't even want to get past the first hour of this crappy Drift Simulator. The driving for me isn't fun, entertaining, or realistic...You just Drift 80% of every race and half the time it ends up in a crash. Regardless of how good your car is or how much skill you have at driving it always ends up feeling the same."
"Just terrible, everything about this game is annoying.  want to paint your car? well you only get to see the extreme up close front of it and have to wait a good 5 seconds for 'view vehicle' to load in.  No vehicle part upgrades all about social media fame and fan numbers to unlock next races...skill not required arcade style steering and control obnoxious voice acting   2/10 would rather play sonic racing"
Not a big fan of driving game but get boring very quickly.
another code masters game with lack of steering wheel support.  I don't buy car racing games to play with my keyboard you know.   I uninstalled after this review. What a disapointment.
"This is a really good, solid racing game. GRID 2 is fast-pased, speedy and exiting driving experience. I never imagine that passing someone would be so much fun! The driving is thrilling and racing makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The graphics are a big plus too, beautiful landscapes and lens flares look really astonishing. Unlike getting more exp you get more fans, which is pretty unique and fun thing to have. The whole athmosphere of the game is so uplifting and, in a sertain way, relaxing that it had to be mentioned. If there would be any bad thing to say about this, it would defintelty be the difficulty of this game. This is a quite hard racing game even in a most easiest settings, especially for those with no racing game experience.  Other than that, GRID 2 is easily above average racing game, with fantastic graphics and athmosphere.  3/5 The scenery was so beautifull that i accidentaly drove of the cliff"
"I played grid 2 as a free acess for 3 days and I absolutley loved it. AUESOME cars, tracks, and graphics. However the crash physics can be a bit unbelivable. The frame bends in ways that look catoonish. Also, there's no way to kill your car. So you can have absolutley destroyed your car cosmetically, but your car will still be able to drive. Also, I played this game hoping to get a simulator, Instead I got a game with NFS type physics. I don't know If they were shooting for an accurate driving simulation game, but that is what the trailers made me think. I sadley have a crap computer but the game still runs at a smooth 30FPS. I have not found any good or bad glitches In the game. Despite the arcade driving physics, and cartoonish crash physics, I HIGHLY recommend this game. I rate this game a 8.5 out of 10"
"Good singleplayer and bad multiplayer, a lot of bugs."
7/10
"So contrary to the negative reviews, I love this game. I picked up this game just yesterday on sale and it's the best 7 bucks I have ever spent. I see a lot of people saying that this game is all about drifting, and it isn't. Yes it's a big pat but you can easily make those turns by simply hitting the break and slowing down and make the turn and keep up with the competition.   I love this game because to me it is more arcade like in terms of steering the car. The graphics are amazing. I only have GTX 760 and I can play the game on Ultra. The car selection and customazation is not the greatest but enough to satisfy. Overall this is probably the best 7 bucks I spent on steam."
"We have only had this game for a few days, but it keeps us playing it to get to the next round. At times there is screen problem, even with a 144 hz setup. The game can be fun once you get used to the controls and start winning the races on Very Easy. It's a nice game to kill time with and it's not overly complicated. Graphics are beautifully done, but sometimes they break up during the race. Courses do provide a welcome break from a circular race track."
"The graphics are better than Grid1 but the gameplay is pretty similar while driving but with less choice in what sort of races you do. Grid gives a alrge choice in the events to do next, grid 2 makes the choice very limited.  Also it keep crashing for me. I win a 3 stage event then the game crashes on the results page. After restarting you are classed as DNF on the event and have to do the whole thing again.  Buy grid 1 instead. The graphics are not quite as good but it's cheaper, is a great game and it doesn't crash all the time and cause frustration."
"This game s poor you can change paint job but you cant ♥♥♥♥ing tune a car what the hell the ai drives on roads more easy than the player if they bump you,you can spin out of control or crash man f i see anyone that made this game we Throwing Hands!!!!"
Grid 2 is a positive step up from grid improving on graphics and racing physics! awesome game!
this games controls are like gran turismo turned up to level 7 sensivity and when you think youve mastered the controls you suddenly reilised youve just crashed into a rock overall i think this game should have handling like forza or need for speed but it doesnt so its terrible
can i get a refund. this game has only crashed for me
"Fun to play with friends, best DLC's to get, Demo Derby, and the Indy car pack. Its fun as hell to play splitscreen with friends on weekend nights fueled by coke and pizza. Physics are realistic, great feadback with G27, fun with xbox360 controller. 10/10 Will always play"
"Its a decent game, not very complicated but interwsting"
Try to fix if you press ALT + TAB and switch window then your game will go into windowed mode :( but then i still recommend it
"You can´t push other cars hard, but they can easily push you and make you crash af."
"GRID, you went all Burnout and DLC on us. Why the ♥♥♥♥ did you go Burnout and DLC on us? You basically took GRID 1 and all it stood for, and spat on it. At least you made things a little better with GRID Autosport. I hope you've learnt your lesson."
"Bought on special but a waste since it keeps crashing. This and Grid Autosport. I'm not the only one, here's a post on the CM forums with lots having the same problem...  http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/18547/grid-autosport-crash-after-10-15-minutes-in-game "
Quite bad compared to other GRID games
"Great fun, best racing game so far."
Multiplayer Gameplay Demo:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666604636  Enjoy.  --
Full toxic on
Racing is impossible the roads are covered in ice that cannot be seen even using flashback the first race was impossible!
"Very fun game, esepecially for those who loves racing. This game got great graphics/ physics. Its stand out point compare to the Autosport is its ability to drift, unlike autosport you can hardly drift"
"Many people criticize this game for what they wanted it to be, rather then what the game trys to be. This game is arcady drifty slidy physics. Which aren't bad, I enjoy flinging cars around corners sometimes. GRID 2's physics are RELIABLE, if you start drifting and know how to control it, you can do very well. You have to learn the foreign physics model before you can truely do well.  Personally, I like GRID Autosport more since it is a bit more simulatory (?) but I still enjoy a GOOD arcade racer, which GRID 2 delivers."
nothing like grid   nothing like grid autosport   but a good game on its own if you have not played grid before   a game that is in itself separated by new ideas so not so good some good   so if you own grid right now this is a negative review   but if you have not played grid before you will mostly like this game and its a positive  if you fancy this game youtube gameplay before buying it    added 13/3/16   after playing it for a while and delearning how grid 1 plays the game is feeling better .. online is ok but lacking the personal attachment too players you get in other games  but with practice this game does hold up as a good game .. assuming your not expecting a grid replacement .. this it is still not ..
"Last year’s Dirt Showdown never really knew what it was. Grid 2 does. Its continued shift away from its sim pedigree will still disappoint those of us who fondly recall the Race Driver games of old, but it still a great, modern package. A well-curated car list, a great sense of speed, and a well-thought out career mode combine in a racer that is a lot of fun to play through."
"First of all, this developer has succeed to manage the storyline, making a racing game more intense with it. Truly beautiful work. Graphic quality isn't bad for a 2013's released game, and the engine sounds is pretty impressive. Hearing how the tires squeaking in the race really forming a race atmosphere. But compared to Dirt series, (which is well known as rally games and the tires rarely to meet asphalt road) Grid 2 really has an oversteering issue, I don't think my skill is questionable in here. I have playing many many of racing games, but this one, I don't know, it just feel weird for me racing above the asphalt road and found my car oversteering excessively. It's like driving over muddy streets, and makes me wondering 'a well made car like Koenigsegg Agera has this bad quality of traction?' to this point, your realistic racing simulation are really questionable, Codemaster. The last thing what I hate the most is, where the hell is the cockpit perspective? Do u really think you can feel a Pro atmosphere in a racing circuit without a cockpit perspective? That's a shame. I say NO for this one, only for this one."
Good visuals [+1] Good car mechanics [+1] Good gameplay [+1] FUN 10/10
"Wheels turned right, vehicle still moving forward, crashed wall. Can’t drive again."
this game is really good but god the physics are not up to standard. It seems like the tyres on the car has no grip and every car always slides in a basic turn which means i loose my confidence and i dont perform to my best.
one of the most best car game I've ever played. I recommend this game to everyone who like cars
if you have friends to lay with it is awesome but i would like to see the game where the dont slide out in every corner
"Even if it is more on the arcade side, it is a great game with a good variety of cars, tracks and game modes. Online community is still active(in comparison with Grid 1). I almost have 100 hours in the game and i am still playing it from time to time. Pros: ++ content variety; +good multiplayer infrastructure( if you have a group of friends you can have a lot of fun);  Cons: -- Car handling ( drifting physics may be a bit annoying); - Damage mechanics simplified from Grid 1.   If you are a petrolhead and want to drive s2000's and nsx 's casually, this is a great game."
great game if you want a very challenging racing game. Not a game for beginners. With that aside I like this game because it has really good graphics and sound as well cars though wish the boards were more realistic to their reall world counterparts as well wish more cars and settings like say I mention Forza Motorsport but great game none the less for a racing game on a computer and Steam.
Awesome game! I love everything!!
hit a piece of grass and my car broke down
"Grid 2... there's some fun to be had with this game, some... but 90% of the time it's frustration that you will get. You want to finish 1st? then be prepared to restart a race HEAPS of times! Your car scrapes the side, you lose. Your car makes contact with anothe car, you lose. You start to drift where you're not supposed to, you lose. Only buy this game if you have the patience to slug it out and repeat a race a whole lot of times, and when the price is dirt cheap. :)"
"GRID series are like Dragon Age series of racing games.  GRID was made by company that is famous for amazing racing games (TOCA, CMR) since late 90s. Dragon Age was made by company that is famous for amazing RPG games (BG, KOTOR) since late 90s.  Both GRID and Dragon Age are pretty much considered as successors of previous games made by these companies.  And, well... both GRID 2 and Dragon Age 2 aren't worthy of being part of their franchises. Would they be received better if they weren't using these famous names? Most definitely. Neither of them is straight up bad, it's just that neither is up to the ultimate benchmark that first games in the series set years before.  The parallel doesn't end there. In both scenarios developers of each game tried to redeem themselves with third title that oddly doesn't have the number in the title. And both of them kinda succeeded. Neither Autosport or Inquisition is considered to be as good as original game, but it's still miles better than first sequel.  There's one important difference though. With Dragon Age it's good to know the story of second game before playing third one, so it still is slightly recommended to play through it anyways. GRID series aren't story based games, so there's my verdict - avoid this if you liked original TOCA series and first GRID. Go buy Autosport instead... it might have some issues, but it's still miles better than this.  I can only recommend this game to people who aren't really into franchise as a whole. If you like Burnout or Need For Speed, but you're tired of chasing with police, over the top crashing and racing on highways... then and only then this might be the game for you.  Probably the biggest disappointment Codemasters ever delivered, and that's counting in feature-poor F1 2015 or Colin McRae Rally port from mobile phones to PC (nobody really expected anything from that, right?). Thanksfully it seems like they are on the right path again with Dirt Rally and F1 2016. Here's hoping that another GRID game will deliver as well."
"Okay, the game is enjoyable if you love drifting and stuff. But like everyone says, the streets seem to be covered with ice. Another thing - no 'first person' which i loved in first GRID And - the thing that makes this review a negative - HALF THE CARS ARE DLC! Come on."
So much bad UX! Bad menu! You can't switch cars in online mode only under some mysterious conditions.
"Ok, lets start with the physics, this is actually like the worst physics in a racing game that i have played and i mean it. Drifting is very nice and smooth but in normal races, the drift events feel really really weird and its annoying to drift there or maybe its just me. The graphics are just great ! This game is from 2013 and in my opinion you could still compare the graphics to a new game (if you are playing with everything on MAX!) Overall this game is really fun to play only if the physics and AI was much better it would be a fantastic game ! Right now i would rate this game 7,5/10 and i really recommend everyone to atleast try this game---- THX for taking your time and reading my review."
"  i would reccomend this game to all my buddies, if you want a little bit of more of a challenge download dirt rally."
"I don't really rate this game compared to the first game of the GRID series. The handling felt wrong since you have to powerslide around every corner, and the career mode of the first game was much more interesting than the social-media stuff in Grid 2. In general I just didn't like how all the cars in this game felt, which is pretty important in a racing game.  Some of the cars and circuits are locked behind a DLC paywall, so if you enjoy Grid 2 be prepared to pay more money to have access to everything in the game."
"IMHO, the GRID is the best arcade racing series on PC. The NFS can't touch it since 2008. GRID 2 is an excellent game. The arcade driving physics is very enjoyable... well, apart of drifting."
"Terrific keyboard mechanics and gameplay. However, not so good for wheel setup! A great game to play competitively against your friends until all of them leave because you were to good. ( fcck u david, Alan, Anthony, Alex, Sanji, Ralph, luke, and Jeff) you're all faggoots for tag teaming against me in races :( # i still won tho, drifted around you all :^)    # 137 consecutive wins against david in 1 v 1, tilt harder lmao"
The best racing game !
"in every collision, i get thrown around and the other one drives on undisdturbed.  10/10 would race cheating AI again"
NIce game
"one of the worst 'simulation' car games i have played for long time sensivity, not possible to adjust, as settings doesnt take any effect ] sterring wheel ] oponents are unbreakable, but they can smash and drive trough you no problem strongly not recommended for anyone, i want my money back"
Great game but be careful of those tough drivers they will put you in the wall given half a chance.
"Pros: Funny arcade racing game, very good graphic, many cars and nice tracks Cons: No practice mode for online cars, Game can't find lobby where race is starting (you have always wait for ppl to finish the race cause you go to lobby in the middle of it), ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people who can't take first corner But overally game gives much fun :D"
Welcome and Enjoy!
"Pro: -Great graphics on all settings, heavily optimized -Arcade-like driving so it's very fun -Lots of rims to choose, applicable to every car -Fun game modes like, Overtake, Eliminator and Checkpoint  Cons: -Besides some class 4 race cars and the Indy cars, every car drifts in corners unless you go slowly -Drifting a corner is faster then normal driving -No driving options like, TC, ABS and so on... -No cockpit view, both chase camera close and far shake when speeding, hurts your eyes after a while -Although damage is realistic on the visual side, it's imperfect on the performance side. You can hit a wall and either bounce of to continue driving or destroy your car. Only Demolition cars can have their tires blown -Only the Online mode has performance tuning, with the car changing into a higher class gets a body kit lift. No options for having body kits in Singleplayer mode -Even if ingame music is off, there is still music played on example: final laps, last two drivers, 30 seconds left, and so on -Demolition races have a bug, both Online and Offline, where your position will be changed from any place on the board to last, because the game thinks you cutted the track. No evidence to confirm why it happens, most of them happen if a player is first and made a big gap between others behind him -The game is 3 years old, and already gathering cheaters. In one session of Online playing i encounter at least 1 or 2 players that are driving two times faster or don't get a penalty for cutting corners -Drift races are not fun offline. In order to enjoy them, you need to get the Drift Pack DLC -Replay camera is awfull, made to look like a movie or commercial. So some great momments during a race can't be seen from the track side replay angle. You can view only your car in replay  Conclusion: Fun game, worth playing. You can get frustrated Online easily. Not for the Racedriver Grid 2008 hardcore fans."
Very nice game 
"Cheaters! Speed boost and extra grip - two most common. And the only way to get rid of them is to report steam profile. Codemasters don't give a f**k about this problem. As for Valve I dunno if they ever issued a VAC ban for this game. It's a real shame because the game runs smoothly and it's enjoyable. I have no DLC and frankly I don't care. These RaceNet challenges don't pay too much eighter and it's like a single player extension really. I would give it solid 8/10, but because of cheaters it gets 5/10."
"First off, this game has decent graphics, and is very easy to run. Gameplay wise it's just like any other racing game and not much differentiates it from other games, the physics, customisation and overall immersion are all quite good, nothing quite stands out about it but I would still recommend the game to anyone who's a fan of racing games in general. 8/10"
"I like the graphics and the way the car gets beat up. physics are really good too. it'sgood for a game that was made in 2012.  i guess i would recommend it but i didn't play it for long before i got bored. i like car racing games, but this one isn't really my type. i guess maybe im not good enough? lol it's worth a try though"
light game with xtremely nice graphic
Good visuals [+1] Good car mechanics [+1] Good gameplay [+1] FUN 10/10
less fun than the first one. It s just a correct driving game. i dont recommand this game at full price
i want more car list.
This game is worth that money 
Just buy it
It's cool
great game but dead multiplayer
"i loved grid , grid2 : the driving is boring, crap sensations, no more Le Mans , no more supercars. All interesting things from grid are no more there. Should have think more before buying this ♥♥♥♥."
"This is one of the best ARCADE racing games I have ever played in my life like NFS underground. The physics are better than NFS games. Online &amp; Career modes are really enough. If you want an ARCADE racing game, this is the best. If you are looking for a real racing simulation game just get F1 series such as F1 2013. Thanks to codemasters for building these games!  MAC OS X NOTE: If you buy GRID 2 Reloaded version you could face a problem during game such as 'damaged downloadable content'. The solution is easy. Close your steam application. Clean caches in your SAFARI via develop menu in SAFARI. After then, open steam and right click to GRID 2. Click properties and open local file tab. Click verify cache. Finally, restart your computer and it's done!  Have Fun!"
This is a massive waste of money the company who created this game have commited daylight robbery I personally this game has not been optimised for any control system and the physics in this game is seemingly non-existent due to the massive neglection of friction as the vehicle you drive initially has less grip than a weightless car driving on a polished metal surface with gripless wheels. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF: -You don't want to waste your money -You don't want to give a money grabbing company (who are possibly worse than EA) money -Have at least one functioning brain cell
"  i would reccomend this game to all my buddies, if you want a little bit of more of a challenge download dirt rally."
Didnt work! what is the problem? Cant start the game.
"WOW! So far this game has been amaxing with all the dlc added. It is awesome with all these awesome cars with my favourite, the koegnigsegg. DEIFNITELY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Great racing game, arcade style with plenty of cars and nice challenges. Good graphics and nice race tracks."
Maybe its just me.. But I kind of liked Grid 1 beta for some reason
"GRID 2 feels awfully patronizing. It's full of talky people who drone on and on about your next event. Hey, Mr. Sponsor guy, or whoever you are? I get it. It's a racing game. I need to race the other people and get first place. Codemasters (the developers) tries to space all of the talky bits out so that you're doing things in between some dingus blabbing in your earpiece, but then, Codemasters also included a tutorial that feels the need to break down the very concept of a race, as if you were going to play this game having never understood what the goal of racing was. I was halfway expecting to get a tutorial on what an accelerator is supposed to do, to be honest.   If you can get past all of that waste of breath, this is your standard Codemasters racing game: beautiful visuals, not-quite-simulation-but-good-enough driving physics, and some pretty dang intense racing with great damage modeling. As of writing this review, I've only played it for a little under an hour, but I can already tell exactly what kind of game this is, because I've played three others just like it, and I am definitely in for this one.   If only everyone in the single player mode would stop trying to chat my ear off about this 'World Series of Racing' nonsense. Stop talking about driving and just let me drive!"
game says its running but it never actually runs. i've redownloaded everything and still nothing. the game was good when it came out but not its crap
worst drifting system ever  i don't know what they're intended to
"This looks nice, but only one thing I am not like it. That was the game only had few vehicles, most player enjoy more vehicles more than 30+ right? It is only thing I was disappointed."
"The graphics are great, the sound is fantastic, the driving physics are very nice, and it's easy to play even with keyboard controls. Buy this game for the single-player or playing rounds with your friends, *not* multiplayer with random people. You will find that there are not always people playing online, and if you pop into a session, then you may wait for the current race to finish just to be kicked from the lobby once the host returns to the lobby, and if you do manage to get into a race and then do well in it, you may get kicked at the end of a race. That just happened to me twice: I won but I guess the lobby host was angry so I got a message saying I was kicked from lobby, did not even receive any EXP or Cash -- the grinding is slow in multiplayer, which makes this even more frustrating. The first time, it was in a lobby doing 5-race demolition derby mode, 10 laps per race, and so I'd spent something like half an hour, so when the thing ended and I had won, I was very annoyed that I had just spent so much time just to receive nothing because the lobby host was acting like a small child. The second time, I played against 2 people who both had much better cars (they were higher level) and since they kept crashing and going off-track I got past them, but when one caught up to me because his car was faster he tried several times to ram me off of the track. I don't mind that, it's part of the game. Anyway, he failed miserably and I still won, but unfortunately it seems Codemasters has given the power to lobby hosts to kick players mid-race. Clearly, that's easy to abuse, and although it would be great if they'd patch the game to at least give EXP/Cash when you're kicked, I seriously doubt that will ever happen because this game has been around for a while already."
"I used to play TOCA Race Driver 2 as a kid (even though it was just a demo it was my childhood game), this sequel still feels similar. I don't know how it compares to the other games named GRID, but I like this one. It has plenty of cars, decent visual customization, a sometimes tedious career but after all very satisfying. It also has splitscreen!!! A thing I miss in most games. Multiplayer is cool as well, although progression is really slow if you're not playing full house. DLCs are fair but it kinda sucks that you can't buy cars seperately. Whatever.  This game is really good, but see if you can run the demo first. You're gonna need a decent soundcard, but you will not be disappointed."
"Okay, the game is enjoyable if you love drifting and stuff. But like everyone says, the streets seem to be covered with ice. Another thing - no 'first person' which i loved in first GRID And - the thing that makes this review a negative - HALF THE CARS ARE DLC! Come on."
"The game is nice, but 115 bucks of DLC? Most of the cars are locked behind a paywall. GO ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELF CODEMASTERS."

"GRID 2 is a racing game where your car is made to drift every corner, does that appeal to you? Then play it, for me it completely killed the game, it was a huge disappointment after the first GRID, which was a great arcade game. I wasn't expecting any great simulator for what its worth, but please, don't make me drift at every corner, simple as that. This game had a lot of potential but the terrible gameplay is not worth it, just play GRID Autosport instead which is a FAAAAR better game."
"Dont let the brazilians ♥♥♥♥ you, and this is a pretty fun game."
its a perfect game
"Kind of fun racing game with a lot of drifting, but my enjoyment is severely killed with how disgustinly obnoxious the AI cars are even on easy difficulty. When they just simply graze my car, I get sent flying to africa, and if I were going full speed into them, they'll stay in the same spot as if they were a VGA cable with screws And they're always on 300 in speed"
Best racing game !
"The pros: - Great game for you if you like racing games with no open world. - It's easy to control. My 5yo learned fast and loved it. I bought for him. - It has a flashback feature which feels totally like cheating but well... it's in the game so... - Graphics are awesome.  The cons: - Price is high for what it delivers. - No car mods. - The base game gets you so few cars. They removed like 90% of the cars of the main game and put them on DLCs for sale. - Won't let you skip cutscenes. I hate games who do that. The impression is that the game thinks its cutscenes are SO AMAZING that you should see them. Not only cutscenes but you also can't skip little transitions in the game, which is annoying. - On windows 7, alt tab will mess up video resolution and sometimes not even get input anymore, only after restarting the game. - No real 'first person' view with handle bar and everything. Also no handbrake controls, you'll have to drift with your regular brakes. Also no mirrors, but you do see a little arrow when cars are close to you."
"Great racing game, arcade style with plenty of cars and nice challenges. Good graphics and nice race tracks."
Maybe its just me.. But I kind of liked Grid 1 beta for some reason
"For starters, I'm not really sure if I really like this game or if it's starting to get really annoying.  As someone who really liked the first GRID, GRID 2 starts off nicely. The somewhat familiar handling and feel to the cars is there, the atmosphere is nice and especially the tracks feel nice. The UI is straightforward and easy to use, but maybe a bit on the slow side when it comes to the garage and customizing liveries for your car.  So far, I'm having fun. I'm getting a good feel with the cars and handling, I get to know most of the tracks and all seems fun and games. But once you start progressing in the game, the infamous bots start to get annoying really fast. The back of the pack brakes really, really early into corners, cuts you off intentionally from overtaking and you literally have to sit there and watch as the top 3 bots get further and further away. You literally have to plow your way into the top 3, no bumbers spared, at which point the leading cars have gotten way too far away to catch up. So you restart. Over and over and over again until the AI screws up and you get a run where you get to the head of the pack early and have a decent chance.  That's when I started to realize that there really hasn't been any feel of being the better driver in this game. Sure, your cornering improves over time and you get to know the tracks but most of the time youre just fighting the same AI that literally feels scripted with the head of the pack always pulling really far ahead and the rest of the bots are there just to ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥.  There is, however, some difference to the types of race youre attending. Regular races and time trials give you the most pain with bots, elimination and face-offs feel decent enough and enduraces are ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty.   Still, on my first playthrough few years back after GRID 2 was released, I remember having tons of fun and maybe I'll get that feeling again once I finish the game a second time. I heard online-play is decent but with quirks of its own but I haven't tried it for myself.  TL,DR; Recommended but with reservations, decent arcade racing to enjoy on your own or with friends. Steam Controller recommended.     Race Restarters' GRID   "
"GRID 2 manages to inject a nice dose of realistic physics within an arcade style racing game. The result is a game that simulator purists will surely frown upon.... (lack of view, no tuning) but everyone else will enjoy. The locations and cars look absolutely stunning. The single player is meaty and the multiplayer is absolutely worth playing"
Pretty good for a half simulation come arcade themed game
"Good simulator game but in half this is also the arcade racing game, but after some time in this game I got bored a little bit."
"The graphics are great, the sound is fantastic, the driving physics are very nice, and it's easy to play even with keyboard controls. Buy this game for the single-player or playing rounds with your friends, *not* multiplayer with random people.

The second time, I played against 2 people who both had much better cars (they were higher level) and since they kept crashing and going off-track I got past them, but when one caught up to me because his car was faster he tried several times to ram me off of the track. I don't mind that, it's part of the game. Anyway, he failed miserably and I still won, but unfortunately it seems Codemasters has given the power to lobby hosts to kick players mid-race. Clearly, that's easy to abuse, and although it would be great if they'd patch the game to at least give EXP/Cash when you're kicked, I seriously doubt that will ever happen because this game has been around for a while already."
game says its running but it never actually runs. i've redownloaded everything and still nothing. the game was good when it came out but not its crap
"Kind of fun racing game with a lot of drifting, but my enjoyment is severely killed with how disgustinly obnoxious the AI cars are even on easy difficulty. When they just simply graze my car, I get sent flying to africa, and if I were going full speed into them, they'll stay in the same spot as if they were a VGA cable with screws And they're always on 300 in speed"
"Ok, lets start with the physics, this is actually like the worst physics in a racing game that i have played and i mean it. Drifting is very nice and smooth but in normal races, the drift events feel really really weird and its annoying to drift there or maybe its just me. The graphics are just great ! This game is from 2013 and in my opinion you could still compare the graphics to a new game (if you are playing with everything on MAX!) Overall this game is really fun to play only if the physics and AI was much better it would be a fantastic game ! Right now i would rate this game 7,5/10 and i really recommend everyone to atleast try this game---- THX for taking your time and reading my review."
"Good simulator game but in half this is also the arcade racing game, but after some time in this game I got bored a little bit."
"GRID 2 is a racing game where your car is made to drift every corner, does that appeal to you? Then play it, for me it completely killed the game, it was a huge disappointment after the first GRID, which was a great arcade game. I wasn't expecting any great simulator for what its worth, but please, don't make me drift at every corner, simple as that. This game had a lot of potential but the terrible gameplay is not worth it, just play GRID Autosport instead which is a FAAAAR better game."
So much bad UX! Bad menu! You can't switch cars in online mode only under some mysterious conditions.
Pretty good for a half simulation come arcade themed game
"The pros: - Great game for you if you like racing games with no open world. - It's easy to control. My 5yo learned fast and loved it. I bought for him. - It has a flashback feature which feels totally like cheating but well... it's in the game so... - Graphics are awesome.  The cons: - Price is high for what it delivers. - No car mods. - The base game gets you so few cars. They removed like 90% of the cars of the main game and put them on DLCs for sale. - Won't let you skip cutscenes. I hate games who do that. The impression is that the game thinks its cutscenes are SO AMAZING that you should see them. Not only cutscenes but you also can't skip little transitions in the game, which is annoying. - On windows 7, alt tab will mess up video resolution and sometimes not even get input anymore, only after restarting the game. - No real 'first person' view with handle bar and everything. Also no handbrake controls, you'll have to drift with your regular brakes. Also no mirrors, but you do see a little arrow when cars are close to you."
Best racing game !
The best racing game I've ever played
"  It's a really solid racing game, and has really nice graphics. They work on all types of graphics cards. Works across platforms."
"Here's a sequel to Race Driver Grid. With all glee the developers said, 'Be fast and be first, We'll give you a thirst.' That's not what the developers did!"
The online community is non existent. Ive been waiting in a lobby for 3 hours and no one has showed up. Do not get this game if you are looking for multiplayer. This should be changed to a single player genre. I only got this game for the online racing which unfourtunately does not exist.
you must buy this game
"Easy to play and fun as I am a fan of racing games. Got this in Humble Bundle, very good value."
The game itself is not bad...but I expected something different.Unfortunately it's a regress comparing to the first GRID.
Codemasters knows how to make racing games. F1 and grid proves this. I like grid because this game is not arcadeish. And it has many cars . Not that much but it has a lot .
"A fine racing game, ok graphics, good handling with steering wheel and so on. What to type? Buy it if you want a fine racing game!"
Best arcade racing game ever!
NFS hype but still good ;D
"Really Nice and stuff  Not like simulation but more like a mix of arcade, since drifting is OP and cool if you pull it off"
A great game!
"good game, most valuable game bought for now"
"Grid 2 is a marvless Car simulation of a higly detdicated car Racing and requirments of excellence in Driving Skills. The game it self includes car damage and its a game worth the money since the game got cheaper and discounted. The game it self is highly recommanded for mature players to see if you still got the driving excellence of good reflexes. Winning a race to at least get a trophy and end up on a podium. Its the Best Grid game made ever, good to take your skills in this digitised computer world and gain some improvments in it. All diffrent Cars Engines and horse power a full on Racing challenge with highly adbvanced computer oponents and also on line.  "
Great Graphics and enjoyed the gameplay and the multiplayer!
"good arcade driving game, no in car view but not much of a problem. good with a wheel or controller. graphics look good. the game is good fun to play."
"if you are playing on win 10, please note that you have to turn off the Touchpad and Handwritting..... in service, unless you game will crash in 10 -15 mins."
Best of best :D
"Pretty cool if you like driving games, well worth a blast"
It's a mix between Arcade and Sim racing with a nice damage system and great car selection.
I did this for the badge.
"After a few hours (~50-60 hours) I think could write a review for this products too: I Love It and hate it. Multiplayer easily can ♥♥♥♥ off [there are soooo many wreckers].  //After 1220 hours: sadly nothing's changed - german cheaters, wreckers and anti-fair players... //But --- SOMETIMES! --- we have a good times with good &amp; fair players in the lobby. That's why I stayed in this community yet."
"On the whole there is much to recommend this game, but I think it is not in any way a racing game for the novice or hobby racing aficianado. Tracks are beautiful, the sound is fantastic, race modes are surprisingly diverse and engaging, course layout is well-balanced and challenging, but there are a few significant shortcomings that easily-frustrated racers will struggle with. AI is atrocious and will run you over in the pursuit of their racing line, any collision with AI vehicles will remove all steering capacity from your car until you disengage (meaning you will have to brake as the AI won't do so to disentangle itself), and the game's inexplicable career decision to constantly shift you between disciplines and vehicle classes will rapidly grow weary. It is almost impossible to develop any kind of racing groove when you are boomeranged between track toys, drift cars, and heavy upper class vehicles that steer like couches. And then the shuddering camera - evidently set that way to give the sensation of car vibration and sway - will give you fits if you suffer from any kind of motion sickness. In the chase view, and especially racing at night, the sway becomes infuriating and actively impedes developing skill and consistency. The handling can be an issue, too, but with practice you will get a solid handle on how cars respond to steering inputs, and indeed the (unalterable) steering sensitivity comes to make sense with time.   In the end, the game is excellent, but is perhaps not suitable (re: fun) for gamers not familiar with its quirks and oft-puzzling handling/viewing designs. The difficulty slider can only help with the competitiveness and timing of the AI and cannot help with those issues that are most likely to cause the greatest frustrations: camera shudder, collision detections, and erratic career arc.  Mac-specific notes: the game performed fine - and indeed better than most Codemasters titles have for me! - crashing to desktop only 1 time. Menus are easy to negotiate and understand, although there is no slider to adjust steering sensitivity and linearity. On just a few races there was significant screen-tearing as well as general hiccups on loading screens, but for the most part these did not influence the game negatively.  EDIT: after further time with the game, new issues which have resulted in its removal from my installed library - without finishing the game campaign - have popped up. The WSR in Asia section offers a mix of race types with restricted car selection; many of these vehicles are 'grip' RWD which behave in unpredictable ways. The light track toys, for example, will sometimes drift as instructed and on other sweeping turns will not. Combining unpredictable handling response with downhill driving at high speeds and ridiculous amounts of camera shake ended with me terminating the game. Speeds that would result in my car being unable to steer were met by the AI with no issue at all, in fact the AI gained speed on some corners! The difficulty spike is understandable, but I have zero desire to grind seconds off of long, twisting races where I cannot guarantee that handling will remain the same upon application of braking and throttle. And elimination races with drift cars became simply tedious; starting in 9th with a drift car that you can not drift with - because contact with any other racer causes you to lose all steering regardless of contact point - makes it less a race and more a demo derby. The game is still recommended, but only to racers of sufficient patience and understanding to deal with the game's plethora of puzzling design schemes."
"This game is awesome, highly recommend a steering wheel"
"Not bad, but not the best racing game. If it's on sale, pick it up. If not, save your money for NFS Hot Pursuit or Dirt 3"
"After spending nearly twice as much time in Forza Horizon 3 I can say without shadow of a doubt this is a better racing game. The cars each have a learning curve and driving itself is a challenge where the reward is better handling. It doesn't have an open world map, it doesn't have a giant selection of cars, and it doesn't have Toyota ( :(((( ) but what Grid 2 does have is incredible sound design, damage models, handling, aesthetic (to a degree) and an overall better feel. It takes me back to the early 2000s sense of wonder and challenge that I felt playing the first four Gran Turismo games on the Playstation and Playstation 2. I can't say the same for Codemasters' newest title Dirt Rally since it's almost impossible to play with a controller, but if Dirt Rally's sound design, graphical fidelity and damage models are any signal of how the next Grid will be my wallet is already prying itself apart to shell out the proper amount of shekels. Get Grid 2 for a fun racing game and especially for the Touge element. Get the next Grid that ever comes out if you want to nut harder than you've ever nutted before."
to good game !!!  recomend
"pros: - Simcade - Easy to learn and handle - Variety of different maps and routes - Plenty of different game modes/disciplines - Plenty of cars to choose from - multiplayer is alive and well cons: - can be frustrating at times - too many dlcs and high price for old game  overall: get it only when discounts, that way u wont regret it"
Really frekin cool game.
"The feel of the cars is great and accurate for each type they are classified in, but the selection is extemely lacking without buying a cash grab DLC to play anything other than small handful of cars in the base game."
Awesome game that is true. I'm just confused from corner cutting detector like wtf... I cut corner and nothing and when I pass corner rly nice I get slowed by that ♥♥♥♥. Yeah and buy game with all DLC's. Without them u won't be able to complete all the achievements.
Nice racing game. Some cars are hard to handle in fullspeed and rollover too easily from bumps.
"Great racing game! Still good fun, probably better than dirt!"
"Great graphics and great story for a racing game, even better than DiRT 3 in my opinion. It brings you along a journey of becoming a at large racer and bringing up your reputation over time. Not hard to run on most computers either. Update: Game is honestly one of the smoothest games to run."

Half of my hours are spent just listening to the soundtrack lol
best racing game
"I compare this game to Mario Kart Wii, Why you ask? Because most people like a game they can master ( Yes you can master Mario Kart Wii), but its pretty hard to master, but once you do you'll love it even though im sure some people use this game to just goof off in, crash cars, and just flat out have fun! To tell you the truth thats all I did in this game for about a year (Don't worry it wasn't online) and I had a blast! I think Codemasters took out driving assists in Grid 2 to just create a new type of racing game or now that I think about it completely reverse how nearly every other racing game is. For example Forza, Gran Turismo ect. all those game are about hitting the apex of each turn perfectly and making sure to put on the brakes at the exact right time. Well in Grid 2 its just about the oppsosite you still want to to get a good angle on a turn but if you haven't already noticed you are meant to drift around every turn and if you don't like that DO NOT buy this game! because its all you do in it!   If you are looking to buy this game. 1. MAKE SURE TO GET THE DEMO FIRST! 2. Get it and its DLC when it goes on sale (Cause it gets pretty cheap)  Also playing with the keyboard is pretty good, but a Xbox 360 controller (or somthing like it) is recommended."
"Night of fire, you've better better stay  You've better better begin the prayer to play  Night of fire, come over over me  Come over over the top you'll have a night of fire  "
I recommend a very good game!
"This is one of the worse game CM has been produced. I got this one after the good experience I had with the first Grid, This game is garbage compare to the first one. There is no cockpit view, the physics feel fake. The graphics is the only good thing about the game, which is not actually much of improvment than the old one.  This game is only worth it when it cost less than $10."
Great Graphics and enjoyed the gameplay and the multiplayer!
"good arcade driving game, no in car view but not much of a problem. good with a wheel or controller. graphics look good. the game is good fun to play."
realy good
10/10
"I like this game!Nice racing locations , the cars and the sounds. I like the multiplayer too.It finds you very fast a session where you can play with other guys or with friends."
to good game !!!  recomend
Really frekin cool game.
Thought it was great. maybe add a little more difficulty at the beginning 9.5/10
"If you are looking for a game with good steering wheel support this is not the game to buy. The steering is way to sensitive and when you try and counter-steer with the wheel when the game forces you to drift every turn, you wil spin out or swerve back and forth several times until hitting a wall. I've been playing racing games for the past 11 years, and I would rather play a game from 2006."
"Game is sick, latest update is verrry nice. Soundtrack is perfect. Just need that campaign mode and I won't leave this one alone,"
"I was really looking foward to playing this game, but this game really doesn't bother to work properly. It's quite sad to be honest."
We need chinese support plz
Road rage simulator. the solo mode looks like you are playing online with your grandmother..
"Works perfect, one of the best racing games ever made."
Best racing game I've ever played! 10/10!
This would be a better game if you could just go from race to race without listening to the moronic voiceover pretending you're a social media star. I didn't buy this game so I could pretend I'm getting likes on youtube. I feel like I wasted my money because it's so annoying I'm going to have trouble playing it.
"Bought on sale after loving GRID I was hoping for something good but came away disappointed.   The cars and graphics are nice enough. Now on the bad bits. The menu system is akward and ends up intrusive to the game overall, instead of letting you get the best of it. That could be lived with if it was not for the biggest issue this game has.  It lacks the visceral experience of a RACE compared to the original. This is down to cars feeling unpredictable/non linear in their behaviour.   During gameplay there is an unmistakable feeling of driving aids being too overpowering. They don't make the game fun by taking care of a the odd blunder, they smother it sadly.   All of the above was evident from the first few minutes of gameplay, I persevered for the sake of the game for 6 hours of total gameplay. In the end I am sad to say this is a game you should 100% avoid if you want a fun and thrilling racing experience. This is not on a sim or arcade spectrum. The core gameplay just does not work here...   The original GRID left me thrilled, this just furstrated"
