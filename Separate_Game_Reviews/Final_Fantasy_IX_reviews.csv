"T-they didn't mess it up. I cry tears and rainbows.   Already tried it on mobile, so it was easier for me.  - Not ported, but adapted. You can click on different places on the field to move your character for example.  - Quick save of some sort. Works like a checkpoint system or something like this, not entirely sure. I just turned off the game occasionally without saving and when I turned it back on I just hit 'continue' and it placed me on the start of the last screen I've visited.  - New screen where you name your character. It looks good, I liked that.  - Music. It is just original FF9 score in same quality that PSone version had. Not that botched ff7-ff8 piece of s~. This one is personal, so I put it last.  Great game. 100 impressed nobles."
"I started this game in the year 2000 on PS1, got about 30% of the way through and lost my save. I have been wanting to play it all the way through since then, and this enhanced released proved to be the perfect opportunity for that. After completing it, I can say that this is without a doubt the best Final Fantasy game ever created. The story has so much heart, the visuals were ahead of their time, and the music is absolutely phenomenal. If you only play one Final Fantasy game ever, play this one.   Performance:  The game has never looked better. HD cinematics are pretty, backgrounds seem slightly upscaled, and the new character models look great and true to form. Both keyboard/mouse and controller setups are supported. Mouse support for menus and movement. Controls can be remapped. New features (like auto save) and boosters. Best of all, it's stable. I'm happy. Now let's get XV on here and I'll be even happier! ;)"
"This was one of my favorite games for the PS1. :) It's an awesome RPG with characters that grow on you. Each one has a very interesting background story that will have you remembering them for years to come.  I'm happy to see this is a perfect port of the original with added extras: HD character models, great support for mouse &amp; keyboard, optional cheats and the Steam achievements are a nice bonus, too. :)  There was one concern that had me holding my breath, remembering the quality for the music of FF7 and FF8 for PC was stripped down from their PS1 version, I was concerned that the same would happen with FF9, but thankfully it stayed true to the PS1 version. :D  If you have never played FF9, then you really should give it a try. You will love the story, the characters and the locations you visit. It's a beautiful fantasy world filled with life that will have you exploring and looking at everything and appreciating the detail instead of just running through it.  Also, back when this was released for PS1, this was THE GAME to get if you ever dated a girl who didn't like playing video games and wanted to get them into that. 5 minutes into this game and they were hooked and taking over your PS1 to play. xD  Ah, good times... ^ ^"
"TL;DR: Every long-life gamer has that particular game considered life-changing. To me, Final Fantasy IX is that game. And to me, this is the best game that a life being have ever crafted. Yes, I say “life being”, not “human”, because I’m assuming aliens have their own videogames. But they won’t be as good as Final Fantasy IX.  ---------------  Okay, here comes a very long review. I’ve been waiting this for so long. First of all, completely ignore my time count on Steam for this game. I’ve put 1000h+ into it, and I can easily make a perfect run by memory. Do you know that particular favorite movie you watch every single year? Well, I do that but with this game.   I have SO many things to comment about this game. And I need to spread them.  For those who are new into the franchise, Final Fantasy IX was a big contrast compared to the close older and newer games. Yes, they kept the turn-based battles. Yes, most of the same people worked for it. Yes, it’s considered to be part of the golden era of Square Enix. But let’s look closer to see the main differences:  Firsly, and probably the first thing to notice, is that characters are more cartoon-based. They’re not that sort of adults anymore and some of them even have a very funny, friendly looking.   The world’s aesthetics also changed a lot. Final Fantasy titles are famous for combining magic and fantasy features with metallic, cyberpunk machines. FFIX crushed that second part and they put an antique, more steampunk-like background instead of the actual machines.   The last big noticeable feature is that the class and battle system went back to the deep basics, where characters have their unique role and can only fight strictly to that [for instance, on FFVII every character could cast anything if the skill (a.k.a Materia) was properly equipped].   And now that I’ve just summarized the most basic info about FFIX… Welcome… TO THE MOST UNDERRATED TITLE OF THE WHOLE FRANCHISE!  That’s right. This game has been so irrationally denied, it makes me question humanity’s future. For Christ’s sake, even Square itself seems to be OK about forgetting this game! Lately, many hidden fans have appeared out of nowhere stating that this is their favorite FF game, but I’m not OK with this. Too late. You joined too late. The damage is already done and this title will probably never be on the top for most people. So I’ll put this game as the most underrated one. Forever.  As a vivid fan of the franchise, let me tell you something: I will NEVER understand why so many people put FFVII on Top 1. I’ve beaten that game for like 10 times already, and the question keeps coming to me every time. Have you paid attention on what you’ve played? For its year, the game was very good but the amount of flaws it has (even story-related) is just infinite. When rating a classic game, it’s just a failure when someone puts 90% nostalgia &amp; 10% trying-to-be-objective review as their analyses.   That being said, I’ll try to detail every worth-mention thing about this game and why I think it has been so underrated. Here we go.  THE STORY I’m pretty sure many people didn’t understand it. I’m not telling any proper detail for spoiler avoiding, but the story starts being pretty simplistic and easy to follow but the more you progress through it, the more complex it gets. It gets so complex at the end most people don’t understand the final boss! I guess Japanese narrators love to make those sort of mindf*cks. With that in mind, let me tell you something: this is the only game that has managed to make me cry.   I’ve never ever seen in any other game a party of characters that evolve and mentally grow as hugely as they do in FFIX. Everything is connected, from start to finish, and during your journey you’ll clearly see how much impact their personalities have onto both circumstances and other characters. Everyone has their way to see things, their values, and their past justifying their present and future actions… and somehow they all manage to change and mature. I swear this game teaches SO MANY life values through their characters.   Along with the characters, the story flows in a world that feels extremely alive and varied. Every place is just so different from the previous one.   Finally, the story is long. Very long considering how short most games are nowadays. In case you don’t know, this game was separated into 4 CD’s on the PSX version, and in a blind run it can perfectly provide 40-60h, depending on how much you want to explore and how many secrets you want to discover.   THE MUSIC It’s Nobuo Uematsu. And I could finish like this.   I mean, come on. It’s one of the most iconic video game composers. How do you expect to be the music? With hundreds of tracts, FFIX soundtrack is just over the top and unique, and together with its partners (VI, VII, VIII, X…) it will be one of the most remarkable soundtracks from PSX. Ever.  THE CHARACTERS My god, where to start…  As I have stated before, this game has some of the most powerful characters in the franchise, by far. All of them feel extremely unique and relevant, and you will PERFECTLY follow their progress and grow during the story. It is just amazing to see how varied every personality is, and how much impact it can bring to the plot. You might not like one particular way of thinking, but soon enough you’ll realize it’s there to make you think; everyone is different and we all have different points of view. And they have to be relevant. And yes, they are in FFIX. Just see all Vivi’s maturation and I dare you, I double f*cking dare you; I dare you to tell me you haven’t learnt anything from it.   Also, I want to highlight some aspects as well: Those are NOT your conventional Square Enix characters. That’s right. The main character (Zidane) is not the emo, cold-blooded guy from the famous FF games. Instead, it’s one of the first main characters of the franchise that constantly share optimism to his crew; stays on their side; puts himself and his life on risk (even when he knows he can’t do everything) to save the others, even people he doesn’t know, and he doesn’t hesitate to do so.   Last but not least: the main villain is acclaimed to be one of the best of the franchise (together with Kefka). No more super-emo guys; this is the kind of cynic who’s always a step forward and who loves to make fun of the rest.   THE UNDERRATINGS So why is this game so underrated? To be honest, I don’t fully know. I know the reasons that puts this game on top but not why it’s been that ignores for the media.   Maybe the fact that every character has their unique role in fighting was not that appealing to people? Something I don’t understand either. To me, that makes MUCH more sense rather than seeing a brute-force guy casting a summon spell. Really.  Maybe the friendly look of the characters? Is this seriously a con to you? They look amazing to me, and definitely much better than all those weeaboo-jpop-like characters Square keeps doing in the recent games.  Maybe because it has no futuristic machines? In that case you’re just a close-minded person. And you definitely can’t appreciate how magnificent some places (like   Lindblum  ) are.  Maybe the story looked boring to you? Then there’s no doubt you didn’t understand it. It is INFINITE TIMES more robust than FFVII storyline, and definitely way more polished, and interesting. Seriously stop overhyping that game.  In the end, every time I replay this game I start it with a feeling of “meh, I’m sure I love it because of nostalgia”. But that banishes when I reach the credits. This is still the best game I’ve ever played in my entire life, and I’ve played THOUSANDS, and completed about 700 probably. So go and buy it, see what I mean, experience this masterpiece and overall enjoy every minute of it."
Now all we need is chrono trigger!
My first Hour of Game play Consisted of sitting there and trying my best to get 1000 jumps in Jump Rope still Havn't done it but i will not surrender
"Took me 15 years to finish it, but atleast I can't scratch my discs this time!"
"My favorite episode of the Final Fantasy saga. Full of magic, dragons, princess, queen, knights, secrets, romance, funny scenes, lovely soundtrack (!), awesome story, and much more.  What else would you want from a fantasy game? I played this 16 years ago and I'm playing it again, planning to complete it. If you never played this, don't look at the graphic, it's an old game yes but it will last more than the 10 hours game they sell nowdays and you will never forget it. If you already played it? Well, play it again, enjoy it again, you grew up, it will be a different experience. 10/10"
"It's FFIX - On STEAM! The lack of true widescreen support is disappointing but understandable. The 30fps lock is disappointing but understandable. The mobile UI? Atrocious! The price? Too high! But the HD character models look great (even if they clash with the hand drawn backgrounds. The HD cutscenes look great (even if they are letterboxed) and the new options are fun to play with.  At the end of the day - it's FFIX on PC. It looks great, plays well, runs good and I'm just happy to have it. It's a great experience. Hopefully mods will make it an even better experience on PC."
" This is hands-down, no doubt about it, the definitive version of FFIX"
Vivi is a cinnamon roll. Too precious for this world. Too pure.  Protect Vivi.
"To this day, I have yet to find a game with as much heart as this one. Still my favorite game of all time, that's all I can say. FF9 is a masterpiece, and it needs to be experienced"
So far it runs very well! Installed and started to play no problem. Graphics look amazing and it brings back childhood memories hearing that Nobuo Uematsu soundtrack :D
I'm a 33 yr old masculine man full of testosterone. Yet the amazing soundtrack and story softens me with loads of youthful nostalgia and sends me back in time to what human relationships are all about. One can't help but connect with characters that are a creation of another person's imagination. Want to experience what I experience?
 A true classic everyone should play. Kupo!
"I forgot how much I liked this game. For me, this is the best Final Fantasy next to FF6. The new character models look great, and while some of the backgrounds seem blurry, it is an improvement over the original. Like everyone has said before, the models stand out over the lower res backgrounds, but you quickly get used to it. It's a great port, and I recommend playing it with a 360 controller. I haven't had any issues so far."
"Got the game for a review but that doesn't change how I feel about it. When I was younger my mother was constantly sick and in the hospital I was doing what I could to pay off a PS1 I had on lay away at Wal-Mart. My father was the only person working and he surprised me by paying off the rest of the console and a few weeks later also got me Final Fantasy IX and I fell in love with it.  The game the story, the music it all struck a chord with me and helped me cope emotionally because of everything going on in my life was pretty abysmal and honestly being able to play it again just brings back all the memories and the ending song 'Melodies of life' made me feel so calm and relaxed.   For the record my mother is still alive, has died eight times and she keeps reviving like Captain Jack Harkness from Doctor Who.   ~Gamers-Haven  [gamers-haven.org] "
"30 hours in and I'm still searching for more moogles to deliver letters to. Pretty sure I'm doing a better job of delivering mail than the Royal Mail does. 10/10. Would deliver mail again.  Seriously though; great game and a good port, I've not encountered any issues so far.  Positives: The story. The characters. The music. Main character models are now high res. High res FMVs. It now exists on PC.  Negatives: The backgrounds weren't redone, which can look a little weird with the higher res character models until you get used to it.  Would it be nice if the backgrounds had been redone? Sure. Is it a dealbreaker? No.  Overall rating: 9.5/10.  Brings back the feels from the times I played it on my PSOne with that awesome 5' LCD screen attached."
"A beautiful oldschool Game !  if you sit about 3 Meters away from your Display -&gt; it looks sharp ;)  on the other hand, if you sit closer (like me) then you love the oldschool PS1 look  + exciting Story + excellent Soundtrack + nice oldschool Graphic + lovely Characters  One of the best old FF Games -&gt; Unrestricted buy recommendation :)"
"A gallant looking dual-wielding space monkey with a knack for both chivalry and thievery captures the most babe-alicious beauty in all of Alexandria only to end up in a plot Stephen King can't get baked enough to dream about? This game is art, play it."
" The world of Final Fantasy IX is The Place I'll Return To Someday, almost every year... Kupo!"
The best Final Fantasy game.   Period.
16 years later and this game still feels like coming home every time. ♥
"I guess the keys to a good Squeenix port are: 1) Don't have a PC release already (VII, VIII) 2) Don't be 2D/Sprite-based (V, VI) 3) Don't be ports of a flawed DS release (III, IV) 4) Put time and effort into it!  Seriously. This port is their best port yet (which is saying a lot, yet not much at the same time). And they have another one (of X's Remastered edition) coming out in a few days.  -The FPS is still 30, but that's forgivable on the basis that it's a PS1 game. Definitely a lot less jarring than the 30-to-15 reduction that IV and III see during battle sequences. -Unlike the other PS1/PC titles, they actually used the PS1 soundfont, so the music on the PS1 and the PC is identical, unlike VII and VIII which used a generic PC soundfont. The music even loops right (unlike I's iOS/Android port, or V or VI's ports! -The UI is a lot less intrusive than you'd expect, since this port kept the iOS/Android UI. The battle menus in particular are large enough to be visible from several feet away even on a smaller computer, but still not big enough to really take up half the screen. After a while, it actually, dare I say it, looks pretty good that way, since there's little empty space to be seen in these menus. -The GRAPHICS! The original game had the characters look incredibly pixelated (not that that was really Squaresoft's fault), but this game looks absolutely amazing (as though they rebuilt the textures from the ground up). Prerendered environments still look a bit out of place, but the models are pristine.  And as far as the game itself goes, nothing has changed. It's refreshing that they didn't add anything (boosters aside) but didn't subtract anything either, meaning there's no real sense reviewing the game itself here when you can look a really good one from 2000 up with no problem.  If you have never played Final Fantasy IX, or if you have and would like some amazing nostalgia, or if you're an RPG lover, or hell, if you're a human being with a soul, play this game."
"One of the greatest games of all times.  I always thought Baka was a pigman,   improved graphics now tell me he is a bat-man.  10/10, they did not mess this up."
I used to watch my brother playing Final Fantasy IX but now I'm playing it by myself.... oh memories...
"If you didn't like Final Fantasy VII or VIII, then it's worth trying out IX. If you liked VII and disliked VIII, then it's worth trying out IX. If you disliked VII and liked VIII, then it`s worth trying out IX. If you liked VII and VIII, then it's worth trying out IX.  The point is, Final Fantasy IX seemed to mix the best of both VII and VIII, wrapped them in a fun, colorful fantasy setting where many races coexist as if all life is normal with one of the most addictive card games ever imagined, and as the topper, made the continents fun to explore with several secrets for the most dedicated. While the rating doesn't agree with me, I honestly believe Final Fantasy IX is a fun way to introduce RPGs to all ages, and being able to replay it remastered made me relive me playing through it as a child. Definitely a contender for one of my favorite games of all time.  Most reviews point out the mobile UI used in the game, but honestly, I like it a little more. If you look at comparison screenshots between the PC/Mobile and PS1, the crisp, easy-to-read UI wins out for me. Granted, this could be my poor eyesight, but that seems to be the one thing most complain about.  To me, this game helped me relive my childhood again. With a five-week old beside me, I hope he'll be able to play this and enjoy it just as his dad did."
"This is the definitive version Final Fantasy IX!  Despite it being a DIRECT mobile port, you could not tell had you not known this.  +HD Cutscenes are BEAUTIFUL + HD Character Models looks great + Boosters (cheats) help out a TON! + There's graphics settings from 480 to 1080p + Game runs buttery SMOOTH on my HP Stream 11 Notebook which falls FAR under the minimum requirements need for this game. Don't even worry about being able to run this. I can run it in 1366 x 768 on this hunk of plastic! NO frame drops at all  Honestly, there's nothing I can say bad about it, and that's surprising since the PC port of FFV and VI were horrible!  Unintentionally the best lazy mobile port ever  9/10 srs"
"I lost count of how how many times I completed FF IX. This is the first time I completed it on Steam and it still is one of my favourite games ever. Honestly I still think this is Sakaguchi's masterpiece.  Even 16 years after I played it for the first time, the game impresses me to no end. One of the reasons why I like this particular entry in the series is because of how diverse Gaia is. Sure there is room for the fairytale-like kingdom of Alexandria, but soon enough you'll wander around in Lindblum, the giant city where everybody is working on the technology that will help the people of Gaia in the future. These are just some of the general examples, but I still love how this world has a bit of everything: technology, magic, different cultures, a diverse cast of people walking around... this is what I consider 'fantasy'. Sure, everyone's definition of fantasy is wildly different, but in FF IX it just feels right. Exploring the world is still a joy and the majority of locations you will visit haven't lost their charm.   Another reason why I still love this game is because of the amazing cast of characters it has. Zidane is a great protagonist who steps away from the sulking and overly 'too cool for school' leads like Cloud and Squall in the earlier Final Fantasy-titles. Don't get me wrong, this is not to slam on those characters. But it still feels like a fresh breath of air to see the friendly and sociable Zidane supporting his friends through the game. And being a bit of a ladies man. I wish more FF leads would be like him. And of course... who can forget Vivi, the little Black Mage who could! Vivi remains one of my favourite characters in the series. The young mage stumbles through the game looking for answers he won't like, but he powers through and comes to face his personal demons. It's impossible to hate the little guy. Garnet/Dagger might be the one who keeps doubting herself, but eventually becomes a great and strong lead as well. As for the others... Steiner remains funny as the comic relief of the game, but you respect his sense of duty. Freya and Amarant seem a bit underdeveloped, but luckily they get their moments too. Eiko has fun scenes too and Quina... well... she's Quina right? She just likes frogs man. The many supporting characters are great too. The Tantulas gang always have a knack for getting a smile on your face, Regent Cid will (gwok) suprise you with antics (ribbit) and who can forget the mad queen, Brahne? Lots of memorable characters all around.   Gameplay is solid; it's the FF battlesystem/equipment you know and love, but this time easier to grasp (thank god!) than FF VIII's overly complicated junction system. Just just equip items to lean skills and voila; awesome moves you can use. One thing I do appreciate about this Steam version are the enhanced loading times. In the original PS version loading times were long and over time made it harder to fully enjoy the game. It made sense, because back then FF IX was asking a lot of the PSone hardware. But now on a pretty fast PC the game runs smoothly and with quick loadtimes. It's so fast, I've reached the end after only 31 hours. With the original release it would atleast take me 40(!) to get at the same point. So kudos for that. But if the many fights start to tire you out, why not enjoy several fun sidequest with great rewards? Or even some minigames, like the amazing Chocobo Hot and Cold, where you can dig up items and treasure locations? Especially with a high level Choco it's amazingly fun to hunt for treasure. I could go on for hours, but really, check it out for yourself!  I could go on for a few more pages, but at a certain point you just want to stop reading. So here's my final say on this amazing game; for me Final Fantasy IX is the last great FF game to be made. It's truly a shame we'll never see another game like this from Sakaguchi. With IX he created an amazing world with loveable characters, wonderfull places to visit and more importantly, an adventure worthy of your time. Helped by Uematsu's amazing soundtrack Final Fantasy IX still remains as one of the best games in the series. Your really should play it."
the nostalgia train would never stop
100 Steam users were impressed. Queen Brahne was not impressed.
Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark  For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart...

"I remembered watching my older brothers playing this game. Then falling in love with it and wanting to play it. By the time I was old enough, it was too late to even play it because our PS1 disappeared and PS2 was born. I have been waiting for this moment for years. And now it's finally come.   Finally.  Vivi is cute AF, btw.  Music is still as amazing as before. Characters are too. Everything is just amazing. Even though I agree that the background is not as great as the updated characters, at least I can still navigate my way around.   This was so worth the wait.  "
"First things first: THIS is how you do a port. Not the sign-up-for-Square-account-MIDI-soundtrack-and-drastically-change-UI-and-max-720p-for-HD-game disasters that were the last few ports.  Kudos to Square for knocking this one out of the ball park. I hope it's a sign of good PC ports to come.   The subtle UI changes to this game are what I would consider improvements and aren't very intrusive. Aside from the that, the game is basically the same PS1 game from 2000 and that is a good thing! It was my personal introduction to the Final Fantasy franchise, and left a good enough impression on me to remember Vivi and the other cast years later and play the rest of the games. Great mini-games like frog catching, Tetra Master, jump roping, and Chocobo Hot and Cold are all in place and a very unique ability system that plays nice with the classic FF jobs still holds up today. I couldn't recommend this game enough. Buy it. Have a blast."
Many years back when I was 11 or 12 years old I decided to go through my brother's wardrobe and in there gathering dust was a game amongst other things. I picked up the game and placed it into my PlayStation 1 and title screen for Final Fantasy IX appeared. I was drawn to it as I played and I fell in love with it. It was a game that made me love Final Fantasy and RPG's in general. FFIX is a game unlike any other and don't be fooled by my playtime here because all together over every save I've got I've easily racked over 400 hours into this game. This is my favourite game of all time and I recommend it to anyone no matter what. The achievements make this release on steam great. This perfect game should be played by all.
"I never got the chance of playing this game back in the day (because I didn't own a console) so first I wanna say a wholehearted THANK YOU to Square Enix for porting this game to the PC. I hope FFXII and FFXV will follow suit, especially now since FFX/X-2 HD is released. With that said onto the review!   I was skeptical at first regarding this game because I've heard so much good things about it but on the other hand it wasn't really a 'hit' in terms of sales (it didn't get to the popularity of VII), but rather than it got a cult following which I can appreciate. And because of that I decided to try it out having never played it before but hearing good things about it.   So here I am at the end of it and I must say that it surprised me completely with it's characters that were very well developed (especially Dagger &amp; Vivi and let's not forget how awesome Quina is). I got so much into playing this game for the past couple of days without stopping until I finally reached the finish line.   It's one of the most 'complete' Final Fantasy games in the franchise that I have played and it has managed to reached 1# on the FF games list for me followed by FFVII and FFX.   Do I recommend this game? YES! Especially If you are into old school RPG's with an ATB system, it's charming characters and a soundtrack that will make you sometimes sad and sometimes happy.  PS: This must be mentioned, but the PC only features that Square have implemented in these Final Fantasy ports in terms of boosters have been a godsend for those who want to go back and play the game out of nostalgia or for those that don't have hours and hours to grind through and make the minigames enjoyable."
"I think this is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. It doesn't quite edge out VI or Tactics, but it's right up there with IV and XII.  This is a port of the old Playstation game from 2000, and if you aren't a little baby, there's a good chance you've played that version. If you have, you don't really need any type of review, as nothing has really changed. If you haven't played this entry in the series for whatever reason, say maybe VII and VIII were too different for you, IX is very much a return to basics.  Where as in VII the characters are largely interchangeable aside from their limit breaks due to the materia system, in IX we're back to each character having their own set combat commands and feeling like a unique class. Extra abilities come attached to various equipment, and if you wear the equipment and earn enough AP from fights, you can master the ability and use it without having that piece of equipment equipped on the character. This still doesn't let you learn any ability on anyone you want; just because you can equip an item on a character doesn't mean they can use the abilities it has. You're probably not going to learn magic on a melee type character for instance, even if he is using a hat that has cure magic on it.  Like the somewhat recent Steam port of VII (and I assume VIII, I don't have that one on Steam) this version has some added options to help you speed through the game if you just want to experience the story. You can easily make everyone max level, learn abilities instantly, and max out your gil. They've also given us higher resolution cutscenes and character models. These aren't actually new assets or new cutscenes, they just look better than what the Playstation version had since they don't really have to worry about disc space anymore.  Sadly, that's really all the extras we got. It really would have been nice to get some of the extras that VI had in its recent iOS/PC port. With that game you got some extra espers, a new dungeon that was much more difficult than anything else in the game, and a new in game bestiary. I know these weren't made specifically for the PC port, and were carried over from the older GBA port of VI, but still... I mean, couldn't they have at least added some small stuff, like making the right stick turn the camera on the world map?  The lack of new features / content aside, I can't really find anything bad to say about this game. I'm hardly what I'd call a fanboy of the series, and this is still a really good jrpg. If you're into this genre, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than Final Fantasy IX."

"This game is personal favourite and dear to my heart. It's an underrated Final Fantasy, and has by far the longest and most in-depth storyline. You're looking at 40hrs+ for a 'quick' first playthrough. There's so much to explore, and  ALOT  you can miss if you don't take your time. The characters are compelling and believable. The mini-games are amazing. I really only have nice things to say about this game. I personally boot it up every 2 or so years to give it another play.   As a hardcore fan of this game, I have no complaints.  10/10 // 4 copies owned (disks/backup disks/PSN/Steam)"
"I just finished the game and what can i say, this game is my favorite game. The storyline the soundtrack and the graphics is just great. I can just recommend for everyone."
"Not only is this one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time, it runs smoother than a babies bottom across the bottom of a icey floor. Graphics are amazing and its cheaper than buying the old Ps1 copy by 50%"
"This was my first Final Fantasy. 5/5 It was great then, and it's great now."
"This is a pretty good port of one of the best entries in this series.  If your a PAL gamer (European) then i strongly advise you buy this PC version since the PAL PS1 version is super slow, while the PC version runs pretty fast even more than the original NTSC version in USA.  Quality of the FMVs, 3D Models have made a good transition for all available resolutions in 1080p HD.  I'm glad Square Enix released this game to PC because this is one of the best FF games ever. The game goes back to its more traditional routes of gameplay but with characters on fixed job roles, the story is imo the best in the series.  I love the romance, comedy and drama with all of these characters with Vivi being my most favourite character in this game and you become pretty attached to this character instantly at the start of the game to the end.  Will say that if anyone passed on this game because it looks kiddy like... then dont because your missing out on this game you should be open to try games that take on a different art direction, tho this game does have the characters more cartoonish and really hilariously goofy it doesn't go overboard with it, it takes the story pretty seriously but not getting to the point where it gets too dark or too silly in fact about 80% of the game is done pretty cleverly.  The music is very good yet composed by Nobuo Uematsu.  My only negative feels on this game are pretty minor. Im not a fan of Amarant as a character since his back story and reason to exist in this game feels phoned in and he doesn't feel significant to the plot of this game at all similar to how Squaresoft treated Yuffie and Vincent in the original FF7 game (because they were optional characters).  I really dont like the Limit Breaks in this game which is 'Trance' because if your bar fills up your going to transform if you like it or not which can throw stragety out the window if your tackling an enemy your not prepared for or you want to save it for that one boss.  Another thing that bothers me on this game as a completionist is that this is the hardest FF game to 100% because of Perfect Runs, speed runs to get Excalibur 2 (without perks), the grind to level 99 on chocobo hot n cold, so many missable items, even small sidequests, that freaking 1000 jumps in a row as Vivi or Eiko takes alot of time and perfection to get down.    "
"The wait is over, my favorite FF game is finally on Steam! I won't comment on the actual game since it came out 16 years ago and y'all should have a pretty good idea of what it is. I will however comment on the quality of the Steam release. Now I know that it's been out on Android for some time now, but having not played the mobile version, I cannot compare the two.  - After reading some reviews (both negative and positive) and the forums, I wasn't expecting my Xbox One controller to work without getting a Joy2Key and performing the 'run the game, then connect the controller when you get to the options menu'  black  magic. To my surprise, the controller worked right away. No tweaking, assigning controls or any use of keyboard+mouse was involved while I was playing.   - Some said that they don't have an option to choose the 1080 resolution, I wouldn't know why that happens since I didn't encounter that issue.  - Reworked fonts and menus look crispy clean. I didn't think it would matter until I saw it!  - I'm not a fan of filters/other emulation enhancements and I took a moment to compare the standard emulation to the Steam release. The difference between the two is colossal. Yes, the static backgrounds haven't changed all that much but the new character models textures make more than enough difference.   - The new autosave feature is extremely useful and works flawlessly. For some of us who has gained real life responsibilities since the last time we played FF9 this is an actual lifesaver.  - Unlike FF7 and FF8, it was never ported to PC before so the MIDI sound issue 7 and 8 Steam releases had is not present.  To sum up my first impressions, I think the Steam version looks fantastic. This  does  feel like playing a remastered game. I know there's a lot of disagreement on what a remastered game should look like since the level of expectations goes from low to realistic to unrealistically high, but in my opinion this is a remaster worth playing."
"Ok. Let's sort some fact from the fiction here.  A) All controls are configurable in game. Whoever says there is no controller/keyboard config hasn't actually opened the game yet.  B) If your character is always moving in a direction, it's your controller. 90% of controller users and 100% of keyboard users are just fine.  C) If you think the combat is 'too slow' try increasing the battle speed in the menu. Don't put the battle speed on slow and complain it's too slow.  D) Yes the backgrounds are pretty bad. It's definitely noticeable.  E) Yes the UI is large and a bit in the way. I, personally, don't mind it; but I can see where other's might.  F) If you can watch TV without going blind, the framerates in this game won't bother you.   Honestly, it's not the greatest port of all time, but the inconveniences are more than made up for by included conveniences like instantly know who plays cards, not having to learn abilities if you don't want to, starting with max money or xp, etc. I give the port an 8.5/10. I am very satisfied with it. But the fuzzy backgrounds are annoying.  "
"Even though the steam version is a bit clunky due to being a direct port of the IOS version, that doesn't change the fact that his game is a masterpiece. As is well known, FFIX went back to the roots of the franchise, with the four-person party and set jobclasses, as well as making it more, well, fantasy-baed rather than the more sci-fi that FFVII and FFVIII went with.  PROS and CONS: +Incredible Music (It's Nobuo Uematsu, what'd you expect?) +Very well-written and thought out characters. +Classic FF Gameplay at its finest. +Great story. Not much to say about this one other than it's just good. +Pretty darn nice graphics. (Considering this was originally a Playstation 1 game)  -A few minor graphical glitches. -The fact that it still uses the IOS menu layout is a bit weird.  Overall, I don't have much to say here. This game is just really flipping good. Very strongly reccomend."
"I can only see positive aspects to that version : No need to plug the old PS and TV Looks better (even if it's not a full HD remaster) It's also probably cheaper than buying 2nd hand PS version now More saving slots...  The only thing I struggled with is the invasive battle menu, but I could live with it. Thanks Square for this, as it's the most most underestimated FF of the PS era. Next step : Chrono Cross ?"
"good one same as console version and they improve some UI  + they add point &amp; click mechanism + improvements on battle interfaces &amp; menu interfaces + talk and card game icon when you meet npc + better polygon on character than console version  + advanced mode (99999 gils, OP mode, no monster mode etc)  - movies are still 30 fps (or less?) - still using 4:3 dimension (yeah like FF VII and FF VIII steam ver)  and more"
"TL;DR: Greatest RPG and videogame of all time, followed by Xenogears. An unique masterpiece and the best FF ever, you can't be a gamer if you didn't spend 400hr playtime on this game. Memories and feels are there, it literally destroyed my hype for Dark Soul III. There's nothing left, just Final Fantasy IX."
"In my opinion, this one is one of the best JRPG's ever. It is also the best Final Fantasy game. Released after some previous experimental installments, FFIX aggregates everything good from series history. Featuring one of the best 32-bit era graphics and fairy tale-like, but solid story, this game is truly a 2000s classic, a must-play gem of its genre, just like FFVI or Chrono Trigger. As the last PS1-era installment, Final Fantasy IX is a bit overshadowed by much more successful FFVII, that's why it is not so popular. This game is a turning point between classic FF's, which made series great, and later ones, which met more mixed reviews. I recommend FFIX to anyone who is a fan of JRPG (if somehow you've missed it yet) and for everyone interested in acquiring a first taste of the genre."
Still trying to master jump rope........
"This is the Best port Square ever Made   just need to fix the Backgrounds,   "
"After replaying this, the memories of why it was my favorite Final Fantasy came back in full force. If you are a RPG fan you owe it to yourself to at least give this one a try."
"I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan! I even love XIII. First played IV as II in the US as a kid. VI is probably my favorite so far and its a shame how it was butchered in the mobile port and by proxy, the PC release. I played about an hour of IX when it was originally released because I was just going into college and time was something that was in short supply. Now, I'm loving going back and playing IX. It's fantastic. If you didn't like VIII, give IX a try.  This PC release is fantastic! They did a great job. If you're wary because of the VI remake, worry not. This one is a winner!"
I was never able to finish the game because disk 3 was damaged on my PS1.  Playing this game again was a awsome experience.  -Pros  Story Unique characters Good Port Graphics Openworld  -Cons  FPS capped
"If you never played a Final Fantasy game in your life, this is the game to start with.   My reasons being:  1. The characters. Zidane is one of the best MCs if not the best thanks to his charming personality and his desire to help others without any real reason. It's also nice to see the cast mature as the game progresses. Also, Vivi.  2. The story. I can't really explain this one without spoiling it. Just know that the plot only goes forward, there is never a single moment I hated in this game. There are some plot twists that are well done.  3. The soundtrack. Nobuo Uematsu at his finest. Every track fits with the scene and perfectly captures the mood. Melodies of Life is one of the greatest pieces composed in the Final Fantasy franchise.  4. How much you can truly appreciate it after you played it. You see, this was my first Final Fantasy game. Since then, I played every other core Final Fantasy title (I'm excluding XI and XIV since they're MMOs.) and when you decide to pick up Final Fantasy IX again, you'll realize what the game truly is. It's a thank you letter to everyone that played the game. The game is filled with so many allusions to its predecessors.  And to conclude this totally biased review, some poetry from a man with fabulous hair.  'Peace is but a shadow of death, Desperate to forget its painful past. Though we hope for promising years. After shedding a thousand tears, Yesterday's sorrow constantly nears. And while the moon still shines blue, By dawn, it will turn to scarlet hue.'"
"Where to start? This is mother flipping FINAL FANTASY IX My 2nd favorite FF game with FF6 PSX/Super Famicom (FF3 Super Nintendo) and is one of the best of the series. To me 6 will always be the best for me with 12 being my 3rd favorite.  The game has some glitches (Launch) in the menus if you get hit by one do not fret you can close the game and reopen it. What you did not save for a while? Click on CONTINUE and it will brning you back to the room you was in prior to the crash of the menu. I was placing all the abilities on the group and I could not go out of the menu. I said darn it '2 hours' of play gone but there was this title menu that says 'Continue' and I clicked that to see what it would do and viola I was back to where I left off at the start of the room. (Yes AUTOSAVE) HOWEVER be forwarned save a lot on the overworld or you may lose play if you glitch out again.   I am not one for not saving. But some people are and they forget to save . So you may have to do a boss battle over again, no big deal. Thanks Square Enix for that.   Graphics are no better than if you was to play this on a phone. (Although why anyone would do so because a tiny screen) The only thing I disliked about this whole thing was them annoucing it to be out in Feburary but did not get release until April 2016. But I see why now. It is still glitchy hence the 'black screen of death' I got and that BSoD did not lose much other than repurchasing and equiping equipment.  People have been complaning about the audio. 'Sounding off' as they say or 'sounds compressed' while YES this is true, it is NOT the Final Fantasy VII midi sound quality. It is not enough to detract from the game itself tho. It sounds good enough for me. All I can suggest is either play the OST in the backgorund and time it.. mute your tv... or deal with it. Maybe they will come out with a patch to remedy this but doubt it.  This game is worth 20.99 so if you miss off on launch sale, you can get it for that, or wait till the end of the year sale or Squares publisher sale...   Okay PROS:  * Nostalgia Nostalgia Nostalgia..  *Added cheats if you so desire to be lazy. *Grapics are better. *AUTO SAVE everytime you change screens. *Full USB Contoller support . *The ability to skip cutscenes. *Fast Forward button 'F1'  *Did I mention Nostagia (for us 30-40 something players)   CONS *Has a menu glitch (will strike trough when this is fixed) *Compressed music, but it is very tolerable. *No auto detect to change what to press when you are playing via keyboard to game controller. I had to relearn a few buttons. *Frame rates are stuck at 30fps for non cutscene screens 15fps for the cutscreen... *Does not save the 'Cheats toggles' on reloads of saves.  *Having to click play after I chosen my resolution everytime I start up.  This little gem is one you should play even after FF VIII made you decide to stop playing after that game. I just do not like the mechanics within. Square Soft made up with it in FF IX. It is worth buying."
"Final Fantasy 9 is a game from my childhood. A game I have really fond memories of. In a lot of ways it's a game all about nostalgia.  Final Fantasy 9 takes place in a very cutesy chibi fantasy world where steampunk technologies like airships are just starting to become a thing. You play as Zidane, an amusing rogue who initially starts his quest on a mission to kidnap a princess. A far cry from the cold and distant protagonists of Cloud Strife and Squall Leonheart. However the plot gradually opens up into a very long quest as you eventually explore the world and encounter it's inhabitants.  The characters are where the game truly nails it. All of the party members in Final Fantasy 9 are memorable. Your black mage Vivi is insecure and always nervous. And Zidane and Vivi gradually grow into this almost brotherly bond with one another. Your princess Garnet yearns for adventure and over the course of the storyline develops a very pleasant romance with the protagonist. You eventually pick up her bodyguard Steiner, a perpetually aggravated knight sworn to protect her. And even more fantastical party members like Freya, an anthropomorphic rat clad in armor who joins the party looking for her long lost love. And Quina, a bizarre creature who has abilities based on enemies you allow him to consume. All of the party members in Final Fantasy 9 are great. I remembered all of them and the way they interact with each other and develop over the course of the story is a real treat.  The battle system in 9 takes from the previous games in numerous ways. The ATB system returns and they increased the amount of party members you can have in a single battle to 4 just like the pre-7 games. What I like about this release of the game in particular is it allows you to select elements of the user interface using the mouse. Which is very convenient and reduces the amount of fumbling through the menu that it usually would with the controller.  This is the first time Final Fantasy 9 has ever been released off the original Playstation so there are a few things to note if you've played Final Fantasy 7 or 8's PC ports. It doesn't let you use linear filtering like the original PS1 version, it uses a bilinear filter. For most people this won't be that big of a deal but it does look different compared to how you're used to. Otherwise it lets you play the game either with a controller or with a keyboard/mouse. And lets you control the user interface using the mouse which is a real treat to me. They also added an autosave feature and numerous little quirks into the game like allowing you to skip cutscenes.  One other thing to note is this isn't a full remake of Final Fantasy 9. The FMVs are the same, as are the 2D backgrounds and the 3D models. The only major differences I've noticed in the port compared to the original PS1 version are changes in the user interface. And like 7 and 8's PC ports it lets you optionally enable cheats to make you super powerful at the start of the game. So far the only major issue I've noticed is related to controller sensitivity so I hope that gets promptly fixed.  The entire game has this feeling of going back to something special. The soundtrack especially is full of very soft and somber themes that hearken back to childhood. It's a game that makes you feel like you're a kid again, and makes you want to return to old games you grew up with.

"I'm a big fan of old school Final Fantasy games and I love this port. Sure, backgrounds are little blury, but overall this is good port and great game to get on PC platform. "
"'After all this time?'  'Always,' said Snape."
"From a young age, I've had a huge crush on General Beatrix, and now all those thoughts are rushing back to me.   Steiner was never good enough for her... &gt;_&gt;  10/10 would fantasize about Beatrix again.  YES - if you too enjoy some General Beatrix. NO - If you have no idea who I'm talking about (SHAME ON YOU!) Or just think I'm weird. FUNNY - if you would rather Princess Garnet or Eiko (eww)... Or god forbid Freya. Or Quina... I won't judge.  ------------------ The game itself is worth the wait. Whether you're a ol' veteran of the game, or this is your first time. It won't matter, the story, soundtrack and gameplay is beyond awesome.   And Beatrix. 'Nuff said! Have fun you wonderful people."
"Ok here goes Big FF fan, though this game passed me by somehow when I was younger so this was my first time playing it  I didn't know what I was missing out on. It's not the BEST game in my opinion but it's up there in the top three for me.  I don't want to spoil ANYTHING so I won't really go into much detail, but i'd definitely recommend this game if you like the other games. Curl up for a weekend or on a holiday and play through it like I did, you won't regret it. Comfy doesn't even begin to do this game justice.  Plot - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Combat/Item and Ability systems - 10/10 Length - 10/10 Muh Feels - 8/10  Overall enjoyment - 9/10"
"Its Final Fantasy IX, on PC.... What more do you want....  ...oh a review? ill just summarize these things  I can honestly say this is for the fans of the franchise, I can't really see many newcomers coming to the old Final Fantasy titles, but If your looking for a solid rpg with good humour/story/classic gameplay then you might enjoy this.  Pros +Its Final Fantasy IX......on PC  +One of the best FF's...nay the BEST FF ever made, and that is totally not a purely subjective opinion its just cold hard fact....ahem   Cons -Playing at HD you can see the pixilated, blurriness of the backgrounds, which unfortunately are ripped straight from the original and 'upscaled'  -Again playing on a widescreen format you will be playing in 4:3, due to how this game was made, not really a con, just something you should know.  Wishlist  I hope some amazing artists and modders could unite to remake the pre-rendered backgrounds, or at least make use of some of the high res images found at this post here  http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=551612 "
"All right, I'm not going to talk a lot about why you should get this game. Plenty of other people already have, and many can be found right on this page. So I'm going to assume that you already know it's a good game. (Although just to add my own two cents to that matter: FF9 is, to this day, the only RPG - and very nearly the only game - that I have played all the way through to the end multiple times, and since getting it, I don't think I've ever gone more than two years without finishing it at least once.) Instead, I'd like to talk specifically about this version.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game (overall, I am still recommending it, after all), and everything that made it a great game is still here. But that's kind of the trouble - what makes it a great game is pretty much only what was already there in its original PlayStation release. Fun fact: the textures and backgrounds stored on the discs in the game's original release were actually quite a bit higher quality than the PlayStation was actually capable of rendering and displaying at the time. And sadly, it seems the devs were aware of this, because pretty much no effort went into updating anything except maybe the main characters a little. It seems like all they did for the backgrounds was simply blur the textures a little to hide the pixelation which probably works well enough at lower resolutions that are still higher than the original, but becomes pretty apparent at what I at least assume is close-to-standard gaming PC resolutions of 1600x900 and 1920x1080. Ironically, I think these would have looked much better had they actually put in even less effort, and just left them pixelated. I mean, they originals are almost pixel art as far as pre-rendered backgrounds go. The FMV cutscenes are spectacular however, and it's really great getting to see them without the resolution limitations of the PlayStation, however there are a few in-game cutscenes that use rendered models and the pre-rendered backgrounds and because of the slapdash update, these are borderline horrific. Thankfully, they are few and far between, and never more than a couple of seconds long, so they don't ruin the experience.  All in all, this supposedly 'updated' rerelease is about what I had expected, though not what I had hoped for. Luckily, compared to plenty of other 15 year old games, it already had spectacular graphics that I, at least, think aged fairly well even in their original state, so it's probably only going to be hardcore fans of the game (like myself) who might be tempted to claw their eyeballs out. Ultimately, my recommendation is that if possible, you should actually get the original game. Just last year I finished a playthrough on my PS2 using a respectable 1080p widescreen TV, and it was just as beautiful there as I always remembered. However, if that's not feasible for you, I still recommend you at least get this version given that it is definitely what I would consider one of the must-play classics of gaming history - for its own merits, not simply its influences.  And even slapdash and hasty as this rerelease was, I don't regret purchasing a second copy one bit. Just... be aware.  P.S. Some other notes: - The sound seems to... I'm not sure what the technical terms are, but 'cap out' at times, and gets a bit static-y with the higher pitches or louder sounds. It could just be that I was playing it with the speakers turned up a little louder than I usually game at, but I rather doubt it. (Incidentally, the original game doesn't have this problem.) - They seem to have basically cut out the stick-based movement controls. No matter how much or how little you push the analog sticks, you're going to move at the same speed and walking/running is based on the B button and which one you set to the default. I can see this potentially causing problems for veterans of the game since the analog stick and the D-pad controlled slightly differently. Basically, the analog stick moves you in the direction you move it, while the D-pad will shift so that when, for example, you're in a hall that is laid out at an angle, just pressing up or down moves you up or down the hall at that angle, rather than requiring you to keep tapping left or right every now and again. I haven't played enough to see which they've defaulted to for all movement, now, but either way I foresee some messy accidents, particularly in areas like Cleyra's trunk where you sometimes need to tread carefully. - On the brighter side, when naming party members you get this beautiful splash image of the character's face (from the those that appear when the title screen is idle, for those familiar with the game) along with a short (spoiler-free, even if it means occasionally lying to you) bio for the character telling you their age, species, and so on. Which I did appreciate. - Again, the FMV cutscenes are gorgeous in their full resolution glory. - Also again, it's still a fantastic game at its heart. Far and away the best Final Fantasy game (and certainly one of the best RPGs - J or otherwise), and I will only concede to Final Fantasy VI as a contender. Even then, I'd only agree to disagree. (And I say this as someone who has played every non-MMO Final Fantasy through to XII, as well as dozens of other western and JRPGs from Persona to Planescape to Elder Scrolls.)"
"Great port of a great game. Of 100 nobles watching, 100 were impressed."
The music.
"While VII is my favourite game, period, IX is, I think, the best game in the series.  What impressed me most was how balanced they managed to make all the characters through their retrospective arcs in the story, as it forces you to play with each of them sufficiently, rather than relying on only your favourites (a la VII) or ways of boosting their stats (a la VIII)."
"There are three types of games from your childhood;   * Games you played for nostalgia reasons only to find out they don't live up to the hype you remembered them from * Games from your childhood that were bad then and are bad now * Games that were absolutely amazing then your were a child and lived up to the remembere hype   Nowadays with the ever growing gaming industry, stories dvelop, graphics get ever more beautiful and general gameplay is improved, you play games from your childhood and the humour is often cheesy, the graphics are sometines dull and the gameplay outdated, Final Fantasy IX is an execption. 50% of games are bad then and bad now, 49% were good then and bad now in comparison, FFIX is the 1%! The memory is there, playing as Zidane a well developed character is fantastic! Re-Meeting Vivi and Garnet and the others was SUCH an amazing feeling, it's less playing a game from your childhood and more reuniting with some childhood friends, telling stories from your childhood and just being a kid yourself again! FFIX was and is a big part of my childhood that I'm MORE than happy to bring into my adulthood! This is a game you cannot put a price on because, it's not just moving pixels and a fantastic soundtrack! It's a long lost friend, and a friendship recommitted!"
"Final Fantasy IX is like a childhood friend of mine I'm meeting again for the first time in over a decade. Among the cheerful memories, witty banter, romance, moments of doubt and lessons-learned... it opened up a world of intrigue and steampunk-sprinkled adventure to my 13-year-old self during a time in which the world had me jaded. The game especially held a dear place within me as I introduced it to my childhood best friend. Raised in a religious household, she never grew up with the television shows and general entertainment that most millennials growing up in the west were able to consume. After we played through the riveting kidnap and crash sequence, I could see in her eyes a new world of possibilities had emerged. Not too long afterward she had somehow obtained a PlayStation and a copy of the game, which she and her little sister would soon complete. I noticed from afar that it had colored her life, and her little sister's as well. That friend of mine left this world two years ago, losing a hard battle to cancer. Her little sister lost her life in a car accident just prior. It was devastating that they had gone and yet I would remain. And now Final Fantasy IX has returned like a ghost of the fond memories we had shared in our distant past.  Final Fantasy IX was released in 2000 for the PlayStation. Until 2016, there was no legitimate way of playing the game outside of PSN in the west. This re-release will open the game up to many who have never had the chance to play it. This absolutely excites me. Final Fantasy IX was my first Final Fantasy game. I have since played them all, but Final Fantasy IX still remains my favorite. From the setting, to the differed ideologies of its characters, to the clever dialogue and story with its well-executed character development, and Nobuo Uematsu's brilliant, beautiful music which tied the story and its varied settings together. Also, it arguably had the sharpest and most-unique graphics among the PlayStation-era Final Fantasy games. I held to this being my favorite in many conversations, and until recently, had been the only one I knew standing behind it. Most people I talked to would just laughed at the mere mention of IX, usually citing the character designs as the reason they never gave it a chance. It is by far the most underrated of the PlayStation-era FFs, and I'm curious to see if this will remain to be the case going forward.  This is a great port of the game. The character models and textures are highly improved, although as I write this so close to the Steam release date, many gamers are currently complaining about the pre-rendered background textures. I never expected SquareEnix to go back to the source files and re-render those CGI files for the modern-era. I'm not even sure if they have access to them, or are still able to open them with a program. If they could somehow do that, perhaps they'd even be able to re-render the 4:3 aspect ratio cutscenes into 16:9, but I'm just happy they were even able to improve the in-game 3D models, textures, and text -- although I could imagine a portion of the original players expressing some gripe toward the latter.  Some would attribute these high-praises from original players to nostalgia-glasses. I'm here to say that I actually have a bigger appreciation for this game as an adult having a go at it again. So if you haven't given this game a try, what are you waiting for?"
"This game goes down as my all time favourite in the Final Fantasy franchise.  Most were not convinced of the models used or the look of the game (at the time), but Final Fantasy XIII proved that a game can look good but if it has the personality of a potato then what's the point?  The story is brilliant and the characters are by far better than most of the other characters in other Final Fantasy games, I'd go as far as saying that this game probably has some of the best characters in FF history!   As far as this port goes it's one of the best so far from the old school FF games, being keyboard and mouse friendly was a big surprise, and the way you can navigating through the menus without having to use a controller makes selecting items and organising set-ups so much quicker!  The models have been remade and look so much better than the PS1 versions, unfortuantly however the backgrounds do stand out as they were pre-rendered so there wasn't much they could do about that, other than redesign the game.  The cutscenes have been remastered are a lot smoother and look brilliant for a game that is 17 years old!   Other than that the game itself is flawless in the world of FF and a must have for any JRPG lovers! The characters are brilliant, the gameplay is excellent and the story told is always interesting.    I can't recommend this game any higher, and the only bad thing I can say about this game was the fact it destoryed my education at school back in the day, but I'll never forget those sleepless nights at 4am on a school day!"
Had this back when it first released then loaned it to a friend never to get it back again. Finally got to finish it again and my god do I still love it as over a decade ago. Definitely one of my favorite Final Fantasies
"One of the best JRPGs out there, and certainly one of the most underrated Final Fantasy games. Following it's 2 modern/future based predecessors, this title goes back to a more traditional fantasy setting. The important characters are fleshed out well and the story is very rich and quite original. Nobuo Uematsu is the music director behind the sound track so not much more needs to be said about that. The steam version of this game did spruce up the graphics most notably the character models. They are much more clean and well...visible in this version. All and all an excellent tribute to the original which was already a fantastic game.  10/10 Would play again..."
"When I was a little 13 year old kid in middle school, a friend of mine told me and my best friend about Final Fantasy IX and he let us borrow it and we fell in love with it, I STILL have my old PS1 save from that day eventhough I don't have the system anymore. soon after we beat the game our friend Chris, the one who introduced us to the game moved away and took Final Fantasy IX with him. we tried to look for it in stores could not find it as, this was back in the day when it was a rare game to find now. 18 years, later and we get this chance to play it again in re-mastered, re-rendered glory  this is a powerhouse of a classic.  and to you lazy gamers out there, this goes out to you!, they are cheats so you can Shut off random incounters, max out all damage and levels and get unlimited gil  just trust me, buy this game!"
"This will be about the port itself and I'll update it later with my thoughts on game  Final Fantasy 9 on pc is like Final Fantasy 7 remake. I never thought it would happen.  It is clear Square Enix have learned from past ports because this is how a HD port of a classic game should be done.  HD FMVs, backgrounds, models, new UI  The controller has reportly had issues with some people and I do hope Square Enix does fix it  there are other *issues* like UI being too big but I feel they are nitpicks.  This is one of the best jrpg ports that have came to pc and I hope to see more. Because there is a audience for these games on the pc platfdorm"
"Out of all the Final Fantasy PC ports I've played so far, this one has been the most carefuly handled. Wonderful, wonderful entry in the Final Fantasy series. This is probably my favorite next to XII and VI. Besides returning to the high fantasy setting of the early six entries, the game also fixes a problem with both VII and VIII- the equipment. Great characters, engaging story, and challenging turn-based combat in an adventure that lasts for many fun hours."
"This game is good as hell. Its very unique and beautiful, in my opinion the monsters of FFIX are the best.  +Unique +Good combat system +Story Rich +Immersive experience +Well designed monster and bosses +Very well done characters +Moogles  -Dont have an HP bar in combat (slrsy?). -If you dont have a chocobo, you will find combat every SECOND. -Chocobo minigame (H&amp;C) is the CORE of the game, if you want to become strong and kill more difficult bosses, you NEED to play this minigame. -Laggy world map (when you walk in the continents).  Cons are annoying but are acceptable. Final rate: 9/10"
"Played through this game on the PS1 a long time ago.  Right now I am still playing through the STEAM version and so far I am impressed. This is probably the best classic port of Final Fantasy that SquareEnix (or SquareSoft) managed to make. They have upgraded the 3d models to make them look clearer on HD and at the same time maintained their original authenticity. Backgrounds are also better but not as much and that is understandable since the game was made in the 90s and HD did not even exist. I have not seen any bug or performance issue and my xbox controller worked nicely. However, some people did have issues with connecting a controller and I am not sure if Square have addressed these issues officially or not.  In term of gameplay and story of this game, it is an excellent Final Fantasy game and the last one which involved most of the original Final Fantasy developers. It is also the last Final Fantasy (excluding the MMO ones) that have High Fantasy elements just like the original first games of the series. The game is strongly recommended if you are a fan or JRPG or the classic FF games."

Nothing better came out of Square Enix since they released that game in 2000.   And now this: an excellent port of an excellent game.   10/10 will do another encore to impress the nobles.
"I just got this game on Steam. I used to play it a lot on my PS1, and afterwards I also got it for PSP and PS3. Hell, even my account name is based on Final Fantasy 9. I've got to say that I'm really satisfied with this PC version. I got so happy to see the game I love the most to have new textures, fixed translation, a more refined art, and possible to please the 100 nobles at the duel at the start of the game (it took me several hours trying in the PS1 version, it was kinda frustrating, I didn't even knew what I was doing anymore). I look forward to the rest of the game. But from what I have seen so far, I bet it'll be like the magical experience it was for me back when I first played it. 10/10."
"I have to hand it to square and whoever handled this port. It's done beautifully and makes the game so much better.   I love the fast foward and no-random-encounters buttons. I know this could be considered technically cheating, but the ability to occasionaly speed through very slow parts of the game allow me to enjoy the game more as a whole (which is especially useful when I only have an hour to play).  There's additional buttons to max out your damage and skill levels, which I avoid completely as this would just ruin the game and make it boring.  They updated UI, textures, and models give this game a decent facelift. This was the only Final fantasy I never played through and I'm loving it so far."
"The most underrated FF of all time. This game captures the essence of what the series means more than any other entry. It was specifically created as a love letter to Final Fantasy fans at the end of the PS1 era.   While I haven't got incredibly deep into this pc port of it, I have played enough to evaluate the quality of the remaster. FIrst of all the character sprites are crisp, pretty and rekindle the magic of this world and its colorful cast. The backgrounds look a little bit bland, but I got over that pretty quick with these gorgeous character models in play.  The problem with these PS1 to PC ports from Square has always been the audio translation. Both FF7 and 8 had terribly muddy soundtracks on the remaster. With sound design being so crucial to these games, I found them unplayable until audio mods.  When I heard that remastered/modded audio was not possible for this FF9 port (due to the originals being lost) I cringed and thought it might ruin the experience. Fortunately, while we arent talking HD amazing sounds here, it somehow doesnt seem quite so bad as the previous entries.   I can't wait to get more time to stroll down memory lane with this game."
"The game was delayed multiple times(I know, they didn't set a proper date :P) which angers a lot of fans since they really want to get back to nostalgic days of playing one of the best Classic game from the Playstation. There were quite a lot of improvements though it seems some people hated the Borderline that was added and wanted widescreen but kinda defeats the purpose of bringing back the Nostalgic days.  I don't really see much problem about the price and people complain it being a mobile port when it doesn't as I don't see how it's different from the PsP/Console version besides all the HD Texture models, sounds and FMV. Even the file size is completely different. So I'm guessing its the minority people who really didn't go full research. Sure there is a FPS lock but this was created during the Playstation 1 Era and its not really easy to code the entire game to fit its FPS. You can turn on the highspeed mode with the F1 if you read the manual. There are cheats there though best not to use them unless you wish to speedrun or just to kill time. Game supports both Gamepad Control (It uses Japan Standard Layout) and has a perfect Keyboard+Mouse settings. The UI is kinda big and gets in the way at time.  Only the Main characters get a Remodel Texture while the rest didn't get the same Treatment. With the background it didn't see to fit also.  The sounds is also beautiful. Its not the Digital sounds that we all know as its replaced with actual musical instruments. Bugs, I've yet to even encounter any of them. I guess it differs to peoples PC/Laptop setup so if you have any problems go check the Discussion Forums since people have reported missing sounds or some sort of broken controls. Overall the port is perfect and there is no DRM which is a bonus."
"This game goes by Final Fantasy IX, but a more accurate title is Vivi Friendship Simulator to be honest. Because let's be real, that's how you really win at this game, befriending Vivi and making him happy. 10 / 10 would comfort little black mage child having an existential crisis about his meaning in the universe again."
Holy ♥♥♥♥ square enix actually put out a decent PC port for once.
"For anyone age 25+ this is what final fantasy used to be about: airships,chocobos,knights,thieves,princesses,crystalls and magic. Another great thing with this game is how it brings back the 'jobs/classes' and in this game, you can tell. You have Zidane the thief, who can obviously steal. You have the tanky and hard hitting knight Steiner. The white mage and healer Garnet, and the Black Mage, vivi, who can use elemental magic to damage enemies. And there is more classes and characters you meet in the adventure like for exemple a Ninja, a Summoner, and one of my favorite: the classic Dragoon etc.   This game is a real homage to the classics like FF4 and 6.   9.5/10 game. story wise, and character wise, this game just have a happy feeling around it, which FF7 and 8 lacked- this game didnt take itself too serious either and there are some funny scenes and jokes in it.    the graphic in this port is really nice, honestly. and the UI is 'fine' (... I didnt like it but it doesnt bother me at all tbh)  Anyway, anyone who is into fantasy,rpg's and medieval settings should get this- not even just the jrpg's fans."
"I so happy. This is the greatest game ever created. Do not argue with me on this, because I'm extremely biased and you'll convince me of nothing. FFIX's only flaw is that Zidane isn't in a million games like Cloud is. Get on that, Square Enix!"
"THE GAME:  One of my favorite JRPGs of all time. After the high tech themes of FF7 and FF8, Squaresoft went back to roots with a more traditional setting with boat airships, knights, and mages. The characters are all very well done with unique personalities that play and clash wonderfully with each other. The story starts out with a simple abduction of a princess, but eventually turns into a story about life and death itself.   THE PORT:  They did a good job of porting this to PC. The default keyboard controls are bizarre but can be rebound in the config menu. I would still recommend using a gamepad though. The main characters have been given a higher poly makeover without looking bad or tacky. The cinematics have been given some love and been made sharper. I'm not sure how they did that but I wish FF7 and FF8 had been given the same treatment. All in all, you'd never even know this was a mobile port if no one told you."
Major recommendation: The oldschool upgrade. Minor disappointment: World Map seems laggy because of fixed 20FPS (When you're trying to do a full screen points of interest selection)
"All is wonderful, but except 'Let the Bodies Hit the Floor III' achievement. Thank you, Square Enix!"
"One of my favourite Final Fantasy games finally on PC. Been waiting for this for a long time. And the extras, such as speed boost, bring it a bit more up to date making it a bit less of a chore in the slow battles."
CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK  -10/10
I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THE FAST FORWARD FEATURE  I LOVE EVERYTHING IN THIS NEW REMASTER I EVEN FORGIVE THE BLURRY ORIGINAL BACKGROUNDS BECAUSE OF THE NEW FEATURES THAT LET YOU CONCENTRATE ON THE AMAZING AND RICH STORY! IT'S BEEN 16 YEARS AND I'D STILL BANG THIS GAME 10/10
"never bored of this game, always enjoy the storyline and the movie.. remember at year 2000 i still played though and only until disk 3.. right now i can play all time i can i want :) thanks steam and SE to bring this game back to surface again after all this time."
"FFIX was my first FF game, and from the moment I played it in my PS1, I just fell in love.  This game has incredible gameplay, sounds, scenaries. It's a must-have for all FF fans, because it's a masterpiece.  I don't have to tell much about this game, cuz those who played it before knows how good this game is. If you're a fan of FF and didn't play it, just buy it. You won't regret. Now we can enjoy it with better graphics *-* 10/10"
WOW! Way to go! THAT is how you make a good re-release/port. It's easy on the eye and the controls are the same as the playstation version. You don't feel like it was also a port for iOS and Android with annoying ''touch'' menus (see FF3 and 5 and 6). It's as if I'm playing a whole new game with the feeling of nostalgia from the PSone era. Good job!
"Worth every penny, had no issues with the port ran flawless. Looks stunning for an old game, I would recommend finding the audio fix as without it the playback can sound compressed."
This Is My ALL TIME FAVORITE FINAL FANTASY GAME!!!!!! ABOUT TIME STEAM!!!!!!!!
"You need this game, Kupo! It is better than kupo nut, Kupo!"
what a nostalgic game.. one of the best final fantasy series game
Prepare for a ticket to your childhood. You won't regret it.
"Such a lovely game &lt;3 I enjoyed it on PS1 &amp; PS3 - though I never got a chance to fully complete it. I am so grateful to Steam for releasing Final Fantasy IX once again !_!  I also enjoy playing the card game 'Tetra' (I think it's called?) in game too. I try so hard to collect all cards, at least back in the day PS1 days, I was quite good at it. Can't say the same now though...  All I need to see is that someday, soon, Steam will release Final Fantasy 12 and I'd be living the dream .^_^."
"This was my first Final Fantasy I ever played when I got my first Play Station. This game became my favorite, no matter how many other games I play, this one will always stay as my favorite. I do like the rest but this one, will always stay in my heart.  The game runs perfectly, the graphics are the same, the only exception are the character's sprite. They updated them and you can see how they look completely different to the environment. Not taking that in mind, it's perfect. When I bought it in the settings, you have three options, to max your guils, max level and max the skills from the gear you get.  I find this good for people who just want to rush and revive the story once again or just grind the end of the game. For the rest of the people who wants to do it as we always did it, you can just ignore those options, but beware, if you turn them on once, you will have to start a new game, you can't reverse them.  Pros: -The music (God, I love it). -The cinematics.  -The story. -The characters. -How many things you can do. -You can use your mouse and click to move or just use a controller.  Cons: -They updated the character's sprite so it looks a bit weird. -Can't find any other bad thing about this fantastic game."
"One of the greatest JRPG experiences out there. In fact, probably one of the best stories out there in general. This is by far my absolute favorite game ever made. I played it at least 11 times through on my PS1 as a kid, and this port on Steam was not only solid, but (unsurprisingly) also brought me along for one of the best nostalgia trips I've ever had. This game STILL makes me cry, and even after just now completing it again for the 12th time, I STILL wouldn't mind playing it again. It's because this game is built on two major things that so many games lack, and that's VISION and HEART. FFIX is filled with interesting character designs, environments, side-quests, and overall story. It's very light hearted and really stresses the theme of the strength built through working together with friends. If you like Final Fantasy games or turn-based RPGs and haven't played this before, please please PLEASE give this game a try. You will fall in love with the characters and with how diverse, fun, and epic the worlds of Gaia and Terra are."
"Arguably one of the best Final Fantasy games to date! This revamp does a great job of bringing this PS1 title to PC, and keeps the game very close to the original. The turn base mechanisms in the game is awesome, and it also has amazing music, characters, story and dialogue.  9/9"
"Buy it. It's everything you knew and loved about FFIX.  Minor gripes (VERY MINOR, you should still buy this!): Some sounds are slightly incorrect (Freya jumping, Trance sound is slightly distorted, various other minor items) Cheats can be accidently activated (Instant trance, 9999 damage) when using keyboard. 30fps makes me cry."

"There is no ifs or buts. For me this is the best game I've ever played From the bottom of my heart, thank you for not only bringing it to PC but for making it magical again!!! If you're a JRPG fan it's a must play, but don't just play it. Experience it! The gorgeous updated graphics, the charismatic characters that tug on your heart strings, the memorable and engaging storyline and the soundtrack that will stay with you forever! This is one of the most complete JRPG experiences you will ever have! Thank you so very much for making me relive my childhood all over again and experiencing all the same heartfelt emotions and love that I have for gaming in general  It won't be long until I not just play it, but experience this heartfelt and beautifully perfect game (for me) all over again 11/10  For the people that never grew up with a PS1 or played FF9 I still think this game is well worth it if you're a JRPG fan. The button layout for the most part works very well on a keyboard, it's only a challenge early on during the minigame to impress the crowd and Queen Brahne. If you succeed there's a nice achievement to unlock as well. The game starts off with the Main character Zidane travelling with Tantalus to the castle of Alexandria to kidnap Princess Garnet while performing the play I Want to be Your Canary. This introduction introduces us to some of the characters nicely and helps you form a bond with them early on. It's also a nice introduction to combat which flows in real time. There is a bar in the combat box that fills over time and once full you can make selection into what attack you make to defeat your enemy. There is also the Trance meter that fills overtime and once full your character will enter the state of trance for a number of turns. Trance gives you different abilities and improved strength for your characters  Defeating enemies rewards you with experience points to level up your characters, AP (Ability Points) to help your characters learn new ablilties that are obtainable from different equipment for your characters and Gil (Currency) to spend on items and equipment.  The environments are very varied and beautiful. From the beautiful architecture of Alexandria and Lindblum Grand Castle to war torn Burmecia to the stunning Cleyra. Every destination is a treat for the eyes and makes you feel like the developers put there heart and soul into every brick and flower to really draw you into the game.   The characters themselves (Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, Steiner, Freya, Quina, Eiko and Amarant) are very varied in personality but compliment each other very well. By the end of the game they feel like family to me such was the connection I had for them. Even all side characters and NPC's are very interesting and have something important to say. I always wanted to go up engage them in conversation and often had a smile on my face whilst doing it.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in gaming, the intro music makes me feel like I'm about to play something special and every destination has a catchy and memorable tune that I often find myself humming along while I'm doing other activities. If your interested look up on youtube 'Relaxing Final Fantasy IX Music' and give your ears a treat into some of the music you can expect from the game  The story is very engaging and draws you in right from the very the moment Zidane lights the candle to provide light in the main area of the ship. You will go on an emotional journey with them, finding out where the came from, where the are going, what they are doing and why they're doing it. I don't wanna give away any spoilers cause it really is the main drawing point of the game and will keep you coming back again and again.  Overall if you love JRPG's, love memorable characters, simple but challenging combat, engaging heart felt story, gorgeous environments and a great soundtrack that sticks with you this is a game I highly recommend you play. If you're experienced in the genre this game combat wise will be quite easy for you but if your new to the JRPG genre this is an amazing introduction just like it was for myself 15 years ago. (There's plenty more to discover but I want it to be a nice surprise for you when you discover it)"
Best Final Fantasy of the Playstation era. A beautiful return to it's roots.
One of the best games in one of the best series And there's also the benefit of the PC port not being ♥♥♥♥
"Improved character models are much improved, but it appears to be a port of the iOS/Android version. This isn't an issue as far as I'm concerned, but the initial surprise at the UI changes faded quickly. I'm not sure what to think about the easymode boosts, but if you're looking to get through the game quickly, then I can see why you might want to utilize them.   The boosts also make sense in the case of much younger players with a low frustration threshold, or players that just want to feel like gods amongst the rabble. I played and beat this game on the original Playstation in years gone by, and more recently played the same version on my Vita so I could brush up on what the game was like before I picked it up here in order to write this review.   I streamed the game earlier today, and I'll be preparing an ADHD Gamer segment for it on my channel once I've finished it on PC. In the meantime, here's the first part of my playthrough, some two and a half hours of me commenting on the game and carrying on a conversation with the chat denizens.           YouTube™ Video:  SquirrelPlay: Final Fantasy IX&nbsp;"
"There are plenty of reviews about the amazing game and the gameplay and the soundtrack and so forth. I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I liked the new features ;) I originally played this game what seems like forever ago when it first came out and I was in high school. It was, and remains, one of my favorite video games, and possibly (probably) my favorite in the FF series. So of course, I was stoked for the HD release. However, I'm an adult now, and between continuing my education, my job, and my family, I just don't have the time to devote to games that I used to. My pile of shame bears testament. So I booted up for the first time, fully planning on doing an authentic play through, just like back in the days of old. No walkthroughs, no cheats, just me and the game. It started off fine, but about 12 or 13 hours in, I found myself spending less and less of my precious free time playing this game. Because when I did have time to play, I would either be getting my ♥♥♥ kicked because I didn't have time to grind/ suss out all of the little secrets and hidden treasure chests and sidequests, or I would grind for 20 min, then have to quit for the night until the next time I had a chance to grind for another 20 min. I got old, quick. So then I finally leveled enough to go to the next area, and I spent my entire play session tryin to get there and not making any story progress because of random encounters. So the next time, I turned them off, just for a little while. Soon enough, I found myself with random encounters turned off, my gil maxed out, 9999 attacks, lvl 99, all skills automatically mastered. And you know what, I was enjoying myself. I'm basically just cruising through the game in cinematic mode at this point, and considering I bought this game for a nostalgia trip more than anything else, it was perfect. Still is, in fact, as I near the end of disc 3 on the original. 5/5, would cheat again.  TL;DR: The 'cheat' options are great if you have limited playtime and just want a trip down memory lane."
"The best Final Fantasy, finally on Steam."
"[Updated review: included assessment of the port] This game holds a special place in my heart. I’ve played it hundreds of hours, and have now bought it three times.  This was released on the PlayStation (one) several months after the PlayStation2 had already been released. This was probably why it managed to slip under the radar for many folks, even though the graphics were on par with the PS2’s titles at that time.  This game harkens back to the NES and SNES world-types, and was the last game composed entirely by Nobuo Uematsu – the brilliant mind behind Final Fantasy’s genre defining music.  The truth is, the characters are all stereotypically cliché, and the plot is formulaic – but the world is so immersive and the storytelling so charming that this fails to detract from the experience. It’s fluff, not Machiavelli; it’s meant to be enjoyed. It overcomes the sitcom-like positioning of its set-pieces and embarks the player on a delightful experience, full of drama, pathos, and a fair number of laughs. If that’s not something you find desirable in a game, I suggest you look elsewhere – otherwise I can’t recommend it enough.  ----------  That’s all well and good, but how well does the port run?  Better than the original, honestly. I’ll address the cons in a moment, but they got everything as good as I could have hoped. Comparing both to the original PS game and optimum emulator settings, the game is so much crisper than it’s ever been. Previous aliasing miss-alignment are gone entirely, and the image fidelity is exactly what you’d expect from your computer’s hardware (again, qualifying these statements below). The UI has been updated, others attribute it to the mobile port which I haven’t played, but I’m inclined to say it’s a marked upgrade, even if it takes up additional screen space. I’m going to pick it apart in a moment, but with everything I’m about to say taken into account, I don’t really see how it could have done better.  That’s a hell of a statement, and you may be disinclined to agree with me in light of some other reviews, or even if you’ve played the game. And you’re right, you see graphical flaws, the textures are fair-to-poor in many places, the framerate is capped to about 30fps, and it’s pillarboxed.  Yes, these are issues this port has, and it’s understandable if they detract from your experience playing the game, but as I said: because they’re using the original game assets, it’s as good as it’s going to get.  “What!?” – Let me tell you about how they made this game 16 years ago. The majority of the game (except for cut scenes, world map, and battle arenas) are all sprites, not rendered scenes with hundreds of polygons. FFVII and FFVIII used actively rendered scenes, this is true – but for FFIX they took a completely different visual style. They pre-rendered all the landscapes and “baked’ them into a dozen or so polygons – significantly lessening the processing necessary, instead opting for a much higher level of detail than the previous two titles were able to achieve. The thing is, many gamers today would prefer active rendering because it’s become the norm, and that the resolution of the textures are very lacking by today’s standards.  Because of this, you get the reasoning behind the biggest complaints folks seem to be having in the reviews: The game is pillarboxed to 4:3 because that was the stock aspect ratio of all CRT screens used 16 years ago – they can’t just extend the camera to 16:9 like they did for the FFVII and FFVIII ports because the game’s assets were finalized into 4:3 images.  Secondly, along with the 4:3 target aspect ratio,  standard-definition  [en.wikipedia.org]  PAL televisions only had a max resolution of 720 x 576 (NTSC TVs in the US were a little smaller). This is why the textures are at the low resolution you’re seeing. If they made the game with higher quality textures, you’d never (ever) see a quality change on your standard-definition television. Personally I can’t blame Square for not having the foresight of knowing they’d be re-releasing the game into 1080p 16 years later. I’m just glad they didn’t emulate interlacing like you need to if you’re emulating the game on the PC.  The framerate cap is understandable, if undesirable. I’m not sure the reason, but the game runs dependent on a fixed update, not per cycle of your processor. 30fps was likely chosen because the original framerate was either 24, 25, or 30fps per SDTV. While HDTV is frequently 60fps, they likely used the age-old doubling  jitter-reducing  [en.wikipedia.org]  trick to match current monitor refresh-rates. (It’s not particularly necessary to understand what this means). The odd thing about this is that it is a solid framerate cap – I attempted to insert a speed-hack modifier into the game’s memory, only to have it crash every time (I wanted to use this as a frame-skip feature present in emulators). The game doesn’t hang when loading new scenes like the original did, so I suppose I’ll take that as an acceptable improvement.  The only other thing to talk about are the changes made to the UI. All-in-all I think it’s a large improvement, the only detraction being the increased size to accommodate mobile users. Everything about the menus, including the portraits, are much (much) sharper than they were in the original. If anything it’s too much of an improvement because it’s so much of a contract from the rest of the game. It does leave me to wonder that if they made such improvements to the UI, they could have adapted it to be a little more efficient with screen-space for the PC port. The additional features (infinite money, max level, etc. cheats) are in an out-of-the way place that are kind of hard to find, but they weren’t in the original, so I’m not sure where else they should have been put.  So, after all that, I can certainly recommend the game – both the core game and the port."
"JUST finished the game, so the emotions are strong, but I'll try to keep this short as possible.  Sound : 7/10 [Not always memorable music, but those that are are great. Otherwise standard sounds you would expect to hear in a Final Fantasy]  Characters : 9/10 [The beauty of FF9 is that, at least to me, the cast seemed bigger than the main roles. I genuinely wanted to know what happens to more minor characters as well, and they offered quite a bit of resolution for them]  Story : 8/10 [The story doesn't let up often. There are even points at which something can be predictable (Especially something i assumed in the ending) and yet even though I predicted these things, watching them unfold like they did still brought a tear to my eye in the end to see.]  Visuals : 7/10 [I mean, of course it's been improved than it was back in the day. Visuals won't exactly blow you away, but considering the limitations it is a very pretty Final Fantasy]  World : 8/10 [The world of Gaia is very diverse, and seems larger than the map leads on. There is a race for everyone to connect to, in one way or another.]   Overall : 39/50 FF9 did a good job of trying to return to the roots of the Final Fantasy series. It's nice to fight with 4 party members instead of 3 again. There are quite a few mini games that can further your game, as per usual. Admittedly, though i felt emotionally drained by the resolution, I wasn't as connected in some parts as they expect you to be [Judging by the gravity of the situation]. All in all, I would rate this a 'B+'. Not their best, but good enough to be right up there with some of those most consider great. Definietly worth a playthrough at $20 [The price as of now], and a must-buy if ever on sale."
"Let me start off by saying, WOW at how they cleaned this game up. The characters move very smoothly and the clarity is unreal. I can actually see the details in weapons that I never knew were there in the old Playstation version. Everything is very much up scaled. I'm kinda bummed Square Enix didn't remaster the music too (it's amazing to begin with though) but this isn't a full on remaster so it's whatever.   Thus far, my only gripe(s) is that sometimes the frame rate craps out only slightly because they up scaled the characters so much that the back ground gets a little constipated. Like when you take control of Vivi and the camera zooms in with 'Alexandria' fading in and out of the screen. Then when he gets knocked down by Puck... sweet baby jesus TEH blur. I also noticed it suffers from the same nonsense the other Final Fantasies when they're ported (to/from) andriod--the interface. The stupid battle menus look like the same cancer as before which perplexes me.... this was meant for PC but I feel like it being held back because of the port to android?  One last thing, no matter what screen ratio you choose or even if you full screen or window the game has this border on both sides that's distracting. I blame android. I feel this could have been SO MUCH MORE if they didn't bother with the android stuff and pushed for a PC release only. Just my opinion though.   ANYWHO! I'm grateful this was 'remastered' because it is my favorite Final Fantasy from the Playstation era. It's nice to see it at least cleaned up and easily accessible for me to play again. I love it for the nostagia factor yes, but I also love the game in no matter what format it's in. (Even if it's android....provided that if I didn't have a computer :p )"
"One of the best FF games is now available for PC with some enhancements and tweaks to make it run and look better. Stuff like controller support, achievements, trading cards and a no encounter toggle are a nice bonus."
What can I say? This is literally my childhood. Favorite game in the Final Fantasy franchise. Amazing.
Solid port. Plays pretty much exactly how I remember it back on the PS1. No BS additional account system to register and sign in with just to play like the FFVII port. The improved graphics are a nice touch.
"Final Fantasy IX was one of my favorite games as a kid. When I finally replaced my original copy that was stolen, I was disapointed to learn that the third disk would glitch out right at the beginning, and so I've never had the chance to complete it. I'm super stoked that I can finally finish it! It's the only FF game in the original series that I haven't beaten yet!"
"I played this game a long time ago, twice, but if I remember it right, it was not as memorable as the other classics such as FF 7 or 8. My friend gifted this game to me all of sudden, so I have an opportunity to replay it.   Back then my english was not as good as now. The emo heroes such as Cloud and Squall shaped the general jrpg heroes, the sudden introduction of Zidane deviated the popular tropes, it's probably the reason I didn't like FF IX back then. Perhaps because Final Fantasy VII was my first Final Fantasy entry (I only played three rpgs on SNES: Chrono Trigger, Mystic Quest, and Super Mario RPG. I played FF VI only after the re-release on PSX) therefore I couldn't understand why everyone praised FF IX, when actually this was a very refreshing entry on JRPG.   I have forgotten 80% of the plot, so this is almost like a new gameplay for me. Well, I gotta say this game is truly charming. The opening scene and the kidnapping of princess Garnet is probably one of the best opening I ever seen. It truly established the characters of the cast very well and you can tell the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. I really like it.  Now for the quality of the port itself. So far I think it's the better port of FF entry, the game is capped 30 fps which is just fine. The 3d graphic has been upscaled to HD version.   As this is a port of an old game, you will notice that the pre-rendered CG don't age very well. One of the main reason is that Square lost all the high-resolution arts (please read and cry)   http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=551612   the good thing, this game has also a built in cheat. 9999 damage for example. if you don't care about the gameplay and just want to enjoy the story (it also has a fast forward button). just activate the cheat. Be careful about the level 99 cheat though, it will only increase your level, not your status   This game is truly a classic. I think I can appreciate this game better than before."
"I've played this game several times over on the PS/PS2 and I still love it to this day. Definitely still my favorite Final Fantasy game out of the lot. Though I'm sure at least half of that is nostalgia glasses lol.   The port of this is pretty good, all of the up-res'd textures on the characters and monsters have me noticing details I never saw before. Like how Fangs aren't as horrifying as I thought they were because the green part is actually their ears and not their eyes and that white part is their muzzle and not a horror-mouth. It's a little jarring because the pre-rendered backgrounds are still the same quality as before, which is fine and understandable, but the difference is noticeable."
"This is the game that introduced me to the Final Fantasy series. Haven't played it in many, many years and it is a huge notalgia trip for me. Just a few pros and cons below:  Pros: -Obviously the updated character models and menu graphics, which look amazing.  -Haven't played it on a keyboard and mouse, but the controller setup plays just how I remember it on the PS1. (Had to switch two buttons around, but that's not a complaint.) -One of the best stories of any of the Final Fantasy games. -I like the fact that when you try to interact with an npc, that game brings up icons to let you know if they are a character that you can challenge to a card game.   Cons: -The controls bug out when I start the game with both the PC controls and controller active at the same time. (To be fair that might just be my computer.) -The 2D background look absolutely horrible. They are incredibly blurry and clash very obviously with the new high quality character models. Which is a shame, because I really enjoy the background visuals in this game."
"This is a fantastic game, and is easily one of the best entries in the entire Final Fantasy series (Take my word for it, I have been a longtime fan and have played nearly every entry in the series). Everything about this game is near perfect. The story is second-to-none and the character development is the best the series has seen since FF6, as you end up growing attached to (almost) every character by the end of the game. The music is spectacular, as was standard for Squaresoft in the 90's. The graphics have aged quite well and look great remastered in HD (especially the cutscenes). The only negative thing I can say about this game is that the graphics in the world map look fairly poor by today's standards... Oh, and there's Quina (worst FF character ever!!)... But it really isn't that big of a deal because everything else is so well done. If you like the Final Fantasy series (or turn-based JRPGs in general) and have not yet had the opportunity to play this, then you owe it to yourself to experience this absolute masterpiece in gaming. Hats off Squaresoft, you guys really nailed it with this one."
"My first Final Fantasy, ff9 is the most immersive Final Fantasy ever, if you can do with the old graphics. Even the fights are made to make you feel a part of this fantastic universe, big fun, an interesting story, and fair difficulty lvl."
"A lot of players reviewed good multiple aspects for this game, from story, graphics, and other things. I cannot disagree from most of positive reviews so I won't repeat those admirations..  I will review the game from the gameplay aspects, which is really surprising (beware of some spoilers). The PS1 version alone giving either a simple fight monsters, level up, and tackle bosses OR play with complex way with challenges (level 1, Excalibur 2, solo characters, speedrunning etc) which encouraging replay and game mechanic learning.   Those are still exist in Steam version but with achievement additions and few gameplay adjustments this game adds more spice when the food is already in good taste. Although some changes like different 100 nobles sword script and Quina's frog catch are just minor, they are noticable from old players on PS1 and make things more interesting (either easier to do or add good indicators for new players)...  The characters limitation for only learn specific skills is the one con for this game but it does not make the games bad. In fact, it makes a unique gameplay which probably not all FF games have it. You can still customize to make Zidane a tank via Defend+Protect Girls as example, or make him in 7 HP for high DPS via Lucky Seven. Farm Topaz to boost Garnet's Ifrit or use Concentrate to boost her Heal. Many options for you to play with equipments and abilities.  The game however, is still not perfect. Many good gameplay aspects, but it's sad they didn't fix some glitches or adjusted the monsters since this game has 4 monsters that you can't avoid EXP (otherwise full level 1 play is possible although you might want level up for end game bosses). Still it's a good game that you should play in different ways when you replay it...  So you can do many things in your game although most players just follow what the game offers for you while they hid many cool game mechanics if you learn them. I encourage you to do some challenges as replay if you already cleared the game..."
Nobuo Uematsu out did himself in this fantastic and beutiful game
Couldn't steal anything﻿...  Couldn't steal anything﻿...   Couldn't steal anything﻿...  11/10
"A smashing remake of a good game. The game itself remains largely unchanged, so don't worry if you are just looking to buy a PC port of the game, this is Final Fantasy IX as you knew it on the PlayStation. The graphics have been updated slightly to improve the overall visual appearance of the game, while maintaining the old artistic style the original edition had.   The boosters that come with the game are entirely optional but helpful if you aren't a fan of the battle system or just want to play the game for the story. They include boosting your Gil (in game currency) to the maximum amount, always dealing 9999 damage per attack (the maximum you can attack for), skipping random battles that are there for grinding purposes, maxing out your learning of skills, speeding up certain parts of the game (though I don't know what they specifically speed up) and remaining in Trance at all time (trance being a mode your character can enter to do more damage/more attacks) and I swear there was one more but I can't remember for the life of me.   The game is highly immersive with lovely looking locations, interesting characters whose story and personality is aided through the game's unique system of viewing little events they get up to and defiantly worth playing.  "
"I remember getting this game back on its release date back on the original Playstation and enjoying everything this game had to offer from the characters, the story, the setting, and the soundtrack. Everything about this game was memorable and it has always been in my top 3 favorite Final Fantasy games. Naturally I got excited when I heard about the game being released on Steam and I could barely wait to revisit this RPG classic. I'm overall very impressed with what they did for the Steam port, the character models have been beautifully updated and cinematics that normally caused slowdown on the Playstation port have been fixed and now flow very smoothly. This is a beautiful port and I highly reccomend it. Whether you're a returning player or a newcomer to the series, Final Fantasy 9 has something that everyone can enjoy. Buy the game and relive one of the greatest Final Fantasy games ever made."
"I loved this game when I was a child so I got really exited about the steam announcement to release a reworked version of the old classic. It was rather disappointing to wait this long for the release after they announced it for 'early 2016' but anyways, if the reason is that they needed more time to make it even better I don't care.   The game itself runs perfectly smooth and works the same way as expected from a console port that is done well. I can run it with my keyboard alone if I want to, which is nice, because my pad broke down..   Don't expect everything to be reworked because that is not the case. The character models and render movies are reworked, the world and most other things aren't. But that is to expected IMO.   They even let some little things slip through as an artifact of old times e.g. the old save screen where you can choose the 'memory slot' to be saved on. I really like these things!  I had zero bugs or crashes in my 13hrs of playtime so there is nothing to complain about really in this game.  the story and characters are things I would give 3 thumbs up if I could but I'm gonna be honest, I'm a bit of a biased enthusiast about final fantasy especially the parts 7+9. So just see for yourself if it can compete with modern titles. I myself think it can, but I just bought it to re-live this great experience I had when I was younger."
awesome port
If there was a game that summed up my childhood love for gaming it would be this one. If you are looking for a story telling master piece that breaks the 4th wall only to make fun of its own stereotypes then this should be your bread and butter. A game that I have put in hundred of hours into on the PS1 it proves time and time again to show you that there is still a place for heart warming story rich RPG's in the gaming industry.
"A surprisingly good port of a surprisingly fun game other than a few aspects, also the cheat button things are a bit overpowered and will take out some of the challenge in the game, good fun but can be tedious in some parts, also a few textures and a few unnecessary loading screens but what do you expect from a game made in 2000?  I'd still suggest it to some friends to play and it's a surprisingly good port other than some graphical issues which you can overlook.  It's an extremely fun and entertaining game and even if you aren't just playing for Nostalgia, it's a great game and really enjoyable, I basically went into this game not knowing a thing about it and I loved it. It's extremely well done and a very good port. I especially love the cutscenes in this game, they're ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful considering how old this game actually is and the story holds up really well, characters are all extremely memorable and I'll never forget some of the insane enemies you face in this game, as someone who'd never really played a Final Fantasy game before in my life, I'd suggest this game to anyone and everyone, it's thoroughly enjoyable and replayable and it's just all 'round fun alongside a really good story, well worth the money you spent on it.   The cutscenes are incredible, the game is amazingly fun and the enemies are absurdly memorable and insane, highly recommended to everyone. 10/10 - Tailed Humans everywhere."
"Before I even get started let me say that this is one of my favorite video games of all time, and is my favorite in the series, by far. So some things that I might be rough on, others may not have an issue with. I also, admittedly, overlooked one or two VERY minor things. I also want to note that this is rushed because, well, I didn't want to stop playing to post this.  Where do I even begin? Geez, there is so much in this port that is done flawlessly. This game is one of the very few that might actually be able to compete with Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete for my all time favorite game. (Okay, probably not, but it's just as amazing in its own way.)  The music: The music for this game has always been phenominal, and Square did a very nice job of porting it with the upgrades in quality. I've actually found myself just sitting here (even while writing this review) and listening to the gorgeous music playing. I can't stress enough how great this is. Music - 10/10.  Menus and Interface: They're all very nice looking, and very easy to navigate. There is even the option to change between the normal view, and the classic view, which is also done nicely. Personally I like the 'normal' view because I've always been a fan of a more neutral pallete for these things. That being said, not everyone may enjoy this and prefer the classic, but you've nothing to fear. Both have clearly had a lot of time put into them, and it shows. Menu and Interface - 10/10  Tetra Master - This may be the game's only weak point, but even so I had no real issues with it. There have been some very minor changes that make it more player friendly and make it that much easier to just get into. If that's not enough, there are also some guides on Steam, GameFAQs, etc., but I have to rate this as it is in the game alone. Tetra Master - 8/10  Graphics - This is usually one of the biggest problems with ports. Well, this and just crash issues (which I have not had happen once yet). To be honest, they look really good, but there seems to be some room for improvement. However, given what they look like, how they looked before, etc., they do a perfect job of keeping the charm of the original FF9. People that haven't played this before might find them lacking, but as a fan of the series, and of FF9 especially, I can't ignore how amazing of a job this does. Graphics - 9/10  Controls - Now, I am using a controller. Not because 'haha console scrub' but because of nostalgia. So while I can't speak of the controls on a KB/M for this, I can say that the controls on an actual controller feel totally flawless. I honestly can't find a single issue with them. If there was HALF as much effort put into KB/M as there was for a controller, it's a huge improvement over other FF ports. Controls - 10/10.  Story - This may be where the nostalgia kicks in. I absolutely LOVE the story of FF9. Every bit of it. No other game in the series (Except FF6) has provoked such a strong response out of me. I found 7 lackluster and cliche, I found X boring, X-2 was a fanservice. IX is amazing, at least to me. Now, I know not everyone will feel this way, but I think, as I always did, that it was done flawlessly. I adore the characters, especially the love story between two of the characters (I won't say who. Trying to keep it spoiler free). This is the EASIEST 10/10 that I have EVER given. Story - 10/10  Gameplay - Obviously this is what matters the most, and holy ♥♥♥♥ was it ever done so well? I don't think there has ever been a FF game that I could play through 5-6 times on PS1 and still love the gameplay. It's just gotten better on PC. This is one of the most fun games in the series to play, and it's also an amazing place to start. There is the class ATB with some amazing improvements that people who haven't played an earlier game but played X will even find enjoyable. I haven't found a single bug or glitch, and even those that I found in the original seem to have been fixed (Admittedly I miss some of them, but I am glad that they were fixed.) Gameplay - 10/10  So here we go. My overall score of Final Fantasy IX on PC.....  10/10 LEGENDARY! This game is a must own for any real RPG fan, not just those that are a fan of the FF series. It's a timeless classic and will make you feel emotions that no other game does quite as well (Except maybe Lunar 1/2 or FF6.)  Buy this game. Hell, buy this game twice and give a copy to a friend that has never played Final Fantasy. It's INCREDIBLE and deserves every last bit of praise that I can give it. Buy it. Now. Why are you reading this? Go buy it. Play it. You will not regret doing so.  Boosters? - Okay. I can't say that I use these, but they are there for anyone that wants to take the fun out of the game and make it overly easy. They do a good job of implementing these, but admittedly I don't like them there. However, I can't lower the scroe because of these, which is why there are added AFTER the actual review. They're a nice touch for people that want them, but I personally suggest staying away from them if it's your first time playing this classic.  Again, 10/10. Go buy it. It's worth every bit of the 21 USD at full price."
"Some good points and some bad points, it is clearly a mobile port, but it does support the controller quite well. The boosts are nice too, if you are really stuck or just need a quick hand with something. Or perhaps you just don't want to grind forever, it has a fast forward option for that, or no encounters, or anything else.  I will say the prerendered backgrounds are still their original resolution, and the letterboxing on my 16:9 display isn't exactly pleasant, but they put a little bit of artwork on teh sides of it.  You can rebind your controls, and it does work fine with keyboard and mouse, as there is no analog movement on the map in the first place.  The updated models clearly stand out on the not-so-updated backgrounds, but the music is just as good as ever. I reccomend getting this one if you don't have it already"
So I also have all the other Final Fantasy ports and baseing off the the FF7 and FF8 ports I think this is the best of the 3. I am a huge fan of the series and if you remember playing it back when it first came out you will love it. Graphics are impoved over the original game but its FF9! on the PC!  What I say if you enjoyed the original game expect that quality but on the PC. Yes the menus are a little clunky but that is because they are the same menus from the Mobile app... Controller work just fine I played with both my Steam Controller and my Steelseries Startus XL(prefer this one) and played like a Playstation game.
"This Final Fantasy embraces fans with memorable, dynamic characters. The battles are slower than other FFs, and level progression is slow in the beginning, but overall it's an FF game in the traditional vein. As per usual, the story takes a turn for left field around the 75% mark, but that's okay because the majority of primary sidequests open up then (and boy are there a lot of them), which you can explore without worrying too much about what's going on storywise. If you felt FF7 and 8 were too gritty and real, FF9 hits the fantasy sweet-spot that 4,5, and 6 built from the ground up. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of tragedy, but it manages the drama in a lighthearted way.   Bottom line: If you liked the old SNES era Final Fantasies, this one's for you."
Pros: They gave Beatrix Boob physics.  Cons: They gave *Beatrix* Boob physics.
one of the best final fantasy games.
"The character textures looks nice, and the game is as good as it has always been. Masterpiece from Square."
IT'S FINALLY OUT YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 10/10
I loved this game as a kid and im so happy that i can now play it on my computer.
"The best Final Fantasy game ever made. If you're lookinig into getting into Japanese RPGs, this is the game to play."
This is my favorite FF game without doubt and I'm so happy that it finally has been released on steam. I really appreciate the game boosters! For people like me who doesn't like to grind for hours they're perfect ^^
After more than 15 years and I keep on playing. :)

"One of the best JRPGs out there, theres not much to say without spoiling it so ill just say that I've played this for years and I still love it, get this game."
"Best Final Fantasy for me.  Love everything from it: characters, music, minigames.  Only drawback is that the combat is a bit slow than it should be"
"This is definitely my favourite game of all time. I believe I've beaten it seven or eight times in my life, and I'm sure I'll continue to play through it every now and again for the foreseeable future.   The Steam version is easily the best way to play, for a few reasons.   1) Fast forward. It works wonders for speeding up grinding/fast-forwarding through sections you already know.  2) The updated character models are jarring for the first little while: after that, though, I found that I liked the look of them more than their original, blurrier counterparts.  3) The price. It's a pretty good deal, and the convenience of Steam makes it so you aren't having to change discs or anything of the sort (though, admittedly, I miss switching discs for RPG's :( )  If there was one thing I wish they'd done, it would be finding those original background assets, and releasing them in HD. That would make this game go from 'pretty for a game from 2000' to 'holy ♥♥♥♥ this is breath-taking'.   All in all, while I'm still biased for this, this re-release gets my constant of 10/10 for FFIX. Play this, if you haven't. You'll be happy you did."
"Well, Final Fantasy IX portage on pc is probably a success but there are some things that I would like to see 'disable' from this game : - Press F1 F2 F3 and F4 during your game and you are just invincible I don't know what they putted it in the portage but I think It kills a bit the difficulty of this game.  Excepted this, the rest is a real pleasure to see/read/play  I did this game when I was young and see it on steam was an opportunity to me to know if I still love these games (FF saga) after more than 10 years. The answer is yes =)   About the price :  Well all Final Fantasy are bewteen 10€ and 20€ (if I'm right at the moment),It not really expensive but some of them like Type HD-0 are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game for the price. Final Fantasy IX is a good one and the price is ok for this game.  After all the gameplay with the keyboard is really difficult to remember witch touch do witch actions if you don't bind your keybord for you. With the controller too, easier to play but I think it miss some touch on the controller to translate keyboard actions for controller (I play with xbox controller)  After all, I'm happy to see this game on steam, and on computer, because I was waiting for it years and years."
"en  Final Fantasy IX is one of the first games I've ever played, and by far it is my favorite game. I've played it over and over again, and I do it again everytime I get the chance to do so. I remember when I had a PS1, I borrowed the FF's CD with my friend, he told me that I would probably deslike the game because only he's brother (that was older) played it and he didn't find it entertaining. I 'borrowed' (I still have it) nevertheless, and up to date (after 10 years later) I still go back just to play it.  Best game ever done 10/10  pt-br  Final Fantasy IX foi um dos primeiros jogos que eu joguei, e de longe é o meu jogo favorito. Já joguei ele incontáveis vezes, e sempre que tenho a oportunidade eu o faço novamente. Eu me lembro quando eu tinha o meu PS1, eu peguei emprestado o CD do FF com o meu amigo, ele me disse que eu provavelmente não iria gostar porque só o irmão dele (que era mais velho) jogava e ele não achava o jogo nada interessante. Eu peguei o jogo 'emprestado' (até hoje eu tenho ele em casa) mesmo assim, e até hoje (quase 10 anos depois) eu ainda volto para jogar ele  Melhor jogo já feito 10/10"

I have played this game lots of times before.  First time i played it on steam 15 hours.  Second time 10 hours.   Haven't played a third time... waiting for the next time I have 10+ hours free :p
"Loved the setting and the overall tale. This game has some of the best characters I've come across in any of the final fantasy titles (Only played 7, 10, 13, 13-2). Especially Vivi.  Only complaint would be the battle system, animations etc.. made me wait a long time while I already had a lot of commands stacked. It's nothing but a nitpick though. It's still enjoyable.  Would recommend :)"
"I've beat this game so many times on PS2 and I own every single final fantasy game many times over( except for the spin-offs), but I have to say this one is the best one. Great story, flavorful art style that trys to harken back to the original sprite proportions while trying to blend into 3d graphics.   THE MUSIC!   The equipment system makes you value all the loot and of course the elusive Excalibur II challenge, which I am btw doing as I type. i'm already 9 hours in and almost done with disk 3 portion. The bitter-sweet relationship I have with this challenge does not stop me from giving this game a 10/10.   If you have played this game, what are you waiting for?"
Well Well Well.. This is the closest thing to the TRUE FINAL FANTASY game you can play. Hopefully Square Enix will do a complete Remaster for this game. Imagine the Bahamut vs Alexander scene.. Gonna be epic.  Opps I forgotten this is the review section.  -Great Game -Great Port -Great Soundtrack -Great Battle System -Great Story -Great Characters -Great 40 hours of Nostalgia!!
"Time to review another Final Fantasy game... Again. And the same warning as last time.  WARNING: IF YOU ARE EXPECTING FINAL FANTASY XIII GRAPHICS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE IGNORED EVERYONE TELLING YOU, REPEATEDLY, THAT THIS IS A PORT OF THE ANDROID/IOS VERSION - WHICH IS A PORT OF A PS1 GAME FROM 16-17 YEARS AGO - DO_NOT_BUY, or at least don't complain. Why drop $16 on a game you know you'll just complain about?  Okay, so if you're expecting high-def backgrounds - don't. Look. This game was released in 2000/1999. Back then it looked spectacular, they DID put a lot of effort into it, and I'm almost 100% certain they never ever thought that they would be re-making this game. The models used for the pre-rendered areas no longer exist. Accept it. There's far more to the game, such as the story, dialogue, and music.  The character models, battle scenary, and menus? They're great. At times it looks the models are watercolor painted, and personally I like that. The menus and item icons are well-polished. The music is still the same music as before, maybe slightly higher audio quality - but that could be due to hardware, so don't take my word on that.  Some people are having controller issues, but my 360 controller seems fine. Your results may vary, but I'm 100% certain it'll be patched in the next couple days.  But I digress on the port issues. Let's delve into the meat of the game...  Final Fantasy IX is a return to the midieval roots of the series. This doesn't necessarily mean four crystals and yatta yatta. It's about people coming together, becoming friends, and overcoming evil. Characters hava pre-defined classes, but while there's no job system they're the classic Final Fantasy I-IV classes. Customization is plentiful through weapons, armor, and accessories. Music is memorable, and as it's stuck with me for 16 years at this point? I'm pretty sure it'll have a similar effect on you. The storyline has a good many twists to keep you interested. Personally some find the begining a bit long and boring, but I -promise- you that after you get out of the forest you'll be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the game. As fr the characters, some are hit-or-miss but I honestly feel like if you got attached to the characters in Undertale that you'll do the same for at least of the characters in this story.  If you're not new to the game, but are thinking of buying it for nostalgia? There are some nifty additions that'll help you beat the game more quickly without breaking the gameplay experience. So yes, for the nostalgia, $16 ($20 if you're reading this after the sale ends) is worth it."
"It's Final Fantasy IX. That's all you need to know to convince you to buy it. But I'll elaborate.  Pros:  + High definition character models + Revamped menu system + It's Final Fantasy IX!!! + Booster options (cheats) to make difficult sections more accessible to more players. + Mouse &amp; keyboard controls (though I still just use a gamepad) + Nostalgia  Cons:  - The world and environment hasn't been updated to high definition, but it would require all new artwork so I understand why."
this is how you do a re-release....  10/10
Everybody out there who wants to port your old game to new platforms without completely remaking it: THIS IS HOW YOU F****** DO IT!!!  *whistles Melodies of Life while leaving the room*
"Childhood memory; here I come.  *clear throats*   It is an undeniable fact that the essence of all RPG games falls down to the plot. Although many times the Final fantasy series have similar plots such as the protagonists being branded as outcasts, run around the world then at some point managed to save the day and concludes with a happy ending but it still never fails to captivate me. In addition, FFIX has very detailed characters where each character holds a very deep story of their own. Not to mention, all the characters are very likable. Like take for example animes, dramas, movies, novel and basically anything that is a story; there will always be that 1 irritating egg head character that stresses you to the point where you would go ‘JUST GET THE FUQ OFF ALREADY KUNT?!?!?’. But for some odd reasons these characters somehow someway get a lot of screen time... WHY? -.-‘ Nevertheless, FFIX has none :3 (maybe Steiner in the beginning I guess LOL).  Moving on, FFIX also has great music that comes along with it ( yea.. Garnet.. and her mellifluous voice [I think she was my first crush &gt;.&lt;]) I must say I absolutely adore her when she was singing the ‘Melodies of Life’. Then there’s also Beatrice. Her theme and her character without a doubt carries their charm too. Although there is also Freya and Eiko but since they are not as visually attractive.. I have decided to skip (Don’t judge me :P)   The graphics and gameplay matter little to me back then, they still matter little to me now. The fantasy FFIX brought me through remains beautiful. Highly recommended. V ^^  "
"it's like, pretty good, i guess."
"Often when you played game for 7 hours - you can tell something about story, gameplay and other stuff. What about me, I completed first mini game, that you can found on fourth screen in first 10 minutes."
"- Nostalgic Feeling = Check - A Huge Final Fantasy with a World Map = Check - The realisation that RPG's got nerfed out of how long they used to be since then :P - Hours and Hours of Random Fight and Upgrading Abilitys - Quite a nice conversion for such an old game. Playable with both controller or mouse and KB. - No Crash after 6-7 hours of gameplay = nice job devs! - Expectations are met.  Now, Mind if I do a J?"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this game! For being an older final fantasy, the story and even the stylized graphics are first rate, and didn't feel like its age. Each character is defined and has a role to play in the story and in the gameplay. I really liked the method for leveling characters abilities, which are tied to equipment. If you just play through the story, this game can b completed in a number of hours, but for those that want to delve in and get into the world of this game, there are hours and hours to additional content and side quests that you can do to enhance the story and level your characters. If you're looking for an immersive game to capture your imagination and interest, give this one a try!"
"I've been waiting for this day ever since one of my friends showed me back in January that this game was coming out for PC. My all time favorite Final Fantasy game and one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. I am so glad just like Final Fantasy VI remastered edition, you guys have out done yourself on bringing this game to a pc port. Everything I loved about this game back when it released in 2000, is here, and it makes me so happy to be replaying it again. I still own my PS1 copy but the PC version is so beautiful in HD resolution. I totally recommend this for all the classic Final Fantasy players and new players of RPG games all together. I will be going all out to get every achievement on this game, even that blasted Jump Rope one. It will be done."
"Let's get this out of the way: I am not here to sell you on Final Fantasy IX. But, in the sake of a complete review I will give my opinion of the game, itself. If you're reading this review, you probably have some interest in this title. If that is the case, then I suggest you play it. As plain as that.  Now, what I am really here to do is sell you on the Steam port of Final Fantasy IX. I have played the game on the original Playstation, and I have played the original version on both emulator and PSP. I have not played the mobile version, but it is essentially the same as this port without controller support. This version is, by far, the best way to play this game.  Let's start with the negatives: -One of the biggest complaints I've seen is that, while sprites and menus have been updated, backgrounds and other images in the game have not. This didn't bother me one bit. Yes, the HD assets do stand out against the old PS1 pre-rendered environments, but given Final Fantasy IX's cartoon-like art style, I don't think it looks bad at all. Your mileage may very. -Another big complaint I've seen is that the battle menu is so big. It can often cover-up the numbers that appear over the last two characters in the party when they're damaged/healed. This is obviously to cater to touch-screen for mobile, and a lot of people point out that they could have left the original menu in as an option for those who wanted it. It's a fair complaint, I think. -I have encountered a few bugs. Mostly involving the music cutting out momentarily or stuttering during scene transitions. It always corrects itself after a moment, but it did annoy me and break my immersion once or twice. They're a slight nuisance at worst.  -To activate the Toggle-able Boosts (No Encounters, Fast Forward, etc.) you have to pause the game and then press one of the 4 shoulder buttons if you're using a controller (permanent boosts are enabled in the config menu, and using a keyboard the toggles are F1-F4, just FYI.) First, there is no mention in the game that these boosts even exist, and there's no way I've found to change these contros. When I was first playing, I was unaware you could control the boosts this way, and I must have bumped one of them coming out of pause, (not noticing the visual indicator in the corner of the screen to show a boost is active) because the next fight all of my characters magically had full trance bars. Little heads up would be nice.  -Certain areas of the game that are meant to have low encounter rates seem to have MUCH lower encounter rates. At first, I thought it was a bug with Qi's marches. I didn't encounter an enemy in one until the end of the third disc. Having caught 99 frogs and defeated Quan I finally learned Frog Drop. I also didn't get a single random encounter while going through the Desert Palace. (And, no, the No Encounters boost was no on, I checked every time I paused) -No windowed full-screen mode. Probably my biggest complaint. There is a TON of stuff in this game, and a lot of it requires a guide. Having a guide up on one screen and playing on another means dealing with the game minimizing every time you click off of it, or running it in a window (yuck!)  Now, on to all of the good stuff: -Battles are faster. This, alone, makes this THE way to play Final Fantasy IX. The PS1 vsersion had notoriously slow ATB gauges. Being able to increase the battle speed is a Godsend. At max, there's virtually zero downtime between animations. -The new models and menus look fuh-reaking awe-some. Nothing seems to be changed at all, just HD-ified. Even with the backgrounds really showing their age, these changes breath some life into this sixteen-year-old title. -Skippable cinematics and a Fast-Forwad mode for whatever you can't skip. Do I need to explain why this is awesome? -No Encounters is great for when you have to revisit areas and you don't want to be bothered by low-level encounters. I wouldn't recommend leaving it on permanently unless you're using other boosters or going for fast times or low level or whatever.  -Speaking of the other boosters, they're there for those who want to use them. If you're looking to play through the story hassle-free or achievement hunting I could see them being useful. Maybe not trance every fight. That one is mostly just annoying.  -Aside from the issues outlined above, the game runs perfectly. Load times are virtually nonexistant, no slowdown anywhere. The requirements are very low. I don't see many people having a hard time running this. -AUTO-SAVE! Hallelujah, auto-save. Did you forget to equip Master Thief before the boss fight? Or maybe you just plain got K.O.'d. Don't want to start all the way back at the save point? No problem, just hit 'Continue' on the title screen and it takes you right back to your last screen transition. (Note: scenes that start right as you enter an area will automatically start when you continue this way, so in rare cases you may not be able to access the menu before a fight. This means you should still save often just in case you need to roll back a few screens.) Couple this with cinematic skips and fast-forward and you can get right back into the action.  -Controller support is fantastic. Feels just like the original, although you'll probably want to swap A and B if you're used to a western control scheme. Mini-games like Jump Rope or the duel with Blank are just as responsive as in the original. -It's $20. I bought it during the release sale for $16. I think it's a good price. -If it's not listed here, consider it untouched. As of writing this, I am 50 hours into the game, and I have found no gameplay differences from the original (the Cotton Robe trick still works, in case you were wondering.) It is as true to the original as it could be. Even the changes only enhance, never change or detract from what was already there.  Final Fantasy IX was, from it's inception, a love letter to the glory days of the classic Sword-and-Sorcery style JRPG. It feels like that now more than ever. It is bursting out of its sides with content, all of it dripping with nostalgia. It will always hold the title of The Quintessential JRPG.  If you loved Final Fantasy IX, and want to relive the experience, you should buy this game. If you loved Final Fantasy IX, and are unsure if the changes are enough to give the game a second play, you should buy this game. If you've never played Final Fantasy IX, and want to, but are unsure if this is the version you should play, you should buy this game. If you've never played Final Fantasy IX, and don't know if you want to, but you're a fan of SNES-generation JRPGs, you should buy this game.  If you've never played a JRPG, but want to try one, you should buy this game. If you have no intention of playing this game, but you like the idea of quality ports of old games coming to steam, you should buy this game. If you've made it to the end of this review, you should buy this game."
"If you think Dark Souls is hard you should see the first boss of this game. These three little girls with their jump rope are almost impossible to defeat. They really made a steep learning curve for this game. It probably wasn't even playtested or if it was, it was done by machines with perfect algorithms too difficult for humans to reproduce."
getting one shotted from a marble great stuff guys 11.4/10                            RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEE
"I have my old ps1 CD's for this. I have it on psn as well I think, and i have some ISO's i burned so i wouldn't muck up my cd's. And i still bought this.  I often go a day or two without eating because I would rather not spend money on food, and I still paid for this game at least 3 times now.   I love it, you should give it a shot you might love it too."
"Final Fantasy IX is one of my favorite games in the series and my favorite 3D FF imo. Square actully did a really good job with this port of the game. Here's a list of it's good and bad points...  GOOD &gt;&gt;Solid Storyline that is a nice feedback to the older games in the series and one that is fun &gt;&gt;Great characters that develop well throughout the story( a few stink tho) &gt;&gt;A lot of content &gt;&gt;30-40 hours of gameplay &gt;&gt;Fun minigames and side quests &gt;&gt;Great soundtrack &gt;&gt;Great gameplay that's easy to get into and understand. &gt;&gt;Solid level design &gt;&gt;Solid controls and camera &gt;&gt;Solid writing for the most part &gt;&gt;Great graphics(FMVs look great and in game models as well) &gt;&gt;Steam version has achievements &gt;&gt;Debug tweeks(Making the game run fast motion, having characters always attack at 9999 and much more) &gt;&gt;Random encounters are no more! Pressing a button changes it being random or not &gt;&gt;Boss fights are good(Ozma is a tough one) &gt;&gt;Solid framerate &gt;&gt;Still has a world map plus an airship and it's good &gt;&gt;Fast loading times &gt;&gt;Skipable FMVs!  BAD: &gt;&gt;A bit on the easy side &gt;&gt;A few characters I don't like &gt;&gt;This version isn't wide screen &gt;&gt;Tertra master is random  Overall FFIX is an awesome RPG and one that Is a good starting point to anyone that has never played a FF before, This version of the game is worth having and is a solid port  9/10"
"This is a pretty decent port, albeit with some odd shortcomings compared to the original. Probably the most awkward among them is that this port offers no real analog control, plus name entry is mouse+keyboard only. This is not a port that can be easily enjoyed in big picture mode (that said, this is plainly stated on the store page). I like mouse and keyboard support, but not when it fully supplants gamepad input. Overall, it seems like controller support was at best an afterthought, which makes sense in the context of a mobile release, but not for PC these days - and certainly not for a game that originally saw release on a console 16 years ago. It's more than a little obnoxious that I should have to hold a button to run while using the analog stick, rather than just using the analog stick like nearly every other 3D game has since Super Mario 64. Final Fantasy 9 really deserves better.  Otherwise, things are pretty good. Obviously the backgrounds don't hold up terribly well, but they get the job done. Only a handful of high resolution assets from development of the PS1 version still exist, and nobody reasonable was expecting Square Enix to remake the rest to match. I don't know what the situation is with the FMV, but it looks surprisingly nice. The 3D models of course look great, and while it is a shame the game is still 30 fps locked, I can't honestly say I'm that broken up about it.  At the end of the day, while it exhibits some unwelcome mobile-to-PC port idiosyncracies, this is still a good PC release of one of the best Final Fantasy games ever. It could use a bit more polish, but it's fun and nostalgic as is. If they improve the controller support, it'll be damn near perfect."
"The game looks and plays well. I've had no issues playing it.  Graphically, the updated character models look great. The game plays really well and i'm having as fun as I did when I played it back in 2001 on my PS1.  Only two real gripes I have with the game are the touch screen menu's. Being able to turn them back to the PSX origonals would be sweet as well as the extra navigations to exit the game. (or ALT+F4 if you're using a keyboard.. still annoying.)  Still, if you've ever been tempted to try and play the game and really don't want to mess around with ISO's, Emulators and Roms (or buy it on a console or mobile..) then grab it here. I wasn't disapointed.   TL;DR - Good Port. Minor annoyances.  FYI - If you're controller screws up, unplug, reboot and plug it back in. I haven't personally encountered it but otherrs have."
"Issue Resolved: the patch on June 27 has resolved my issues with Final Fantasy IX. The mouse pointer no longer centers when using a movement key. Thank you, Square, for fixing this bug. I am changing my review as a result.  Original Review:  I had been looking very forward to playing Final Fantasy IX for the first time. The story had me quickly engaged, and I was looking forward to my new adventure. However, the technical issues and bugs with the controls have soured me on this game.  As a disabled gamer, it is important that a game functions well in windowed mode with an on-screen keyboard. Final Fantasy IX currently has a very severe bug that centers your mouse pointer on your screen whenever you hit a movement key (WASD or the arrow keys). A game should never move your mouse pointer when you are not using the mouse. You press any of the directional for your character and the mouse will move. This is very irritating when using an on-screen keyboard.  This bug will also affect controllers if you are plagued with the character continually moving in one direction even when not pressing a joystick. Thus you will be required to use keyboard shortcuts to quit the game.  I recommend staying away from this game until Square takes the time to fix these issues."
"Almost 15 years ago this was my first Final Fantasy I completed. That time my english wasn't so good but I still understood most of the plot. I totally loved the game, the story, the world. It was like my first step into the world of fantasy roleplay games and I'm still on that path. Playing this awesome game once again gives me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of nostalgic feelings."
"If you are a fan of the ATB system I would recommend this game. Personally this is my favorite of the series however this could be due to it being the first one I played.   At the time of posting this there are still some bugs. That main one I notice is when starting the game with an Xbox one controller plugged in it does not work. To get it to work I have to unplug the controller, and then alt-tab out of the window and come back.   Other than the minor bugs this is an amazing game and story and is worth the buy. "
"Definitely my favorite Final Fantasy game so far and one of my favorite games overall. The game works well, I haven't encountered any glitches or problems at least yet. Controller works perfectly too. The new character models look very good, although the slightly blurry backgrounds make them sometimes stand out maybe a little too much. The HD cinematics though are very pretty and very well done. All in all, it's a good port. 100 out of 100 nobles were impressed."
"Aside from some controller issues and the backgrounds still looking the same, I'd say this is a fantastic port! Happy they finally got around to porting this, definitely my favourite Final Fantasy :D"
"It is everything I know and love and more ^_^. However I think I am experiencing a bug where my characters are suddenly doing max damage 9,999 at the begining of the game (between the monster hunt and 'end of disc one')"
great game glad to be able to play it agian.

"Superb port! This is my first time playing through this FF, and it looks and plays fantastic."
"Why not many JRPG today have feature like all Final Fantasy game from PS1 I mean lots of Secrets, mini game, Hidden weapon, Hidden Boss, and hidden area I really miss game like this"
"One of the best Final Fantasy games nicely remastered.  Cons - Backgrounds are pixelated and blurry  Mixed - Movies were upscaled and definetely better than they were but worse than if they where re-rendered in higher resolution.  Pros - 3D Models were nicely redone - Plays well on keyboard or controller - FF 9 on PC! Gameplay, story, music... They are just awesome.  It looks like the game was re-written on unity engine (I can be wrong in it) means it will be possible to mod the graphics.  P. S. Finished again. After 15 years since I've played it the very first time and game's touchy story made me cry again. Truly a masterpiece in terms of story."
"Having Final Fantasy 9 on PC is a dream come true. My older brother and I used to play this a lot when I was a kid (well, I used to watch him play mostly) and every second of this PC rerelease is pure 100% nostalgia.  The quality of the port from Silicon Studios is great: - The game's only crashed once so far but I had saved the game 1 minute earlier so I didn't really lose any progress. - Obviously, every piece of art hasn't been made HD as that would take forever. It's mostly just the cinematics (which look beautiful) and main characters of the game. There's a noticable difference between HD and non-HD textures in the game, but it's nothing that you can't deal with, especially if you're playing far away from your screen. - The new boosters are a welcome addition, even if it takes some time to find out how to activate them.  Overall, I'd say this only improves on my original PS1 copy, so if you liked the original; get this!"

"This is my all time fav Final Fantasy and i was worried that the pc port for this game would not do it jusities but i am so so pleased. It is just as i remembered but now with a new coat of paint. An awesome game!!   If you haven't played it and you like RPGs or JRPGs it is a must. To be honest i know a few who don't like JRPGs that much, but love this game.  Enjoy!"
great game glad to be able to play it agian.

"Final Fantasy IX is honestly my favourite so potential bias.   I'm not a single player game kinda guy but 9 just clicks for me. It's a perfect mix of drama, love, action, solid gameplay and end game content that has made me do multiple runthroughs of this game and still enjoy it to this day. I highly recommend this if you're new to RPGs, the Final Fantasy franchise or if you're a veteran of both. A few people complained about the updated UI but I really don't see a problem with it.   I honestly cannot find a reason for someone to not play this game. Top game of my childhood, top game of my adulthood. Perfect to grind and watch a movie to, perfect to play for hours on end and perfect to get pissy at busted extra bosses.   Seriously though, you'll find hours upon hours of entertainment in this game. The extra content in this game is rad."

"I just finished playing this game and I enjoyed it throughly. The characters are charming and it has classic Final Fantasy turn-based combat that I can't get enough of. My only complaint with the game is that the story was a little confusing at the end, but I would say that this is definitely one of the best Final Fantasys. With the updated graphics and fun boosters to make the game easier (speed up to reduce grinding time) or for those who just want to play for the story, I would say that this is definitely worth it's $21 price tag. Highly recommended for JRPG fans."

"Final Fantasy IX is easily my favourite game of all time. It's been my favourite game ever since I saw a double-page spread reviewing it in Official Playstation Magazine UK when I was about 11 years old and it's remained my favourite game to this day. I have collected all the figures and memorabilia (well, almost, if anyone has the Zidane and Dagger diorama or the Artbook hit me up!) and I am without question obsessed with this game and always will be. But why?  For starters it falls in the golden age of Squaresoft. The VI-X era where they could produce nothing but smash hit games. There was a feel to these games that they haven't been able to replicate since X (some would argue IX) and it is ever-present in this installment. If you've played either of the other PS1 Final Fantasys you will know what I mean.  The story, the soundtrack, the colourful characters, there are so many things that make this the perfect game. There are a number of mini-games, my personal favourite is Chocobo Hot &amp; Cold treasure hunting. It gives you a real sense of achievement and suitable reward and I never feel bored despite the numerous hours put into just one small facet of this game. Then there's the Tetra Master card game which tends to split the crowd, mainly because there's no adequate tutorial for it save a brief explanation from an NPC. But if you look up the rules you'll be hooked in no time.  + Story + Soundtrack + Diverse Cast of Characters + So Many Mini-Games + Satisfying Ability System + Many MANY Hours Worth of Gameplay + Gorgeous Pre-Rendered Backgrounds  = Turn-Based/Hybrid Turn-Based = Tetra Master Learning Curve  - Achievement for Excalibur II (requires beating the game in 12 hours, nobody should rush through this masterpiece) - HD Models Might Look Odd Against Classic Backgrounds at First  So if you like a good story (who doesn't) and if, like me, you're partial to Turn-Based RPGs, you really can't do better than Final Fantasy IX. It is a testament to the JRPG and RPG genre as a whole. Worth full price, especially considering how expensive the discs are."
"Truly the pinnacle of one of the greatest franchises in the history of gaming, Final Fantasy IX is a perfect blend of charming characters, a great story, a whimsical fantasy art style, and genuine heart."
"Never played a FF game and gotta say I really enjoy this one. I always thought that the combat is going to turn me off, but it is actually pretty fun when you get more abilities and spells. Story is also pretty interesting."
"I played Final Fantasy IX about seven years ago (which is 10 years after its release) during a time where I couldn't get into single-player games. Countless other games were dropped after only a few hours in, but this one managed to revive my love for single-player games.  The story is amazing. It has a cheerful start which sucks the player into the game world, which later reveals its dark secrets, as well. It is an interesting, well-paced story with enough plot twists and humorous moments. Most of the characters are lovable and have sufficient background stories.  The gameplay incorporates a twist of the Active Time Battle system similar to previous Final Fantasy games. Each character has a unique role in battle. The acquisition of new abilities and the leveling speed are well-paced. Battles happen randomly as you travel throughout the world, but the frequency of battles can be overwhelming at times. The game includes several sidequests and mini-games, ranging from powerful option bosses to card games like Tetra Master or Blackjack.  Every Final Fantasy had amazing music so far, but the soundtrack of the ninth installment surpasses it all. It has a memorable main theme which plays on various occasions in different versions throughout the game. It also features a variety of other outstanding tracks. None of the tracks may be the best of what the franchise has to offer, but as a whole, the soundtrack is definitely my favorite within the franchise.  I cannot talk much about the quality of the port since I have yet to dedicate any time to it, but there are a few issues I would like to point out. The battle menu is atrocious. It is the same design found on the mobile phone port of the game. The character models have been redone, but the backgrounds have only gone through a simple filter. This makes the sharp character models stand out too much from the somewhat blurry background. Given the steep price of 21€, you would expect more work to have gone into this port. Compared to most other ports of games from the same era, the price is pretty steep. On the other hand, you are still looking at at least 50 hours of gameplay in an amazing game."
"I genuinely don't have any words that can do this game justice.   The best I can do this is this. I had never played a Final Fantasy game before. I've been well entrenched in most genres of games I play, and they're never JRPGs. I played FFIX for the first time in December 2014, finishing April 2015 with a set of 4 original Playstation 1 disks, played on my PS2 slim. From start to finish, Final Fantasy IX made me feel like a child again, a feeling I have not gotten from anything else; the wonder and joy of discovering a new world and potential possibilities in a smorgasboard of beautiful art design and lovingly crafted world and simple, and unpretentous characters. It is the only game that has to date, made me cry (read: bawl into a pillow) out of genuine sadness, not only because of the story and how engrossing it was for fourty hours of game time, but because I had beaten the game and the world and story was completed, 'fin.' I can never experience FFIX the same way I did again, not knowing what to expect, devouring every bit of detail like a kid in a candy shop.  Needless to say, FFIX is my favourite game of all time. Even if the game mechanics can be slightly old and outdated, and some parts can be obnoxious, and the story might have a few janky points, no other game has ever made me feel the way IX did the first time playing it. This is one of those games you need to set yourself down for a weekend, and savour the experience. It's not about the progression or equipment. It's not about hitting 9999 damage. It's about having a good time and enjoying the game for what it is. And maybe you'll get to rediscover (legitimately speaking) some childhood wonder beneath layers of salt and experiences."
"Simply put one of the best RPG's ever made for the playstation. While other Final Fantasy games have their own place at the top of the class I feel like FFIX pulled off a engaging story, rewarding character system, and addicting minigames. The stylized graphics still hold up very well and the music like any final fantasy keeps you entrhalled with the world. Unlike a lot PS1 era games FFIX still holds up very well to this day so do yourself a favor and pick it up, but don't blame me when you can't put it down."
"I love this game so much. It was part of my childhood and still holds a very special place in my heart.  The gameplay is easy enough to get the hang of, the graphics still look pretty stellar (especially considering this is a PS1 game), and the music is still good. No game is without its faults, though, since parts of the story feel rushed and there was potential in a few characters that I don't think was expanded on like it could have been.  Despite this, I still feel like this is the best Final Fantasy to have come out. There's a lot of heart in the story and in all the characters, and even the side characters feel like they're living IN the world and aren't JUST NPCs for you to interact with. There are a lot of little details sprinkled in each setting to add to the worldbuilding, like if you examine a statue in Alexandria's front gate in the very beginning, there's a little blurb about who it is and why the statue exists. Little things like that make the world feel more real, feel like it has a really rich history, without needing a lot of extra movies or games.  I absolutely recommend this game to anyone. Admittedly, the game takes awhile, but I think it's totally worth it."
"Final Fantasy VII usually gets all the limelight but I feel this Final Fantasy (and VIII) get over shadowed by it. FF VII is a brilliant game no doubt but this one has something VII doesn't quite have, I'm not quite sure what that is but this one has it.   Fantastic art style, music and characters that no other FF has been able to match yet. The story loses its edge towards the end I feel but the characters themselves and their stories really make up for that and more; especially Vivi's.   If you don't almost shed a tear at one of the FMV's involving Vivi on one of the airships (I'm sure most fans will know the one im talking about, gets me everytime) then you must be an AI. That little guy doesn't have much of a face but he probably has the most 'human' story of all the characters.  One of the best ports SE has done (THANK GOD COS THIS GAME DESERVED IT!).  And don't let my play time fool you, I completed this game countless times on my PS1.  BUY IT!"
"This is, without a doubt, my favorite Final Fantasy game. It has everything in it that I love about every game previous to it, and I have yet to play a newer Final Fantasy game that even comes close to rivalling FFIX as my favorite. The characters are varied and generally interesting (some for very different reasons than others), The player is told enough about the world to make the world seem like a living place without going overboard by explaining every little thing. Anything that is commonplace to the characters is merely experienced rather than explained, which means that the exposition is limited to what is truly important. Everything that is not important to the plot and individual character arcs is demonstrated at least as much (often more so) than stated. The humor is effective and prevelant, and stands beside some deeply emotional plot with quite a bit of tragedy. The plot is very serious, but the game doesn't take itself too seriously.  The game really did not get the attention it deserved when it was originally released on the Playstation, primarily (in my experience) because of the less realistic art style in comparison to FFVIII. However, I feel that it deserves all of the praise that it has gotten since. Very few games have managed to make me genuinely feel as wide a range of emotion as this one. The first time I played it I laughed hard enough to nearly fall over, felt genuine horror (not all of which was related to Kuja's creepiness), and cried real tears. Furthermore, I have not before or since played a game that made me want to see a particular villain dead consistently yet made me cry for the same villain in the end. There is also a major plot twist (or more, depending on your milage) that is genuinely surprising if you don't already know what is going to happen.  The music is fantastic, and many of my favorite Final Fantasy tracks that aren't repeated throughout the series are from this game. Not one track actually annoyed me, which is something I haven't been able to say about any of the Final Fantasys that came after it. The musical direction is on point, and always serves to punctuate the intended impact of emotional or plot-heavy scenes.  There are many secrets to find through extra exploration around the world, and the use of chocobos to find hidden treasures is a lot of fun. I even like the Hot and Cold chocobo mini game that you need to play to get most of the chocographs. Most mini games of similar sorts that I've had to play in other games have gotten boring after a while, but for some reason the Chocobo Hot and Cold never gets tiring enough to never want to do it again.  The HD remastering is well done, and makes the game so much easier to enjoy on modern displays. My sister finished replaying the original version just a couple of weeks before the PC release was announced, which means that I can say with authority that the improvement is significant. There are telltale signs that the graphics were smoothed and updated from a much lower resolution, but it's not nearly as distracting as it would be if they had not been updated at all. They actually did an even better job of improving the visual quality than I would have expected, mainly because I tend to be rather cynical in my expectations for such things.  Overall, my opinion is that it would be a disservice to the series to discount this one and all of the things they did right in it. I know that it won't be everyone's favorite, and it probably won't change the opinions of most people who don't like turn based rpgs. It's not absolute perfection, but it is a must play if you enjoy games of this genre. To give it a serious rating, I would give it a 9/10.  However, I can't resist also adding my significantly more subjective rating as well.  10/10 - Would see an artificially created life form get married by dwarves to an androgenous frog-eating chef in order to save the world again."
5 stars! I remember being a kid and being so impressed with FF7 and FF8 on PC and wishing they would make this game for PC. It took a while but I coudn't be happier! I am running this on a cheap mini 2-in-1 nextbook and it runs perfectly. Graphics are maxed and there is no lag. Obviously the game has been enhanced with higher res and boosters. The movies play perfect and the music is nice. They do not make RPGs this good anymore! Completely worth the purchase. A+++! The only thing we're missing now is the FF6 remake for PC!! :)
"I'm not going to drone on and on about this title since there's so much material out there. It seems people are all over the board on this game. Personally, I enjoyed the heck out of FFIX when it first came out and after purchasing it anew on Steam, I'm firmly reminded my childhood time spent in this world was not wasted.   The improved graphics are nice, even with background textures the same. The clash between new/old graphics is not in any way (to me) distracting or tacked-on-feeling. I rather enjoy the updated character models.  Totally worth the buy, I'd say even at full price if you're into Final Fantasy. There's a wealth of content to soak in. Imaginative characters, humor, mini-games (mostly worthwhile ones), an excellently crafted, curious world, varied and engaging dialogue, and many, many more aspects I could list that make FFIX one of the standout FF titles.  The only thing I can really gripe about are the somewhat long load times for entering battle and the ATB meter could fill up a bit more quickly, just a tad really. I'm saying this considering one has changed battle speed to fastest in the config menu, so yes, even once that's turned up, I still consider the ATB just a little slower than I would prefer it. However, considering all things, this is a fairly minor gripe."
"Final Fantasy IX is a game I remember fondly from my childhood. It combines great action with a just as pleasing story that keeps you interested throughout the game. Even now, that I am older than when I was child, I am just as fond to the charcters and story now than at the time I was a child. There are several key points of the game and this port that I would like to mention:  -This steam port works very well for me; however, some reviews mention glitches and lag. -HD textures really help up the quality of the game, but they should have also redone the backgrounds to be HD as well. -The fighting is as fun as it was on the PlayStation 1. -The soundtrack in this game is also amazing. -This game (as I mentioned above) has a very compelling story.  There are a lot of great RPG's out there, but this is one is definitly at the top of my list as one of the best. If you are a fan of RPG's, then this game is worth a try."
"I don't mind the 4:3 aspect ratio. I don't mind the OPTIONAL game boosters. I don't mind the mobile UI. And I don't mind everything else others complained about.  But what I can not accept after so many years of waiting is a critical controlling bug right at the start of the game!  Like many others posted before. Right after the game starts and let's you controll the character, he walks to the right and get's stuck there. You can't move him. You can't swith to Keyboard. You can't do anything!  This needs to be fixed, immediately! Otherwise, this is a great game and I can't wait to play it again.  Otherwise, this is a great game. It's the best in the entire series IMHO and you should definitely try it out if you are interested.  Edit: Apparently you can solve this issue by deaktivating the Human Interface Devices in the Device Manger. After deactivating them all and re-activating them one by one, I could find the one that was causing the error."
"I'm sorry, but this has to be the RPG of it's style, and easily the best game in the Final Fantasy series. The plot is 11/10, and the gameplay (although it'll keep you going for weeks) is equally impressive."
"Loved the game first time around, still love it now. Master Vivi always been my fave char."
My favourite Final Fantasy experience brought to steam with improved graphics A must-buy for me. Well worth the money to relive this great game from my childhood that still holds up.
"A LONG(ish) REVIEW OF WHAT TO EXPECT.   ***EDIT- Just found out that SE lost the original HD renders of the backround scenes, hence why they didnt put them in the game.***  Pretty much as expected from what the other remastered FF games have been like. I was hoping that SE would of included HD versions of the game backround scenes as they made HD versions when the game was developed then they downscaled them so the PS1 could run the game, it was a bit of downer that they didnt include them. The NPC's are sharpened up to the same standard as the other remastered FF games. The cutscenes have been tidied up and there are the cheats (if ya want to use them) as seen in the other FF games.   Alot of the Negative reviews are due to a 'Xbox controller' bug but i have not come across this so far or because they where expecting the graphics to be better and it being scaled to 16:9 Aspect Ratio, well i dont really know what those people where expecting. It's a PS1 game that is 15ish years old so dont get your hopes up if ya thinking this is a full on redo of the game cus its not xD.   After installing the gameplay was jittery but a quick PC reboot sorted that issue.  Pro: - The best FF game ever made has now come to PC - sharpened NPC's (no more blurry characters) happy days \o/ - 100's of hours of great gameplay and story from a time where RPG's where in their prime.  Cons: - No HD backround scenes in the game (though not surpised) - Cutscene's locked at 15fps/ Gameplay locked at 30fps - Maybe a bug or two  - Looks like its a port from the mobile version of the game  Final Words: Not much to say really, it is what it is. People who have played the remastered versions of FF 7/8 will know what to expect. Its a shame that they didnt include HD versions of the backround scenes as they where made when the game was develped, SE have had 15 years to implement into the PC version of the game, however, that is prob my only gripe.   Dont expect a full-on redo because you will be left with a bitter taste in ya mouth. All you should expect from this game is a vanilla game with sharpened NPC's a few pointless cheats, cloud game saves &amp; steam trophies.  With all that in mind i am very happy with my purchase, i get to play prob the best FF (yet under-rated) game ever made on pc. Veteran's of the game will be happy with just having the game on PC and for those who have not played the game then give it a go. Its a very relaxed gameplay style with some of the best storytelling that has ever been created for the gaming industry.   Hope this review was helpful, thumbs up/down if ya liked/disagreed with my evaluation. Enjoy &amp; Good luck"
"I first played this game when it had just been published in Europe, at my friend's house, till late night. I was captivated by the music, the story, the characters... Everything kept me under spell, till finally I beat it. Best three days of my life. Now that my PS2 console is busted, I no longer can play this but thank gods for this release, I can finally relive the best moments of gaming!   What I like: Characters. I love Zidane and his attitude. Even though laid back, he has wisdom in him that he shares with others. Dagger, well, she's your everyday naive princess, but during the course of the game she grows up to be the ruler that her kingdom needs. Steiner... oh... Steiner! The sass he and Zidane exchange... I love it! Vivi is like me - introvert, uncertain, hesitant with low self-esteem, but underneath all that he holds the power to destroy the world if he so chooses. Sadly I can't do magic... but Vivi is still probably my number one character. Quina... the must-have comic relief... but s/he is till better than Jar-Jar :P (please don't kill me). Freya... I love her 'To be forgotten is worse than death' phrase. She's my must have member in the main party. (I soloed the last boss with her! THAT was a thrill.) Eiko is that perky little girl that everyone loves... or hates... I personally keep her as a second healer in party. Amarant... no opinion. He's awesome but I hardly ever keep him in my party. Main villain, however, is just... meh. Kefka is better, Sephiroth is better... but I think he was made for the fangirls to drool. Those hips man... those hips don't lie!  Music: Uematsu-sensei deserves much praise for the music he composed. I love Melodies of Life theme song a lot, and I find myself singing it to the tune everytime.   Story: 10/10, nothing else to say. Play it! Experience it!   New graphics give more depth to the design, so yes, I like it.   What I don't like:  The chance for random battles have obviously been decreased. I love grinding. In the PS version I wouldn't need to take more than 5 steps before the next fight, now I need to walk around for a minute before I get into a fight. I hope this issue is fixed or at least checked upon. I need them levels and I don't want to waste time by running around looking for random fights when those fights should basically come to me.   The battle UI is wayt too big! It's distractingly huge and the spell quickly browsing (RB/LB) the spell list make the cursor go to the bottom and not stay on the spot... I'm used to the PS version where the cursor stays on the spot and when quickly browsing the spell list the spell is easier to choose. I don't use 'Wait' mode in battle. So... yeah... But it's fine, this is only a minor thing and I'm sure someone will come up with a solution.    Overall:   Play this game! It's 10/10, and all those old school gamers should feel the nostalgia when FURUSATO plays on the menu screen."
"Good port. I have issues with needing to unplug my controller before starting the application, but that is a minor annoyance and shouldn't change my review.  As far as the game goes, get it. It's one of the good ones in the series."
"Loved the game first time around, still love it now. Master Vivi always been my fave char."
5/5 would watch again
Watching the play I brought a fake ticket to can wait some chick won a card game against me and stole my 1000 jump rope earned Alexandria card
"This is a really nice port (especially compared to some of the other recent ff pc ports, like ffvi). The main playable characters are retextured with nice, sharp details. While this is a little incongruous with the backgrounds which for reasons already mentioned here were not able to be remastered, this did not detract from my experience of the game. I definitely recommend fans of the Final Fantasy franchise pick this one up."
"Good port. I have issues with needing to unplug my controller before starting the application, but that is a minor annoyance and shouldn't change my review.  As far as the game goes, get it. It's one of the good ones in the series."
"This is the fourth time I'm playing this game now, since the PS1 days. I still remember their game discs were made in black, and that added on to the special feeling I have for FF9 since then.  I will not compare to other Final Fantasy games because each has its own attraction and audience. For me, FF9 feels like a throwback to the classic FF system. Although the mechanisms may seem simple, along with its simplistic graphics, it allowed me to 'fill in the gaps' in my mind with my imagination, and allowed me to immerse in its story and emotions.  This is my Final Fantasy, and this is how I tell and re-tell the story. This is the fourth time I'm re-telling the story, and I still have more interpretations each time. Final Fantasy is about telling a story like no other games can. Yes, graphics may be a boon, but if a Final Fantasy game can't tell a story 10x better than its graphics could, then it has failed as a Final Fantasy.  I believe Final Fantasy IX has done that. It shows how great games don't necessarily need to have life-like facial features and individually-moving strands of hair. In fact, I'd rather let the mind fill in those gaps for me, as that is actually more enjoyable and personal than having everything laid out for me.  This is my Final Fantasy, and this is how I tell and re-tell the story. Have you told your story?"

"Let's get this out of the way  - FPS is locked to 30, 15 for cutscenes  - The backgrounds look a little blurry and contrast with the crisp character details  It's not ideal but none of this matters, Final Fantasy IX is finally on PC and it looks, sounds and handles great especially for a title that came out in 2000.  A solid delivery from SquareEnix, now to wait for X and X-2!"
The best Final Fantasy gets a fantastic re-release. The addition of Steam achievements just made it all the more enticing.
  good graphic ~
"Contrary to what some of the more butthurt older Final Fantasy IX fans may say, as someone who beat the hell out of the original PS1 version of this game I find this port to be amazing. It is very well done, and the updates they have applied have only enhanced the experience for me! I have heard people complaining about supposed sound bugs, and controller issues but have not experienced any such bug myself. I am completely in love with this remastered version of my absolute favorite game in this series."

"Very decent port, runs flawlessly. Shame for the original backgrounds but I guess it couldn't be helped. The cheats and various enhancements are nice, I just wish they were more documented and for some hard to activate. It feels stupid when you pause a fight, accidentaly hit one of the cheat keys, and come back to all your dudes in Trance mode or hitting 9999. The game speed up one is especially useful when doing the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. It might just be me going crazy but in my run I feel like my steal chances are very very very low. Every boss fight takes me an eternity if I want to steal their stuff :("
"Spend 8 hours jumping rope with little girls 20 minutes into the game. Jokes aside fantastic game, fantastic story, great characters, amazing OST. Combat is standard ATB system while actual skills come more with grinding than they do with leveling. All in all a classic, my favorite FF game among them all."
"Do not let the time I have on record fool you. I played this game when it first released on the PlayStation 1, and since then I have played the game almost every year or two. The game is timeless. It is possibly the best Final Fantasy game out there today, and possibly one of the best JRPG titles out there to play. The game has an amazing soundtrack, nice art style, great cast of characters, a great story, and a huge overworld. A must play for any JRPG fan, and honestly a great entry point for those who want to get their feet wet into the genre."
"Bought this game 3 times, best FF game.  10/10 Would buy 3 times again."
A great throwback to classic Final Fantasy. This game was ported well from the mobile release and continues to capture the magic in did back in the PS1 era.
"My favorite Final fantasy , Fantastic music, great characters, and fun game play!"
My number one most favorite game of all time. This game hits me right square in the fucxing feels!
"Looks good, sounds good, gosh darnit if feels good."
It's nice to see SE finally put some effort into porting their old games. This is by far the best version of this classic.
"My favorite Final Fantasy game ever. All the characters have deep stories behind them and are very memorable(I don't think i'll ever forget any of the side-characters). The story is one of the best in the FF series. Knights, dragons and castles! What else do you want? Get ready for a whole lot of feels in this story behind Zidane who starts his adventure as a bandit at the Tantalus Theater Troupe.  Definitely recommended for newcomers and veterans of the Final Fantasy series."
"Waaah! 30fps! Waaaah! 4:3 ratio!   Seriously. Is this all we talk about in games these days? Does FPS really matter that much to people? What happened to story, game play, writing! It's all Graphics and frame rate!   People act like we never played snes games &gt;_&gt;  No need to write a review, you know how good this game is and the port honestly makes it a lot better."
Best Final Fantasy so far in my opinion and also the first I played back in my youth. I own the original on PS1 and is nice to be able to experience on PC with better graphics and Steam features like achievements and trading cards. 10/10
"Lemme tell you a story. Fourteen years ago I was a sixteen year old boy with teenage angst dripping out my ears, parents in the middle of a very messy divorce, and a high school life that was like Saved by the Bell combined with the nastier bits of the Dante's Inferno video game. During this time my only solace was video games and, for Christmas in 2001 I recieved two things: a Playstation 1 system and my first game for it, Final Fantasy IX. This was the start of a large library of JRPG games including Xenogears, Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, Wild ARMs 2nd Ignition, and more.  Seeing this game appear on Steam for me is like running into an old dear friend that you haven't seen in a very long time. Its been years, but you're just as happy to see them again and hear their stories as you were when you first met.  So, what do I like about this one?  - The character and NPC models have all been redone to appear much sharper and more detailed than the original release. Its neat to actually be able to see non-pixelated details on their faces and bodies compared to the 1999 version. - The game controls well and I've only had one issue so far in the Ice Cavern (one of the contextual spots where Vivi uses his magic to melt a path to a treasure chest refused to respond. I already had a Mage Masher so it's not a HUGE deal, but irritating nonetheless). - The music is every bit as good as I remember it, I had to pause for a moment the first time I got to the overworld just to sit and listen to that song for a while. I've heard some people complain that the music sounds 'tinny' and 'not as good as the original' and, honestly, I wonder if they're just not remembering it right. I mean it came out seventeen years ago. Its been a while.  Things I didn't like: - The game is fully compatable with my 360 controller... but the default button for Yes/Confirm is B? As in the button that, nine times out of ten, is the EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT?! To quote Messir Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw, 'Are you taking the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥?'. Thankfully you can edit the buttons immediately, but it almost feels like they picked that one just to screw with people. - ... thats actually it so far. Square did a pretty good port this time. Now all that Square needs to do is re-release games like Final Fantasy XII, Dragon Quest VIII, and Kingdom Hearts on the PC. Seriously Squeenix, what are you waiting for? Do you not WANT every gamer to throw their wallets at you?"
"Pure nostalgia. Looking back at what this series used to be is bittersweet, to say the least."
"Have best ost from all series imho, the characters are lovable too ^^"
Best game of the FF saga
This is perfection brings me back to childhood
BEST GAME EVER. I was waiting for it on PC and I am not disappointed. :D
"Arguably one of the best video games of all time, and this port is done very well. The cinematics have never looked more beautiful and the game is as fully operational as when I remember it back in 2000.  100/100."
The best version of one of the best jrpgs ever made.
"I took down my orignal review because the one major issue I had with the game was fixed.  Anyhow, Square actually learned from their mistakes and put thought into this port. Controls can be mapped and they actually show up when prompts are shown. I wouldn't have minded an option for battle to run at 60fps than 15. Unfortunate, but I can manage. I'm really enjoying the game so far and I hope it stays that way.  Oh yeah, and one more thing. If you are getting controller issues, try pluggin in the Xbox One/360 controller AFTER booting the game."
"Have always loved this game, and the reboot does not disappoint. Cleaned up graphics and no longer waiting on long disc load times are just scratching the surface. Any fan of the original FF9, or any other game in the series for that matter, should pick this up right away!"
"Zorn: This is a great quality port! Thorn: A quality port this is great!  But, seriously there's nothing to complain about aside from 4:3 screen ratio as the only option. Characters are greatly graphically improved, gameplay mechanics got adapted for PC especially, but you can choose to play without those mechanics. The same epic feeling from the story with a pinch of nostalgia. Well, yes there's the less refined backgrounds, but if that would be graphically remade, we would wait for this gem to the Early Spring... of 2020!! :D  Would recommend to anyone. (Mostly to people, who have a great taste in games obviously.)"
Best in the series. If you disagree you are wrong.   Sorry
"This is Final Fantasy IX!  If you are reading this, then you already know you want it, so stop reading this and go buy it, now!  My only quibble is 30fps gameplay (very minor, slow game) and 15fps cinematics, thats a little more annoying, but I can ignore it. With the various boosts (battle times specifically), improved cinematics, fully customiseable xbox controller support and ability to play at any resolution, it is worth every cent, now back to the game!"
"This game is pretty much the way you remembered it back in the year 2000. If you haven't played the game before, then mostly everything is left untouched (story, game mechanics, etc) and you should read a review elsewhere for how the game is in regards to that. I'm going to talk about the port itself and what changes it brought to the table.   Off the bat, the character models had their textures bumped up to higher quality. No longer are faces blurred out because now you can see them with great clarity. Even NPCs had their textures bumped up too! However, the backgrounds are still in their old Playstation low resolution versions and rumors state that the developers lost the assets for the backgrounds. It's very distracting and clashes heavily with the new high res character models. While it doesn't bother me too much, it may be a deal breaker for others. The FMVs also had a bump up in quality and are not fuzzy or blurry anymore, which is another nice touch.    The port also has several game boosters that you can turn on and off at will, such as making the game go faster in turbo speed, always do max damage, disable random encounters, and always have full ATB and Trance bars. The other boosters such as max level and magic stones, instant learn abilities, and max gil can't be disabled once turned on. The boosters are nice to have if you want to screw around or just want to get to certain parts of the game with little hassle and you can easily enjoy the game without them. However, it is quite easy to accidentally turn a booster on by mistake if you're aren't careful.   There are a few bugs, but they're mostly minor. There's the infamous 'character moves to the right' bug when it comes to using controllers, but so far I have managed to get around it by only enabling the controller after the game has loaded. In certain battles or battle screens, the dynamic camera can get screwed up such as zooming in too closely on a character or the camera focusing on the wrong character when an enemy readies an ability. While distracting, they're just minor annoyances.   Overall, the port is pretty solid and the extra features are a welcomed addition. Minor bugs are present, but nothing too deal breaking."
"Easily my favorite Final Fantasy game of all-time, and the last great one before the series started to go downhill into irrelevance.  As a port, it's solid. The backgrounds are ugly, but I didn't really expect them to re-do all of them for a port of a sixteen year old game. The characters themselves look fine, and the cut-scenes look great. I've had no issues with controller support (using the PC version of the 360 controller), and I like that you can edit buttons, as the game originally has B as confirm and A as back, which is stupid. Was able to easily swap them and then no issues.  There are built in cheats for anyone who is interested in that sort of thing, along with more useful legit abilities like speeding up combat and turning off the over-long pre-fight cut-scenes (which I believe were there to mask loading on the PSX but are obviously no longer necessary). Removing those scenes alone probably cuts your overall game time by a couple of hours, especially if you're playing legitimate and thus are likely grinding a lot.  The card game still sucks and is totally pointless.   Anyway, Final Fantasy IX received a solid port. It's not amazing, but it's perfectly acceptable. I'd say the game is a little overpriced at $21.99 (I paid $16.79, but the price will go back up soon). It should have released at no more than $15.00. Still, if you're a fan of the original game or want to play the best and last great game in the series, or just one of the better JRPGs ever released (by the way, why can't we get Chrono Trigger on Steam?), this would be a good choice."
"This isn't the best Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy 6 is the best one. But this is a VERY close second, and my personal favorite in the series. I played quite a bit of this game as a kid, and still have my original copy. However, I decided to give the PC port a shot, and I'm glad I did. The character models and cutscenes are much more polished looking in this version, and the autosave/faster load times make this the best version I've played of this game.   The only things that bother me with this version that I've seen so far, are that the game caps at 30fps, and there is a bar on each side of the screen (at least at the resolution I have it set at for my monitor). However, I'm hoping that these issues will get fixed with mods. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the old Final Fantasy games and never got around to playing this one, OR if you just want to play the game again and relive your childhood.  9.5/10"
"What can I say? It would be a sin if I didn't review this.  Final Fantasy IX isn't only my favourite game from the series - it's my favourite game of all time. It's the first Final Fantasy I played, and it's the one I could return to every single year until I expire. I played this continuously when it was first released back on the Playstation.  As a huge time fan/writer of medieval fantasy, this game really does have it all for me. The plot is, for the most part, a gripping tale of intrigue, romance and adventure. The (main) villain is one of the most charismatic of all, despite their very questionable fashion sense. The character development is second-to-none, easily the best from the series (Zidane and Vivi, especially.) It also features my favourite female protagonist from the entire series.  The setting is wonderful. No two places look the same, and the environments are all unique and memorable (though in the case of one particular dungeon, you're likely to remember it for all the wrong reasons...)  The music. My God, the music. This soundtrack is a masterpiece and the work of a true legend of composing, Nobuo Uematsu. I want to be Uematsu. Seriously. Character themes, environment themes, battle themes and that beautiful, beautiful world map theme - there's not a single track that I don't like.  The sidequests are fantastic (a couple are a little irritating, like one involving a skipping rope, but all entirely optional.) The Chocobo one is easily unbeaten and rewards you very, very well for your time. I also think I'm the only person on Earth who actually enjoyed the card game.  I could honestly write more - so, so much more - about why I love this game. But I would be here all day. Let's just say that I enjoyed the original release so much that I actually got the Excalibur II in a repeat playthrough because I wanted to see EVERYTHING that this game had. Buy it. Just...buy the damn game. Please.   "
"If you're here to experience the original game, good news, it's pretty much a perfect port. Bad news: there's two things they ported as-is: Framerate (capped at 30fps, why?) and map textures. Which means you'll be playing the game with HD character models on a low definition world, at 30fps, quite jarring."
"This is one my favorite games in the FF series, I played it many times since its release back in 2000, it feels like the last true Final Fantasy before Square merged with Enix. While this is based off the Android version, the visuals are crisp, original soundtrack, models look great and controls are solid. Definitely recommend getting this for PC for sure :D"
The good FFIX we all know and love with some added features. Pros:  - Mouse controls which is a nice addition - Retextured characters and items - Great story  Cons: - Moving character with the mouse can be difficult.  
"An enchanting experience that holds up 16 years later, Final Fantasy 9 has it all: stellar gameplay, lovely music, heart-warming characters, solid story, and a powerful theme that will have you begging to stay in such an amazing world."
"Final Fantasy 9... It's nostalgic to play the game again. Okay, to business.  First of all, look at my playtime on steam (negligable at the moment) and multiply it by a thousand and you MIGHT have my total played hours. Back in the day when the game originally came out, I must have played, and replayed it at LEAST a dozen times. Each time having several hundred hours. Over the years I played the game again but with more time in between but still, I can play it through blindly and usually without dying too much. I know which levels I should have (roughly) but nevertheless I know everything there is to know about the game.  I'm not going to bother to go over the graphics. The game is from the year two thousand so its well over a decade old. You can't expect the game to look pretty compared to modern games.  music / sound The music is awesome. The songs and music of final fantasy nine are perfect and don't get on your nerves too quickly. Of course, if you let the game on loop then it might be a bit much....  Plot When I played the game for the very first time, it was a gift for my tenth birthday. (I think) The thing is, I picked it because it had four cd's. But I absolutely NEVER regretted buying... well okay having the game bought for me (details) But seriously, I never regret getting the game or playing it. And again. And again.  Back then, I didn't have accesss to the internet, but I did have access to a walkthrough which did help me a lot. It told me how much hp enemies had and I must have died hundreds of times. I remember that I pulled the plug (after making sure I wouldn't lose too much progress) in frustration at least a dozen times.  So the question remains... Should you buy the game? Well it depends. For me, I bought it as soon as I realized it was available. I didn't hesitate for a  second.Why?  Because I know what I'm getting. I bought the game because I wanted to play it on pc. That was one reason. But I also wanted it because it's one of my favorite games of all times and well.. I can afford it so why not?  You, the prospect buyer should probably watch a few let's plays or a review (when it comes) before deciding if you should purchase or not. The game looks a bit prettier, and the models are updated, but I don't think anything was changed mechanic wise. Of course there are a few cheat options but you should only use that after finishing the game at least once.  Should you buy?  YES! Definetly but only after making sure you know what you're getting.  Kingdark"
"Why you care about small things? World very simple place. World only have two things: Things you can eat and things you no can eat.  Wonderful game, you should get it."
"It's really a great game. I've played most of the final fantasy games alot, and it doesn't matter that its not a 'remastered' version of the game. It's really alot of fun so far, and i look forward to putting many hours into it. :)"
"Oh thank god. This is everything I was hoping for and more. All the little tweaks they've added definitely improve the experience on FFIX. If you have friends who haven't played this, now is definitely the time.   Good: The game's sprites look awesome!! I love the new unit graphics! An icon letting you know if someone's willing to play cards with you! GENIUS! Click to move! ...Sort of! The new battle screen is really cool!  Bad: Click to move sometimes has a hard time transitioning to a different map.  Ugly: Everything other than the characters and new battle effects. The scenery and such still feels blurry and out of focus, but at least for me, this is minor.  Definitely a thumbs up."
"My absolute favourite game I've ever played.  The port is okay and the new features are great. If you're from Europe, this is the easiest way to play the game at the correct speed. No performance issues for me. You can turn off the encounter start animation, reducing the time the fights take by quite a bit. You can also skip FMV cutscenes (you still can't do this in FFX on PS4). Other notable changes include being able to continue where you died instead of having to load your previous save.  Considering all this (even if you dislike being able to continue from where you left off), I'd say this is the definitive version of Final Fantasy IX. Eventually there will be mods to help with the low-resolution backgrounds which is my only gripe with this release. Even a simple post processing method would be enough to remedy this. Meanwhile I can still recommend this as you won't be able to find a better version anywhere."
"I've saw some ppl talking about problems they have about this game, but myself, I dont have any. I've waited to play a little before making an evaluation for the game (I've saw some evaluation with less then 1h playtime...), I have 35 but in real I'm more about 25h.  If you never played FFIX and you like (j)RPG, you need to try this game at least once, this game is so great, the combat system, the story, the OST (my favorite OST for a game), the characters, specially Vivi, Steiner and the princess, the only little thing I could say about this game, is the lack of post-game content, there is a few thing to do, but maybe they could have do more.  And if you already played FFIX, then it depend how much you liked it, maybe I love that game, that's why it's a good reason enough to buy it and play it again.  The only reason you should not buy it is, if you played it already and you didn't like enough (I dont understand how this can be possible...), or if you dont like RPGs.  I hope my evalution will help you to decide."
"I've waited over 10 years for this game to be released on again, and Steam finally did. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this game. Everything from the smooth controls, to the stunning graphics, to the amazing sound, everything is perfect. It's reliving my childhood in modern age. This is my favorite game of all time, and I can't think of a thing to that can be improved about this game. Also, disregard the negative comments and reviews of this game. All of them are about how their game controllers don't work. That's because the game doesn't have full controller support, so it's not going to work fully."
"Remember back when Square made good games that didn't involve the character cast looking like a k-pop boy band? And also didn't have character names as bland as eg: Vanilla, Snow, Lightning, Fang and other 8 year old choices? Back when the stories were rich and filled with drama, romance, combat, actual magic, hundreds of different races and species of humanoids and so forth? Back when the games gave you freedom to roam the map and do some side questing 'before' the halfway point in the game, or final disk.  With hundreds of treasure chests, secret treasures, easter eggs, mini games with rewards, tetra card matches, ATEs, and everything inbetween this game is fleshed out perfectly and has no plot holes or anything else hindering it's story.  This game will have you thinking about many things as you progress through the story and see how each main character's own growth changes. 10/10 P.S.  Square, release Chrono Cross on steam. You won't be disappoint. ;)"
"After 10 years of first being introduced to this game, I finally got the chance to actually finish it all the way through, and I have to say that it was an amazing experience. Memorable characters, fantastic storyline with in my opinion the best ending of all final fantasys out there. Super glad this came to Steam, absolutely loved it."
Brilliant! Feels a lot better on PC than previous games which were reintroduced to PC.
Finally its here. Feels like back in the days. Very good port like FF 7 or FF 8. Sadly no widescreen setting but still a 10/10.
One of the best Final Fantasy games. Really good port.
"This is by definition what a Final Fantasy game should be aiming for.   Final Fantasy IX is the pinnacle of JRPGs. The game starts in an excellent way, similar to Final Fantasy VII puts the player into action and involved in important events for the story avoiding any chance to bore the player with tutorials, boring dialogs or non sense walking around.  If there is anything that could be improved that would be the mid to end story. The thing seems a bit rushed/non sense at some point but nothing too bad."
An old school final fantasy with a homage to even older final fantasy titles! This game has everything in a FF game that you could wish for..and possibly even more :)  +Card Game +Chocobos +Airship +Overworld map +Abundance of interesting characters +Fu***d up evil villans  +God tier ost  -Dodgy haircut by the princess  okay play this game.   Bye. 
"Eat frogs, get a powerful fork, kill dragons. What else would you want from a game?  A lot of people seem to have errors, but they might well be patched. I have no problems so far, the game is even better than I remember it, I'm really enjoying replaying.  Do I recommend this game? Hell yes! With the fantastic cutscenes we come to expect from Final Fantasy, A huge world to explore, be it by foot, airship or chocobo! A rusty knight clanking behind you and a lovable little black mage, there will be few dull moments!"
"Compared to the PS1 version it's a lot cleaner, much easier to see items and characters against the background and the menu system looks and feels way better. Being able to skip cutscenes is really useful, but this made me notice how long the non-FMV cutscenes really are; a lot of mashing X.  I'm not entirely sure this is worth it's full price over the PS1 version, (assuming you already have it) but it saves a lot of hassle trying to set up the PS1 and looks much closer to how your brain remembers it did. Wait for a sale probably, the game isn't gonna change between now and then. A little tweaking could be also very valuable - deadzones on controllers in particular, I found myself automatically running back between screen edges because the game thought I was holding a direction.  Recommended for it's graphics and its faithfulness to the source material."

"The Fantastic-  -An actual native port of one of the most beloved games in the Final Fantasy series. The graphics look fantastic, it plays smooth, the horrible 'wobbly' textures and warping of models as seen in the PSX version is gone, gone gone. Attention to detail has actually been undertaken to make this game a rare gem for me to play.  The Good- It's got cheats, or 'boosters' yes they will come in handy but I've always been a fan of the grinding, so I won't be using these but I can see other players might like to use them.  The Bad- Controller support is woefully inadiquite. The Xinput plugin for unity used is way, way out of date and lackluster. The Backgrounds, although I know myself they have been replaced with higher resolution versions than the PSX, they stand out really bad on higher resolutions.  The plain ugly- Where do I start? First of all an older version of unity has been used making the game prone to game-stopping bugs (which I will report below). There's zero graphic customization, there's a horrible aspect ratio fix and ugly grey bars, forcing me to create my own mod just so I can enjoy the game, you know, so it stretches to my screen. Heck a PSX emulator can do better. But don't fear, my mod for this is up on the guides section in the community. Although it has been claimed that the movies are 'HD' the one at the start (where vivi walks around and the alexandria text comes in) is plain awful. Pixellated, blotchy, low res rubbish. At least use a slight blur and a sharpen Square to get rid of this. And why the heck are the movies been renamed to .btyte when they are clearly theora? Why make it so hard for the modder community to improve a classic game further?  And the big one. The game, for some, doesnt work. Period. Getting into the first battle is impossible for some and the music plays, but your world will go black. And here's why.  I was able to reproduce the issue people have been having, it seems it's related to a really dogdy plugin that square enix made for this game, called FF9SpecialEffectPlugin.dll, it's in the Plugins folder. A look in a hex editor at it mentions bones, SFX and framebuffer effects. Deleting this plugin results in what people have described, cant get into the first fight, the music plays but the screen is black. This is definately what is causing the problem. Square if you are reading this fix your buggy plugin or should I do it for you?!!!  All in all, I do recommend this game as it is *almost* a vast improvement on the PSX version. However, Square, you need to fix all these bugs, upgrade your unity version, allow people to mod your game more easily (this is 2016, not 1996 anymore) and stop treating your PC fans like idiots.  Buy for the price and the possibility of this getting fixed but steer clear if you want to play now."
"The ultimate RPG experience, perfect in every aspect."
This is the greatest game ever made.
"9 hours and i still cant get past the skipping mini game. man i was so much better as a 12 year old  *Update* fixed my pad and beat the mini game, 10 hours later and my saves have vanished. back to skipping I go :*("
Fantastic Final Fantasy game. Fantastic PC port.  Buy this.
One of the best entries of the series
"Arguably the best Final Fantasy in the series. If you've never played FF before, I recommend you start with this one."
"God, I missed this game. I used to own it on the PS1 and it was great fun then. In my opinion, this is the best of the final fantasies. I admit I am biased as this was also my first Final fantasy game, but I do prefer it over FF7 and 8, though not by much...if they remade FF7 with FF9 graphics or better, it would win...but until the fabled FF7 HD remake comes, FF9 is top game.  Its a game any Final fantasy fan will enjoy...even if the chocographs in the 'hot &amp; cold' minigame are sanity erodingly annoying..."
"Great JRPG classic for any fan of the genre. I'm only going to review the port, because the game is just as solid as when it was first released and there are thousands of better reviews out there.  The port is pretty good. Quick loading times, smooth transitions, no input delays and 60 FPS. The soundtrack was also not touched unlike in FF8 so you get to hear it in its full awesomeness.  There are some added features that can help you out a lot mainly for achievment grinding/hunting and give you some extra variety to play around while remaining completly optional. The UI is very mobile oriented (since they also did a port for android) but only noticable during the main menu and battle scenes, apart from that looks very clean and polished. And finally it supports xbox controller pretty well."
"After 16 years I am finally able to play this game.  This was something that I originally looked at in 2000 when it was released, but I didn't have the money or the console to play it. Now I can finally say I have played Final Fantasy I thru XIII (not the sequels yet) (except for the online version FF XI).  This particular generation of FF is dear to me; I'm speaking about VII, VIII, and IX, the ones released on the original Playstation. There is a lot of charm in the prerendered backgrounds, the simple Active Time Battle system, and also the story and characters.  FF IX features a different model style than of it's previous two games. I've heard it being called ugly by some critics, but do not judge this game by its looks. There is a lot to do in the world of Gaia, and the majority of it is enjoyable.  What I do not enjoy about this game is Chocobo Hot-and-Cold. It's a minigame that's essential to earning valuable items, and it does get tedious very quickly. I also do not enjoy TetraMaster, the card game that's a evolution of VIII's card game. You'd have to play it many times before understanding what the rules are, especially the numbers on the cards, before you can start winning. Even then, it's easy to lose. It's not the most friendly minigame to new players.  Now, another feature of these games is the grinding for EXP/AP. I know most people do not enjoy repetitive battles. I, on the other hand, like the lethargic task. Frankly, it's calming to me and I can't explain why. But this is indeed a game for people who like that sort of gameplay; definitely not for gamers who want to rush things. With this port however, you have readily available options to max out everything so you can enjoy the story without the need for grinding.  However, despite the minigame flaws, the overall game is very enjoyable. It's easy to get sucked into the story and gameplay with these games, and IX is no exception. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the PS1 period of JRPGs."
"Really great game for all, but especially for fantasy-oriented people. I imagine that FFIX is held in a special place in the hearts of many. This might be due to the harry-potter-esque setting in a magical world of crystals, pointy hats, knights, princesses, kingdoms, bad queens, evil beings, to even more evil deities, and having to overcome those through the power of love and friendships. With a more intricate story line, character developments, and 3D perception, consider FFIX a degree higher in the aforementioned qualities than previous and earlier forms in the Final Fantasy Series. After all, these qualities are what made Final Fantasy what it is to begin with. To derail from this, as other games later in the series have done, is to dampen the quality of FF origins. Simply put, FF was never the same after this game. This marked the end of a generation, but as the market evolved, so did the company. All we can do is to hold this game as a treasure, and appreciate it for what it is.   In memorium: Final Fantasy IX  I played this game for the art, music, characters, and story line. Didn't really see any difference between the PS1 version, except for the enhancement options, which made the game super easy. What I recommend, if like me, don't have much time anymore to play countless of hours, simply do max level, max gil, and master abilities. Use the cheat where you don't encounter monsters, and you will get to enjoy the game without the level grind. It is like being in a drama, or a book, where you get to control the character, and see their developments."
"My favorite Final Fantasy now on PC and in HD,Square enix been doing a good job on port,kudos to them. XD"
One of my favourite games of all time and the steam port is a legitimate decent port. No funky changes.
just took them 16 years to release it on PC! yay was back in the day a great game and so it still is
"Played it for the first time and enjoyed it a lot, but the dumb 'YOU NEED THE STRATEGY GUIDE' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hooks from the original game are ♥♥♥♥ing obnoxious. Still, great old-style RPG with a fun story and cast."
"One of my favorite games from the psx era! finally on PC. havent had any crashes or problems at all, xbox 360 controller working great for the game."
"Buy it. Buy it despite the 16 year old background graphics.  The release is solid. It's stable. And it is an amazing game. If you have the money, and the time, get the game. If you've never played it, you are in for a treat. If you have played it already, you already know it's worth it.  I hate recommending a square-enix game. I do. But this is a Squaresoft game, not a Square-Enix game. So it's all good.  You won't be disappointed with this."
"While we all would obviously love a version of the game with the illustrious high quality backgrounds, this is a pretty solid port all-in-all. I was initially turned off by the idea of the 'tools' given to 'ease' the game, but found that having less patience as I aged meant getting rid of the needless grind in some places that was void of all challenge was quite welcome.  If you love the game, give it a shot. The port is done correctly. Only minor qualms I have is the UI being a bit too big since it was designed for mobile and Steiner's victory stance having some graphical clipping."
"can't bring myself to finish it because of how tedious the battles are. tedious compared to like, literally EVERY other FF titles.  also I got upset over not finding stuff due to 100% of the backgrounds being pre-rendered but that's just me being a baby."
"I wanted to wait until i got sufficiently far into the game to make sure that everything was as it should be, and, having gotten into the 3rd disc, everything has far surpassed my expectations.    For New Players"
An old school final fantasy with a homage to even older final fantasy titles! This game has everything in a FF game that you could wish for..and possibly even more :)  +Card Game +Chocobos +Airship +Overworld map +Abundance of interesting characters +Fu***d up evil villans  +God tier ost  -Dodgy haircut by the princess  okay play this game.   Bye. 
Personal favorite final fantasy :D Amazing story and battle system ! :) highly recommend it !
Gorgeously fantastic.
my favorite childhood game. it`s still amazing !
"This game is so good, I fall asleep playing it"
10/10 would name Garnet Garnet again
"I am satisfied with the upgrades to IX while keeping the original state! Final Fantasy is my favorite RPG and will be that way because of these classics.  ---  Sidenote I have gotten 2 crashes so far when switching scenes and engaging battle with the Plant Brain boss. I have gotten reports of the errors if someone can help me, I would really like to play through without constantely saving because my game might crash."
"Overall: Good Enough. At least we have it.  Straight up, this is what is going on.  1. This is a mobile adaption, no widescreen, you get the same borders you get with mobile. OK. 2. Right off the bat, the controller scheme was messed with. What made FFIX unique was in that it used X as select and O as cancel by default, or A and B if using Xbox controller. I feel the developer totally was clueless about this. 3. Dialogue changes: So far, the little girl with the cutsey soft vowels who bumps into Vivi now speaks perfect english. 4. Floating cup inside the tavern. 5. Battle is now clunky, they seem to think we wanted to keep 'Change' and 'Escape' and 'Defend' in the menu, so now it's extra wide. OK. Will get used to it. 6. Steal rate seems to be improved, tried several times after the mage masher and always got it within the first few tries. 7. Everyone who can play cards has the card icon over their heads when you approach them. OK.. I guess I'll survive it.  So far that's it for now. I hope some mods can tame down some of the more annoying things, but it's an acceptable port so far.   "
"Ok. First of all, let me say that Square did a GOOD job porting one of their PSX titles this time. Character Models look great, Menus look sharp and beautiful, and the added some shaders and stuff to make the pre-rendered backgrounds look better than the original. That being said, after waiting all these months for the PC release, I was kind of hoping they would find a way to add the original HD pre-rendered backgrounds that would've made the contrast between the hi-res models and the backgrounds less obvious. Also, I hate the fact that this is a port of the Android/IOS version, and that they didn't take the time to rework some parts for PC. I mean, who needs the battle menus to take half the screen on PC? Why 6 options instead of 4? Can't we use a BUTTON to defend/change?  Anyway, would of course recommend to everyone, as this is the best game ever released :P and the port is actually good!"
"tl;dr: Fantastic game, great port, 9/10.  I can't give this game enough props. Everyone speaks about that one game that defined them, or their childhood. This is THAT game for me. Everyone who has played this game sings the same tune: you can't beat FFIX. It's so charming and the story is so intriguing. The charcters are relatable and engaging, and you'll find yourself engrossed in the whole FFIX world from the off.  As a port - I can't fault it. It runs smoothly and flawlessly. I was curious as to why the game needed the Android SDK before release. I can now see that it's so you can click the mouse on the screen to make your charcter move in that direction - smart. I imagine this adds touchscreen functionality too, but can't confirm due to my lack of touchscreen. The original soundtrack is in this game which is a big plus for me personally: this soundtrack was easily Uematsu's finest work.  The upscaled and retextured character models look great, and the new battle/text interface looks really nice as well. The cutscenes have also clearly been remastered but not so much to the extent of the models.  However, having played the original PS1 game, and then again (several tens of times) on an emulator - I would not say this is the definitive version. Though the new charcter models look nice - the pre-rendered backgrounds have not been changed, and the two graphics fidelities do clash sometimes. Not only that, but some sounds effects that weren't there in the original game have been added (one in a cutscene, which I won't spoil but it does kind of ruin the mood a bit).  That said, these are only very minor issues which for me only detract from the game slightly. I am throughly looking forward to playing this one through again, and strongly recommend it for those who have not yet played it."
"As an avid fan of the Final Fantasy series as a child until the present, I can safely say this is one of my favourite games of all time. This game starts off with the main protagonist Zidane being reunited with his old thief buddies and thief group Tantalus. He finds himself hatching a master plan with his group to kidnap the beautiful and beloved princess of the mighty kingdom of Alexandria, who turns out to want to be kidnapped. From there, we realize her mother, the caniving old hag, Queen Brahne of Alexandria finds out and sends out all sorts of crazy, malicious creatures to try and capture the princess and return her to Alexandria as soon as possible. However, the princess and Zidane's company have other things in store and the story of this game and the true intentions of Queen Brahne unfold beautifully from there.   Here is a breakdown of this game and why if you haven't played an FF or even this game before, you need to quickly do so:   Story 9/10  - Pretty much flawless, minus a few hiccups that could have been explained better mainly at the end of the game. See the above paragraph for a detailed explanation. Needless to say Zidane's antics will keep you on the edge of your chair and you will see how the story unfolds from different perspectives (good and evil).    Characters 9/10   - There are eight playable characters that are consistent throughout the whole game (given the fact you have to search for some of these characters yourself), you will have some intermittent characters who you will team up with as a nice addition to this. The characters have lots of depth, they all have a connection to the story, they all have different relationships with each other some dysfunctional, some in the name of love etc. They all have different in game purposes (you have a white mage, summoner, monk, thief, soldier/warrior, black mage, blue mage, dragoon) they use magic, throw items, summon eidolons, steal rare equipment from bosses, heal your party, use strong offensive magic, use defensive magic, the list goes on.    Music 10/10   - Well if you aren't familiar with Nobuo Uematsu's work then you have been missing out on some sublime video game music. This man is a genius and pretty much every score he has ever written sounds beautiful to these old ears. Honestly, i'd go as far as to say the soundtrack alone could keep you playing this game, you hear songs of sadness, songs of despair, songs of struggle, songs of happiness, songs of confusion, songs of reflection etc. A lot of this music could pull me out of the deepest, darkest hole in my life. Perfection.    Gameplay 9/10   - Of course this is a PSX-era JRPG, therefore the main system is the turn based fighting system that all of us FF fans know and love. You take turns at issuing commands in battle and you can use different abilities (black magic, physical attacks, sword magic etc) and you plow away at an enemy until their Hit Points (HP) reaches 0, or in some boss battle cases you just have to survive a certain amount of turns to win. At the end of the battle you are awarded experience points (EXP), ability points (AP) and gil (in game money), however boss battles do not award EXP unlike in some FF games. A simple, yet rewarding system. You can go from town to town, dungeon to dungeon via the world map screen, where you can explore four different continents. You will meet loads of different characters on your travels, complete loads of sidequests and find all of the best equipment and cards if you choose to do so.    Finally...replay value 10/10   - I thought i'd add in this section because it is one of the most important things about this game. FFIX has a ton of replay value if you enjoy this game like I do, completing this game once is not enough in my opinion. Did you get the gold chocobo? Did you get all of the ultimate weapons? Did you kill all of the secret bosses? Did you complete all of the sidequests? Did you get the Excalibur II sword? There are many reasons to go through this great game again. There are ways you can challenge yourself such as doing solo party member runs, doing low level runs and doing a speedrun of this game.    Overall score: 9/10 "
Plays game. Yep jump rope minigame still impossible as hell. falls on face/10
"One of my favorite games from the psx era! finally on PC. havent had any crashes or problems at all, xbox 360 controller working great for the game."
Personal favorite final fantasy :D Amazing story and battle system ! :) highly recommend it !
"Why you care about small things? World very simple place. World only have two things: Things you can eat and things you no can eat.  Wonderful game, you should get it."
"Getting a chance to break my keyboard instead of my ps controller and calling it a ♥♥♥♥ game cos I suck at jumprope and tetra master 10/10.  But seriously, probably the best Final Fantasy ever made. Epic story, very good gameplay, every character has something to add to the game and story, nothing (for a change) feels like it is redundant or not as polished as it should be.  If you are a big FF fan, this is the one to play, if you've never been much of a fan of the FF franchise, this is still the one to play.  A bit different to the original game, new UI, added (pointless to me) game boosters. Use them if you feel like it, you will never regret it if you don't use them.  Controls feel a lil clunky versus the PS version, permanent original aspect ratio 9which pisses my OCD off badly), but hey, who gives a ♥♥♥♥, it's Final Fantasy IX on PC finally XD.  Worth the buy, worth the play, no matter how good or bad the port."
"Oh thank god. This is everything I was hoping for and more. All the little tweaks they've added definitely improve the experience on FFIX. If you have friends who haven't played this, now is definitely the time.   Good: The game's sprites look awesome!! I love the new unit graphics! An icon letting you know if someone's willing to play cards with you! GENIUS! Click to move! ...Sort of! The new battle screen is really cool!  Bad: Click to move sometimes has a hard time transitioning to a different map.  Ugly: Everything other than the characters and new battle effects. The scenery and such still feels blurry and out of focus, but at least for me, this is minor.  Definitely a thumbs up."
"I am satisfied with the upgrades to IX while keeping the original state! Final Fantasy is my favorite RPG and will be that way because of these classics.  ---  Sidenote I have gotten 2 crashes so far when switching scenes and engaging battle with the Plant Brain boss.

"Final Fantasy 9... It's nostalgic to play the game again. Okay, to business.  First of all, look at my playtime on steam (negligable at the moment) and multiply it by a thousand and you MIGHT have my total played hours. Back in the day when the game originally came out, I must have played, and replayed it at LEAST a dozen times. Each time having several hundred hours. Over the years I played the game again but with more time in between but still, I can play it through blindly and usually without dying too much. I know which levels I should have (roughly) but nevertheless I know everything there is to know about the game.  I'm not going to bother to go over the graphics. The game is from the year two thousand so its well over a decade old. You can't expect the game to look pretty compared to modern games.  music / sound The music is awesome. The songs and music of final fantasy nine are perfect and don't get on your nerves too quickly. Of course, if you let the game on loop then it might be a bit much....  Plot When I played the game for the very first time, it was a gift for my tenth birthday. (I think) The thing is, I picked it because it had four cd's. But I absolutely NEVER regretted buying... well okay having the game bought for me (details) But seriously, I never regret getting the game or playing it. And again. And again.  Back then, I didn't have accesss to the internet, but I did have access to a walkthrough which did help me a lot. It told me how much hp enemies had and I must have died hundreds of times. I remember that I pulled the plug (after making sure I wouldn't lose too much progress) in frustration at least a dozen times.  So the question remains... Should you buy the game? Well it depends. For me, I bought it as soon as I realized it was available. I didn't hesitate for a  second.Why?  Because I know what I'm getting. I bought the game because I wanted to play it on pc. That was one reason. But I also wanted it because it's one of my favorite games of all times and well.. I can afford it so why not?  You, the prospect buyer should probably watch a few let's plays or a review (when it comes) before deciding if you should purchase or not. The game looks a bit prettier, and the models are updated, but I don't think anything was changed mechanic wise. Of course there are a few cheat options but you should only use that after finishing the game at least once.  Should you buy?  YES! Definetly but only after making sure you know what you're getting.  Kingdark"
"I've waited over 10 years for this game to be released on again, and Steam finally did. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this game. Everything from the smooth controls, to the stunning graphics, to the amazing sound, everything is perfect. It's reliving my childhood in modern age. This is my favorite game of all time, and I can't think of a thing to that can be improved about this game. Also, disregard the negative comments and reviews of this game. All of them are about how their game controllers don't work. That's because the game doesn't have full controller support, so it's not going to work fully."
Still an enjoyable story from when I used to play it on consol. Though the boost definitly increase replayability.
Personal favorite final fantasy :D Amazing story and battle system ! :) highly recommend it !
One of my favourite games of all time and the steam port is a legitimate decent port. No funky changes.
"An enchanting experience that holds up 16 years later, Final Fantasy 9 has it all: stellar gameplay, lovely music, heart-warming characters, solid story, and a powerful theme that will have you begging to stay in such an amazing world."
An old school final fantasy with a homage to even older final fantasy titles! This game has everything in a FF game that you could wish for..and possibly even more :)  +Card Game +Chocobos +Airship +Overworld map +Abundance of interesting characters +Fu***d up evil villans  +God tier ost  -Dodgy haircut by the princess  okay play this game.

"I wanted to wait until i got sufficiently far into the game to make sure that everything was as it should be, and, having gotten into the 3rd disc, everything has far surpassed my expectations.    For New Players"
"I've saw some ppl talking about problems they have about this game, but myself, I dont have any. I've waited to play a little before making an evaluation for the game (I've saw some evaluation with less then 1h playtime...), I have 35 but in real I'm more about 25h.  If you never played FFIX and you like (j)RPG, you need to try this game at least once, this game is so great, the combat system, the story, the OST (my favorite OST for a game), the characters, specially Vivi, Steiner and the princess, the only little thing I could say about this game, is the lack of post-game content, there is a few thing to do, but maybe they could have do more.  And if you already played FFIX, then it depend how much you liked it, maybe I love that game, that's why it's a good reason enough to buy it and play it again.  The only reason you should not buy it is, if you played it already and you didn't like enough (I dont understand how this can be possible...), or if you dont like RPGs.  I hope my evalution will help you to decide."
"Remember back when Square made good games that didn't involve the character cast looking like a k-pop boy band? And also didn't have character names as bland as eg: Vanilla, Snow, Lightning, Fang and other 8 year old choices? Back when the stories were rich and filled with drama, romance, combat, actual magic, hundreds of different races and species of humanoids and so forth? Back when the games gave you freedom to roam the map and do some side questing 'before' the halfway point in the game, or final disk.  With hundreds of treasure chests, secret treasures, easter eggs, mini games with rewards, tetra card matches, ATEs, and everything inbetween this game is fleshed out perfectly and has no plot holes or anything else hindering it's story.  This game will have you thinking about many things as you progress through the story and see how each main character's own growth changes. 10/10 P.S.  Square, release Chrono Cross on steam. You won't be disappoint. ;)"
"After 10 years of first being introduced to this game, I finally got the chance to actually finish it all the way through, and I have to say that it was an amazing experience. Memorable characters, fantastic storyline with in my opinion the best ending of all final fantasys out there. Super glad this came to Steam, absolutely loved it."
"This is one my favorite games in the FF series, I played it many times since its release back in 2000, it feels like the last true Final Fantasy before Square merged with Enix. While this is based off the Android version, the visuals are crisp, original soundtrack, models look great and controls are solid. Definitely recommend getting this for PC for sure :D"
"Arguably the best Final Fantasy in the series. If you've never played FF before, I recommend you start with this one."
One of the best entries of the series
This is the greatest game ever made.
"9 hours and i still cant get past the skipping mini game. man i was so much better as a 12 year old  *Update* fixed my pad and beat the mini game, 10 hours later and my saves have vanished. back to skipping I go :*("
"God, I missed this game. I used to own it on the PS1 and it was great fun then. In my opinion, this is the best of the final fantasies. I admit I am biased as this was also my first Final fantasy game, but I do prefer it over FF7 and 8, though not by much...if they remade FF7 with FF9 graphics or better, it would win...but until the fabled FF7 HD remake comes, FF9 is top game.  Its a game any Final fantasy fan will enjoy...even if the chocographs in the 'hot &amp; cold' minigame are sanity erodingly annoying..."
"Great JRPG classic for any fan of the genre. I'm only going to review the port, because the game is just as solid as when it was first released and there are thousands of better reviews out there.  The port is pretty good. Quick loading times, smooth transitions, no input delays and 60 FPS. The soundtrack was also not touched unlike in FF8 so you get to hear it in its full awesomeness.  There are some added features that can help you out a lot mainly for achievment grinding/hunting and give you some extra variety to play around while remaining completly optional. The UI is very mobile oriented (since they also did a port for android) but only noticable during the main menu and battle scenes, apart from that looks very clean and polished. And finally it supports xbox controller pretty well."
"After 16 years I am finally able to play this game.  This was something that I originally looked at in 2000 when it was released, but I didn't have the money or the console to play it. Now I can finally say I have played Final Fantasy I thru XIII (not the sequels yet) (except for the online version FF XI).  This particular generation of FF is dear to me; I'm speaking about VII, VIII, and IX, the ones released on the original Playstation. There is a lot of charm in the prerendered backgrounds, the simple Active Time Battle system, and also the story and characters.  FF IX features a different model style than of it's previous two games. I've heard it being called ugly by some critics, but do not judge this game by its looks. There is a lot to do in the world of Gaia, and the majority of it is enjoyable.  What I do not enjoy about this game is Chocobo Hot-and-Cold. It's a minigame that's essential to earning valuable items, and it does get tedious very quickly. I also do not enjoy TetraMaster, the card game that's a evolution of VIII's card game. You'd have to play it many times before understanding what the rules are, especially the numbers on the cards, before you can start winning. Even then, it's easy to lose. It's not the most friendly minigame to new players.  Now, another feature of these games is the grinding for EXP/AP. I know most people do not enjoy repetitive battles. I, on the other hand, like the lethargic task. Frankly, it's calming to me and I can't explain why. But this is indeed a game for people who like that sort of gameplay; definitely not for gamers who want to rush things. With this port however, you have readily available options to max out everything so you can enjoy the story without the need for grinding.  However, despite the minigame flaws, the overall game is very enjoyable. It's easy to get sucked into the story and gameplay with these games, and IX is no exception. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the PS1 period of JRPGs."
"Really great game for all, but especially for fantasy-oriented people. I imagine that FFIX is held in a special place in the hearts of many. This might be due to the harry-potter-esque setting in a magical world of crystals, pointy hats, knights, princesses, kingdoms, bad queens, evil beings, to even more evil deities, and having to overcome those through the power of love and friendships. With a more intricate story line, character developments, and 3D perception, consider FFIX a degree higher in the aforementioned qualities than previous and earlier forms in the Final Fantasy Series. After all, these qualities are what made Final Fantasy what it is to begin with. To derail from this, as other games later in the series have done, is to dampen the quality of FF origins. Simply put, FF was never the same after this game. This marked the end of a generation, but as the market evolved, so did the company. All we can do is to hold this game as a treasure, and appreciate it for what it is.   In memorium: Final Fantasy IX  I played this game for the art, music, characters, and story line. Didn't really see any difference between the PS1 version, except for the enhancement options, which made the game super easy. What I recommend, if like me, don't have much time anymore to play countless of hours, simply do max level, max gil, and master abilities. Use the cheat where you don't encounter monsters, and you will get to enjoy the game without the level grind. It is like being in a drama, or a book, where you get to control the character, and see their developments."
"A classic! Was the game that got me into Final Fantasy and RPGs in general. Memorable characters, music and story make this game a must play! They even adressed one of the few issues people had with this game with this port (battle speed)!"
"One of my favourite games from this series. Characters are great, music is amazing and gameplay is hella fun. For me, it's one of the best JRPG's ever made."
The best soundtrack of all time.
"This is simply my favourite FF game, finished it 3 times on my old PS1 and once again on steam. 10/10 would replay again!"
It's the best one. Really. If you haven't played it before now's the time.
Classic JRPG that I would recommend to anyone.
"This is a great game.  I remember playing it in ps1 and when I fishined it feeling like the grestest person in the world. To this day this is the only Final Fantasy that I have finished 100% with every optional thing done.  So, in conclusion buy it."
  The most underrated game in the franchise has finally gotten the port it deserved. A well-deserved one! It was nice to see they've kept everything we love about the game untouched; and the extra options included (such as auto-saving on screen changes and the cheats!) are very welcome! We can finally play Chocobo Treasure Hunt again!! (now with Steam Achievements!) 10/10
" My full review can be found on Final Fantasy and More.  [www.ffandmore.com]   Final Fantasy IX is a game that has always been near to my heart. As far as mobile to PC Final Fantasy ports go, Final Fantasy IX is extremely solid. If you want to play the game in any resolution besides 4:3 do note that there will be grey sidebars to 'fill in' the extra screen space. While the character models do generally look quite good, there are some ugly moments when they are put up against screens that weren't upgraded and still feature the old PSX graphics.  I highly suggest against playing this game with headphones, especially if you are sensitive to high pitch noises, as the sound effects are completely messed up. Some key ones, such as the noise for Trancing, will absolutely destroy your ears if you are playing with headphones.  If you are looking to pick up the game for the achievements, or have never played it before, then the Steam version is excellent for that. If you're happy with simply playing the PSX version then feel free to pass on this, or just wait until it is on sale and grab it then.  Disclaimer: I was provided a key for review purposes."
"This installment was my first taste of the FF franchise, way back in 2002. If you haven't played any of the Final Fantasy games, and you're interested in trying one, then I would highly recommend FFIX. Partly out of my own bias, but also because playing any of the later games would likely tarnish your appreciation for IX due to the differences in graphics and gameplay. The story is truly compelling. Each of the 8 main characters whom you control has their own backstory, their own opinions, values and their own obstacles to overcome... even Quina, although he/she is mostly motivated and preoccupied by food. The character development of Zidane and co. is diffcult to rival! The OST (at least in my opinion) is still something special; especially when you're exploring Burmecia or when Kuja is around. I know it doesn't seem like I've played it much but I must've clocked in well over 1,000 hours of my life into this game back on the PS1! At a time when we had such gems as Metal Gear Solid 2, Star Wars: KotoR and Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy IX was still my favourite game. It was, and still is, so easy to lose yourself in this story."
I replayed this game about 20 times when it first came out and I was very happy to see it come out on Steam. It is a shame the backgrounds could also not be updated to match the models but the gameplay is still there and I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of old style Final Fantasy.
"Great port. Wish they had updated the backgrounds, but other than that it really is fantastic.   "
I did it. I finally beat my childhood  10/10 I'm crying inside
"I'm really enjoying the game so far. While it's just the fact my computer is a bit meh, I get lag on the FMV's, I can skip them and just continue with my game. Chocobo Hot and Cold still owns my soul as it always did before. Now onto my impressions. I'm very impressed with how the game looks. The backgrounds don't look awkward despite the new retextures of the characters, and I mean every character has been updated. Even the moogles look like they're fuzzy now. There are nice boosts that can be turned on and off if needed. In order to enjoy the game as its intended, I'd just use them when you're level grinding, and if you find the music repetitive while doing the grinding, you can turn the sound off and just put on your own music. Still as far as I've played this game is very faithful to the original, and it's been sorely missed. If you haven't tried it, I would STRONGLY reccomend this version over the psn version. The psn version is not optimized for widescreen tv's so it looks extremely pixely and does not do the game justice."
"As long as you aren't expecting a full HD remaster, I can recommend this game. As others have pointed out, Squaresoft decided to be lazy and only update the character models to HD quality but not really any of the backgrounds or the map. I found it really distracting at first, but after a bit I stopped noticing it and was able to focus on the game just fine. It looks weird, but the game still plays great (mostly, sometimes it can be hard to navigate the with the backgrounds being kind of blurry if you have this running in a window set to 1080p). So keep your expectations set accordingly and you'll probably enjoy this port.  Also not sure why it is showing me as having played only a few minutes—I played for over 2 hours today, but in offline mode."
"Before you judge this game, keep in mind that this was originally released more than 16 years ago. Some of the content will reflect that.   The game itself is a great game. I've played it a lot over the years on the PS1. It was my first Final Fantasy and it's also one of my favorites in the series. The music is beyond amazing, and even the tracks that isn't amazing is still great. For it's time, the game looked amazing. That obviously doesn't hold up to today's standards, but if you can keep an open mind and remember that this game is old, then it probably won't be much of an issue. The game ration is 4:3, gameplay is locked at 30 FPS and cutscenes runs in 15FPS. (They look smooth, though!) Gameplay-wise it's pretty much the same as older Final Fantasy games, and it plays nicely. (Do yourself a favor and turn the ATB speed to max.)  There's only two issues I truely have with this game. The first one is most important, and that is the wonky controller support. I can't use my controllers for this game, because if I do, I'll walk to either the left or the right without pressing any buttons. The other thing I can complain about is the lack of audio settings. The music in the game is fantastic, but it's a bit loud. The only settings you have for audio is music / no music and sound effects / no sound effects. You can't adjust the volume itself at all.   Overall, the game itself, as it's original release way back on the PS1, I'd rate it 10/10.  This port, however, I would rate a 7/10. There's a few things missing and the controller issue is a really big deal. Despite this, I will recommend this game."
Now all three of the best PS1 games can be played on Steam!
I've been waiting for the release all this time and I guess it's safe to say that expectations have been met.
"I recommend this port mostly for those who haven't played it yet, this is because it still holds up as one of the best FF games SS/SE has ever made (and is my personal favorite). I haven't found anything about this port that severely detracts from the overall game experience.  That being said they could (and should) have done a better job with some things. If you have a PS1 version that still works on a machine I would recommend just playing that again.  PROS - Being on PC for availability sake - Music is still great - Overall game flow is still good - The new HD models are nice, and the re-rendered cutscenes more-or-less hold up at 1920x1080 - Cloud Save points at the start of every new screen (basically whenever the screen goes black and has to load) for people who like that type of thing or forget to save frequently. - A few cheats to make the game easier (or harder) for people who may like that stuff  MIXED - Adjusted Text - The new font used for the game is changed to be more clear with the HD format, however the style could have been better chosen -Menu layouts could have been better, some functions are too deep in the menu flow when they should have been more accessible (like quit). Also it would have been nice to have the option to quit at any point in time through the in game pause menu.   CONS - While the Pre rendered still have a gorgeous design, they didn't receive the HD treatment - Some of the dialogue scenes will inexplicably pause for extended periods of time before finally catching up with themselves, so the game has some bugs that could still be ironed out. - There's not really a huge incentive for people who already have the game in some form to rebuy it, even at the 20 dollar price -- it would be nice to have a place to view previous cutscenes, concept art and other such things."
"I used to love JRPGs. NOW THEY MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE. Regardless of this tragic change of face, Final Fantasy IX will forever hold a special place in my heart. I first played FFIX as a young, fresh faced 19 year old boy. I was very much in love with a beautiful Naive girl whose mother happened to be a crack cocaine addict (she stole my copy of Hells Angels by Hunter S. Thompson, probably so she could buy more crack via pawnshop). Unfortunately, my love was unreciprocated which caused me many sleepless nights due to the puddle of tears drenching my pillow, but I digress. Final Fantasy IX revolves around a half monkey/half man named Zidane. He repeatedly gets shot down by a hot princess with a fat, disgusting mother. I could relate, let me tell you. It also has a little wizard boy in it that I'm going to make my son cosplay as when I make my family go to things they don't want to go to (I'm going to go as Black Waltz 3 because I'm hardcore like that). Kuja, the villain, made me question my sexual preferences, and after replaying the game I can confidently say he still does. There's also Eiko, who reminds me of my girlfriend, because she's young and hor…ribly cute…  Anyway, here’s an apt metaphor to close this out: Final Fantasy IX is like the last spoonful of Lucky Charms that has marshmallows in it, and the rest of the bowl is just milk and the non-marshmallow components of Lucky Charms. But then the milk is an MMO. And the non-marshmallows have an awkward laughing scene. And your spoon is very linear. And the bowl is a bad sequel. Let’s put the marshmallows back in the bowl folks. Let’s buy Final Fantasy IX.  Sincerely;  A fat white Canadian with a computer. "
"It's finally here, the PC port I've wanted for years and I'm glad to say it's a perfectly decent port.  First of all, Final Fantasy 9 is one of my top games of all time. Not only was it my first Final Fantasy (which raised the bar pretty high for all the games I played afterwards) it's my first PSX game, the first I completed and definitely the game I put the most time into back in the day. I feel this is a gem that has been sadly overlooked between the success of FF7 and the first on the PS2, FF10. However, as the last Final Fantasy on PSX it did everything right.  The story is fantastic, even revisiting this I'm left happy, sad, emotional and I'm seeing small things I missed as a child. The characters are so full of life, the way they interact with each other is really genuine. The banter between Zidane and Steiner is really funny and the sincerity with Vivi and Freya is really strong. Overall, it's one of the best storytelling games I've played and goes from a fairly light hearted premise to some pretty heavy themes.  Music is AMAZING. Nobuo Uematsu has called this game his masterpiece and he's right, the sound is so memorable and it all really fits the setting. I've had the soundtrack to this game since the first release and I always go back to it for some nostalgia.  Gameplay is hard to rate because it's an old FF game and they're reknowned for being a bit slow paced, however the port does improve this with some settings to speed up the battles and to turn off encounters if you want. Otherwise it's the same as before and I quite enjoy the battles. FF9 is the only PSX game with 4 characters, and this makes the battles much better in my opinion. The Trance system is still annoying because you can't control when it pops, so losing at the end of the battle means you can't save it for an important fight, but oh well. The equipment and ability system is really nice though, it actually gives you a good reason to keep your old items becuase you learn your abilities and passives this way. It's very simple and works really well.  The only thing I can find wrong with the Steam version is that the pre-rendered backgrounds are blurry as ♥♥♥♥. However this is nothing new for FF ports, there's not much that can be done because they're pre-rendered and animated 16 years ago and it's a tall order to re-make them. FMV cutscenes are the same ones and their framerate is a measly 15 fps, which is a bit jarring in this day and age, but again not much can be done. It's an old game, you'll have to take it in your stride.  I'm so happy this game is released and I thoroughly recommend. Now I just hope I can defeat Ozma this time around.."
"Great Game, 10/10 would play again"
OST stays original! 10/10 for nostalgic music from Nobuo Uematsu!
"I loved playing this game as a kid and this game got me into the FF series.  The characters and cinematics look amazing, not all the backgrounds have been buffed to HD but it's not bad. The 4:3 ratio adds grey borders to the side of the game on widescreen but it hasn't bothered me at all. They added achievements, some kind of autosave/checkpoint thing (left game without saving, could continue from where I left), boosters (cheats if you really want to use em), new UI (it's different than the original but I like it),...  This game was beautiful back in the day and now it is again. I think it has a great story and it's fun to play. If you're into story-rich rpg with turnbased combat, you should get this game (or if you're like me and loved this game back then, you should get it too :P ) Thanks Square Enix, for bringing back a great childhood memory. :)"
"I'm a big fan of FFIX, and is one of my favorite games, my favorite FF. The PC port was well done, nice keyboards and mouse inputs adaptation.  The HD models in game are awesome, they upgraded most of the cutscenes to HD too, all the enemies and tetra cards, and some scenario models.  Unfortunately, almost all scenarios' background were left untouched, but the graphic's upgrades are still awesome. Also, all the HUDs icons were updated and are beautiful now. The interface that now shows which NPCs wants to card battle is another subtle but awesome change. The game boosters are nice if you want to play it fast, but, IMO, this game is too good to be played the fast way. I love this game, and this port made it even more beautiful than it was in the PSX. 9/9 If you want to play the best RPG game of your life, just buy. Don't need to think twice."
"It plays quite well so far. The Ratio gets a little getting use to. I had an issue with my controller double clicking, however the fix was start the game with keyboard only until it talked about the controls and you could change it in the obtions and all worked fine. The game looks way better than before, and the boosters are an added bonus for those that don't want to grind all day. The jump rope still pisses me off, the models are crisp and clean. This is my favorite FF out of 7-14, and I remember why now. it is worth the price at admistion and worth another look at the world and characters I loved so much. So far 7/10 still worth it amongst my issues with it."
Finally! Finally on pc.
A good port. The game runs well and there are options to change the resolution. Of course its a port of a psone game so don't expect the backgrounds to change. The user interface is fine to use on a PC and doesn't feel like compromised tablet or smartphone port at all. It's a solid PC port and a great game.
"I'm playing Final Fantasy IX for the second time in my life. When I first started playing, I was a year older than Zidane Tribal, the energetic young protagonist. Now I'm a year younger than the grumpy knight Adebert Steiner. It's been a long while, but this game is a good port and an actually good update, with HD assets, added achievements and new feautures such as an autosave."
"The port is not perfect (e.g. monster encounter frequency seems to be less, sometimes intro scenes into fights don't show up correctly, and of course the grey bars on the sides are a bit irritating at first). After a few hours of gameplay this is totally forgotten!  Dive into ultimate nostalgia, if you have already played and loved this game on the playstation, or give it a go as a player experiencing earlier FF titles for the first time. I have played VII, VIII, IX and X+X-2. This installment will always be my favorite. The character development and storytelling is just magical, and the plot twists keep you guessing for a long time what's actually behind all of it.  The Achievements make it more fun to play especially for people who have already completed it earlier. Some seem to be a bit buggy, though, so watch out if a progress bar isn't working while you progress through the game."
Pretty good god damn port. If you liked the original no reason why you shouldnt enjoy this one.
How to relive an amazing childhood.
"One of the best jrpg's ever made finally released to Steam. I do recommend this version, even though i like the PSX version better. While the port isnt bad, it definetly could be better. Im waiting for this game to patch up and for mods to be released to enchance the experience alot further.   +85 Achievements ! Pretty fantastic i'd say (Also steam trading cards). +Mods that will make this port good. +Loading time is better. +Few of the boosters are good like battle speed and the No Encounter for lv1 playthrough.   -Cant press quit unless you go to the config menu ?? -Game still has the same glitches from the PSX verson (Thunder Slash etc) -Character models are way too flashy and dont fit into the environment. -Audio is pretty bad,especially when playing the card game, it's ringing in my ears ! -Bad analog controls (Been fixed so its still not as good as PS1 but it works for me at least. -The same pop-up that comes when looking for items and something interesting pops up when meeting people, which is annoying because im trying to find items D:    So to sum up, FFIX is a fantastic game, especially on the PSX and with PS emulators to enhance the graphics with the best mods available. This port feels very lazy but its FFIX on PC for crying out loud. By far one of the best jrpg's ever made, and rpg's in general."
"About damn time this came out onto PC, many aren't aware but this was the only Final Fantasy Playstation Original Era that never ever had a PC version up until now. It is nice to play and see this game again in a touched up experience. It is also the only Final Fantasy that had music that told the story along with the novel based writing in such a beautiful intertwined fashion that its basically a speechlees Opera which isn't too far off from the games main point visually.  Go and buy it and findout why some consider this to be textbook example on how to story tell a game story without speech and only based on visuals, opera music and writing.  Now if square considered putting Xenogears on steam in HD I would die a happy old man."
"First off, what are the 'issues' (if you think of them as one)  Controller Support - you have to do it yourself (3 minutes should suffice) Cinematics are in 4:3 (well who cares... really)  and thats it. really. This game was ported well. Very well. Naive support of HD+ resolutions, very good controls, upscaled graphics. While the backgrounds do look a little washed out, this comes from the original game and can't be fixed without a complete overhaul of the game.  For the game itself. If you haven't played it back then, play it now. The storytelling is superb, the characters are likeable and well thought out, all of them will progress in character in their adventure. At the end of the game you will love them all. The combat and exploration are classical, but there are some differences to the other FFs. Every character has his own 'class' and can only use his skills, While there is something like the 'perfect' lineup it's not required to overcome the game, so you can play with whom you like.  The mini-games (cards and treasure search with the chocobo) are as time-consuming as they are fun. So you lean back and enjoy 40hours+ of one of the best jrpgs ever made."
"Final Fantasy IX is here, and all that is old is new again. xx love it one of the best parts. xxx"
I failed to save Garnet q.q  And rope jumping is for those who have too much free time &lt;.&lt;
"+ Music is as good as before, not Midi like previous FF games here on Steam + So far, controller support seems perfect (X360 controller) + Battles can trigger faster and that is completely amazing, makes everything better + Great visuals, polished and clean  FF9 was among my top 5 in the series back then, and still is today. So happy they didn't botch it"
"This GAME is my childhood. impressive magic graphic (till now still amazed me), now with 1080p support, again i can learn the story all over again. If you are having a hard time, trust me, finish this game you will regain your positivity.  - No random encounter - great for enjoying the storyline  - God mode - personally if you couldnt take down Ozma, use this. - I am going to fully enjoy all the way to get Ark eidolon. SO COOL for dagger in trance mode - after seeing flare,flare star, holy and doomsday, Xlll magic is nothing."
'She's out cold' - Zidane
"Amazing game, I love it"
"This Final Fantasy is a love letter to all the previous titles in the series. If you've enjoyed FF3-8 on Steam, you'll likely enjoy this game, too.  It is a much slower paced game than other FF titles, and that's not the developers being lazy. The original varsion spanned 4 discs on the PS1, and had some of the best graphics the console had to offer.... Even though this caused some framerate issues at times.  That carries over to the Steam Version, too.  Pros about this game:  - Contoller support right out of the box. My 360 controller worked on this no problem, all inputs responded without issues or cumbersome configuration. - Noticably improved graphics. This isn't just a simple remake, more like a remastered version of sorts. - Great soundtrack - A story that will keep you interested throughout most of it. - You can conquer this game at a surprisingly low level (If you know what you're doing)  Cons about this game:  - It's not a perfect port, notably with enemy sound effects. - Lindblum is the most boring place on Gaia. You will come to dread story plot-related visits to this place. - The options to cheat kind of break gameplay, I strongly suggest you play casually first and only turn cheats on as a last resort."
FINALLY!!! Now hoping for FFX and FFX-2! And ofcourse XII.
"Still has the same flaws as the PS version - long battle load times, etc.  Regardless, the best entry in the FF franchise,"
It's a pretty good classic. It's my childhood.
Perfect game. Perfect port.
"FFIX is what the other previous PSX ports should have been.  Videos are wow. Backgrounds got a decent upscale+filtering (some transparency on the layers could have been cleaned up more though)  Character models got a few more verts here and there, and the textures look like they got an uprez/median filter with some additional cleanup work.  If only I could avoid the stupid launcher as I have to use a mouse for that one part."
"Final Fantasy IX.   This will be an honest review, so if you're looking for a participant in the usual FF IX love fest...you might want to look elsewhere.   Played it when it came out. Finished it, never really gave it another glance. It lacked the panache of 4, 6, 7 and 8. It was just...a confluence of poor design choices being taped together like a bad collage.   It's not the worst Final Fantasy out there. That would be FF X-2. (Or, as I like to call it... Final Fantasy: The Hot Topic RPG).   But IX probably gets a lot of unwarranted love. It's a game pretending to be a JRPG without all of the more complex elements that made Square's previous RPG's so much deeper and intracate.   Final Fantasy IX is literally the most Americanized form of the Square RPG. As it was partially developed in Hawaii, with Americans...this is not at all surprising. The mechanics are dumbed down, the story is...fun, but drags you along. There are a lot of folks who love IX. That's cool. But it's not the best title in this franchise. Not the worst, but it approaches being truly terrible at times. If you have the resolve to push through...  The game would have been better, had IX not had so many plot holes. It would have been even a little better, if characters had more reasons for why they were doing what they were doing, and more defined....But more than that, for some of the most lovable characters, and for most of the set up they do....there's no payoff in the end. I won't spoil the story, only to say that...when you make your audience care about a character or characters......and then compare that character to a bunch of similar characters...and then don't resolve even 25% of that in the end....you fail at writing. FF IX is full of examples of really terrible character presentation and follow through. Way too many to list.   A lot of the story involves running to and fro for really trivial reasons. It gets to be a drag. There are highlights, like Eiko...but also characters who are shoe horned in...such as Amarant. He's really pointless filler.   It gets some things right too. Tetra Master is a much better card game than say, Triple Triad. The character design is really nicely done. It's just too bad they didn't make the best use of them. The antagonist of the game is only surface interesting. He's bad mostly for the sake of it. He offers none of the more dynamic and interesting behavior or motives of say...Sephiroth, Kefka, or even Ultimecia.   I bought the game simply for the sake of keeping my golden age FF collection going. I wanted to give it another chance, having played it years ago. While it is a visually stunning game at times...it's story is lacking, it's mechanics are really dumbed down, and It just feels like I am playing something held together at times by scotch tape and string.   I am giving it a thumbs up....if you like Final Fantasy games...it's a good buy. Good for a playthrough every 10 years or so. It's not a bad title...but the team who made it made plenty of choices that kept it from being great. If I could give it stars...it would get a 2.5 or 3 star rating."
"One of the better PC ports of a Final Fantasy Game that SE has done. The new HD Character Models on both Players and Enemies look great. The Battle system remains as solid as always. And it seems fairly untouched from its PS1 days. The Soundtrack sounds like its straight from the original and the Menus can be mouse driven if wanting to play with Keyboard also.  Only a couple gripes. The prerendered backgrounds look a little fuzzy at the higher resolutions, and the new models make this very apparant. And whilst able to play full screen at any res, it seems the Gameplay is limited to its 4:3 window.  If you can look past that though, its the same great game from the PS1, finally on PC. Pick it up if you haven't already"
10/10 would recommend to another friend

'She's out cold' - Zidane
"By far the best Final Fantasy PC port yet.  Specially for gamepad playing, it doesn't requires any weird button configuration like in FFVII or FFVIII.  Also allows to play with the mouse, while not my preferred, it does help going through the many menus for items and skills.  Having some odd crashes every now and then, but other than that it's working perfectly. I'm really happy that my favorite Final Fantasy received such a great work into porting."

First hour was making sure that I impressed 100/100 nobles and the queen to get the moon stone I forgot about the jump rope mini game looks like I gotta make a new game to do that now. Also The feel of losing Blank...why you do this to me square. This is a gem from my childhood and well worth the wait for the release. It is honestly my Favorite of the FF games to date.
"My wife use to sing the theme song to FF9 before we were married and living states away from one another, which alone makes this game one of my favorites. I still LOVE the story, however, and have been dying to play it since my PS1 broke.  Steam did a GREAT job with the updated HD graphics...still the same beautiful artwork, just a little more impressive. And if you are looking to get through the game fast, just to relive it, the cheats they offer compare to back when Gameshark ruled the consoles.  All around it's everything you use to play with a little bit more shine to it. 10/10."

"More first impressions than a full review.  Pros: The new UI actually looks pretty decent. Keeps the 4:3 aspect ratio, thus not stretching the picture. You need to remember that the game has pre-rendered backgrounds with entrances and exits, it wouldn't translate to 16:9 resolution. New character models look crisp, but more or less what you'd expect from a PS1 game in terms of graphics.  Cons: 30fps lock will put some people off. Personally it doesn't bother me in a turn based RPG, but ya know, PC Master Race and all that. ;) Exiting the game properly is a chore. You have to go into the config menu, scroll all the way down just to exit the game via the game menu. A simple quit button added to the first Y button menu's interface would be much easier.  An hour in, seems like a good port so far."
Perfect game. Perfect port.
"Best Final fantasy ever, and last decent final fantasy, what is there not to love?  The last of its kind before S.E. went nuts and delivered awful Final fantasy games. Vamo' alla flamenco! 10/10"
FINALLY!!! Now hoping for FFX and FFX-2! And ofcourse XII.
  amazing soundtrack and story
It's a pretty good classic. It's my childhood.

Go wild man keep copping feels when they have 'nothing' theres something.. right zidane? :) req: mod possible please enemy lose their pant after 20 x 'nothing' and they berserk status.

Quite simply the best Rpg of all time and well worth the buy.  Do yourself a favour and add to the basket :)
My Favorite Game Of All TIme This Port Is Decent Though I Wish Square Could Do Better
"This game is simply amazing, the best one from my childhood, but more importantly, I'll describe the port.  Great port, a lot more features than I expected. It not only has a fully mouse-compatible UI, but you can actually use the mouse to move and interact with the world. There are plenty graphical upgrades, mainly the character models, cutscenes and UI. The speed-up cheat and configurations are great, they solve the biggest problem this game has, being a bit too slow.  Overall, this port made the game better than the original, solved its biggest problem and works perfectly with mouse/keyboard."
"It's incredible. A port that is actually 100% playable without the need for a day one patch. The models look amazing I'm seeing details in characters I could never make out in the original. Fully supports Xbox controller mapping and the game runs smooth as silk. I honestly could not be happier.  I've you've never had a chance to pick up this underatted classic please do! And I will be honest, $20 is a fair asking price for this. The game just works and looks fantastic.  Clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank clank"
"This review is based on the FFIX port. If you want a review of the actual game, please look elsewhere.  The game worked fine right off the bat for me. No video or controller issues that others have mentioned.  New models look AMAZING! The sound is of great quality. The controls are exactly what you'd expect. The menus are bigger than they need to be but not a hinderance. The only gripe I have is that the backgrounds look pretty bad. Especially with the new models. Would have been nice if Square Enix could have updated them as well. But oh well.  This is a great port though. Well worth ~$20 in my opinion."
"Honorable nobles of steam, this way.....   FF9 is my favorite of the FF series! I live in China and have been waiting to play it again for so long XD   These pros and cons are for the Steam edition and not the storyline, gameplay mechanics, etc. As I have previously said, this is my favorite. O_____O FFIX can do no wrong in those departments for me.  Pros-  - Pausing cutscenes/any time really is fantastic baby.  - The UI is just fine for me (in reference to neg. reviews). It doesn't look all that different and I'm not all that picky tbh.  - Contoller working fine so far (xbox 360 wired) - General Beatrix - Button mapping for both Keyboard and controller always a plus - At first I thought the sound was off, but then I plugged in some decent headphones and realized it was my lappy speakers. So, the sound is pretty much as good as the original thus far.  - Continue option for busy on the go gamers or for those who must unexpectly stop playing is a huge bonus.  - Game boosters. I say this is positive because it is optional. I don't use them, but again, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ since they are optional. Its the same as when they added fast travel in Oblivion. ITS OPTIONAL, quit your ♥♥♥♥♥in'. And maybe at some point I will use them just to enjoy the storyline. Again, the continue option and this make those who are busy have a much easier time to enjoy the game.  - GENERAL BEATRIX &lt;333 mmmmmmmmm..........  - Indicator that tells you who is willing to play cards. Especially great for new players, so you dont need to waste time and ask everyone.   Neutral - The graphics updates are nice in general, but I also am perfectly fine with all the old graphics too.  - Bars on the side of the screens. Not horrible, but also not right.   Cons-  - That said, the graphical updates do contrast with the backgrounds which can be less appealing. I love the original look, but since they refurbished the characters for a higher quality it would have been nice to have matching backgrounds too.  - Button mapping should be before the start of the game at the initial title screen.  - Occasional slight pausing (not sure what that is called. Screen tearing?) during cutscenes that isn't game breaking, but does make the cutscenes look less fluid and smooth. Could be my PC or lack of V-sync option or whatever.  - Jumproping"
"Other reviewers have more eloquently stated this, but this is a rather delightful port of a classic. It should also be noted that this is my first time playing FFIX; I never got to play it on the Playstation (mine broke shortly before this game was released and I never went back to try it on my PS2 in later years, skipping right from VIII to X), so this is a rather enjoyable experience for me. I had the misfortune of purchasing FFXIII and have regretted it ever since; this is a refreshing return to when FF games were well-written and had relatable characters. Consequently, for me, this isn't some misty-eyed remembrance of gaming from 15 years ago; this is simply a thoroughly enjoyable throwback to a different age of RPGs.  The cons are few, namely the grey letterbox format due to the original game's 4:3 ratio (I'm using a 21:9 monitor) and the odd contrast of the new, high-quality character graphics with the filtered original backgrounds. The mouse and keyboard controls are a bit wonky, but managable (frankly, this is one of the few games where I would actually prefer a game pad). Oh, and the Tetra Masters minigame is kind of broken (I much prefer the one from FFVIII), in that it contains an element of chance that results in some cards winning or losing when they have no rights to do so.  Really, the above are the only things about this port which I consider not ideal. I have had no stability or performance issues (no, the game won't do 60 fps, so please stop whining about it being capped), though I understand that some folks have. The story is enjoyable, the characters are well-rounded, with charmingly (and believably) flawed personalities (I love to watch Steiner get so angry that he just gesticulates). The music is excellent, the cutscenes are gorgeous, and from what I've seen, the gameplay and combat is on par with the other FF game that came just before and after. On a final note, I had forgotten how nice it was to not have voiced characters.  In short, this is a welcome reminder of the golden age of Final Fantasy; not perfect, but quite satisfying. I recommend it."
Final Fantasy IX is almost perfect. The original music is still there &lt;3 The characters have been retextured and look amazing &lt;3 Only thing stopping it from being perfect is the low quality prendered backgrounds but mods will surely fix that.
"Queen Brahne was impressed.  Good job Square Enix. And good job the team that adapted the game for Steam and Tablet devices. You clearly loved this game and showed it the respect it needed. The blurred backgrounds are just the small stain on the coffee table that's otherwise expertly made, but I really can't fault you for that. Maybe in a future update, as I know it's a ridiculously harsh task to repaint the backgrounds to a higher quality.  All the additions and touch ups really put a smile to my face as this is without a doubt my defining final fantasy game, and god it feels good to hear Uematsu's music.  I don't understand those with controller issues, my xbox 360 controller is working fine after swapping the A and B buttons around, functions exactly as it used to."
"This game is amazing!   I'm 25 and i don't have much time to spend playing RPG's unless they REALLY grab my attention but i've heard nothing but good things about this FF9, I heard it was even better than the overly rated (depending on who you ask) Final Fantasy 7, the characters are really likeable, the main characters are actually really likeable, like how Zidane isn't just some moody whiny protagonist with amnesia or something.  And even the combat system has a nice spin to it, like how each major battle kinda introduces a scenerio on how to beat it or something like that.  I haven't finished the game, i'm only about 4 hours in, I probably got a good ways to go, but at the moment i'm really enjoying it!  The only issues I have is the controller support and sometimes the background textures look REALLY dated compared to the updated character models...but overall it's still great."
Auto battle is the best thing that ever happened to this game.
It is.
Best frog catching simulator. 10/10 would catch frogs again.
10/10 willback to childhood again
"I've lost myself to chocobo digging, KHEW!"
"Just got it this morning, but have spent countless hours playing on my Playstation One, Two, and my PsP. A glorious game, truly worth the money! Best game in the series, in my opinion, and probably one of the most underrated games of all time."
HD sprites HQ cinematics  A very underrated game in the FF franchise but with updated ports for PC and Android the game has a wider audience with new players to play the game for the first time and to see first hand the storytelling of Hironobu Sakaguchi.  I'm currently about two hours in of writing this and the game runs smoothly on my year old laptop that is not mean't for gaming so I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys jrpgs and the FF franchise.
"Every person that plays RPG's should have this game in their collection as it is one of the best RPG's ever created. If you never played RPG's before, then Final Fantasy IX would be a perfect place to start.  I'm glad this got a re-release on the PC, it's been 5 or 6 years since I've last played this.  Nostalgia here I come."
"More first impressions than a full review.  Pros: The new UI actually looks pretty decent. Keeps the 4:3 aspect ratio, thus not stretching the picture. You need to remember that the game has pre-rendered backgrounds with entrances and exits, it wouldn't translate to 16:9 resolution. New character models look crisp, but more or less what you'd expect from a PS1 game in terms of graphics.  Cons: 30fps lock will put some people off. Personally it doesn't bother me in a turn based RPG, but ya know, PC Master Race and all that. ;) Exiting the game properly is a chore. You have to go into the config menu, scroll all the way down just to exit the game via the game menu. A simple quit button added to the first Y button menu's interface would be much easier.  An hour in, seems like a good port so far."
"Great game, no issues."
"If you like epic theatrical storys that you will never forget, along with some simple fun gameplay and unique mini-games to complete the game. FFIX is what you are looking for, recommended.  #2k16"
An absolutely amazing game and a must play for any fan of final fantasy.
"How long have we all been waiting for this to come to PC? Most of us believed a mistranslation in an interveiw and believed it never would, FF9 comes to PC!  First off the UI is good, this is not a repeat of the horrid UI in 6, which is what I was most worried about.  Second the game plays exactly as I remember it, from the start it takes you back into a world you will love and enjoy.  Third the upgraded graphics are very nice, you can tell work went into this unlike 7 and 8 which were ported years ago and simply made to run on current gen computers.  All in all this is a fantastic buy for the money."
"Been waiting for this for years. Can't even count how many people on the internet said this would never happen. When are people going to realize that they DON'T KNOW ♥♥♥♥.   anyway, it runs great, looks great, original game is a masterpiece. Only wierd thing is that the updated character graphics look a bit strange on a non-updated background, but who cares. the updated character graphics look amazing, and it's better than no updated graphics at all."
"Pros: Final Fantasy IX (best story and characters)  Updated Graphics A good remake!!!!!!!!! (Sorry, FFVI) Flying Chocobos  Card games to make you tear your hair out Inappropriatly dressed villans Beatrix, after all these years   Cons: ??????????????"
Nostalgic. The high res sprites look nice. The old backdrops don't look that bad either. It's an older game so some of the textures are expected to not be HD quality.   One of my favorites in the series. After IX the whole series started to go downhill..  They really need to go back to their roots with this series..
I've been a Final Fantasy fan for as long as I can remember and playing this game again brings back so much memories. Can't wait to spend countless hours to playing this while looking back when it felt like to be a kid again!!!!
Great game so far
Good port. Speed booster helped a lot. Story rich with a lot of character development and interaction.
"Great port of Final Fantasy IX. One of the best Final Fantasy games. Square improved loading times, graphics, can now skip FMV scenes and there's a auto battle feature for easy fights."
"My favorite game of the entire franchise. The HD re-release models clash slightly against the lower res backgounds, but the visuals are still great. The only real downside is the UI that's fit more to be used on mobile devices.   All in all buy this damn game, it's a classic! And if you don't like RPG's, you can always be a baby and activate cheats to negate any and all actual gameplay!"
"Square Enix did a great job porting this game. The detail of the game looks much cleaner from the PSone, this game is a must own if you are into jrpgs! I played this before on the PSone and this will be my second time playing through. I definitely recommend this game! Peace"
"Final Fantasy IX is easily one of the best Final Fantasies out there. Zidane was a breath of fresh air after Cloud and Squall depressed us with their emo mannerisms. All of the characters were fun and exciting. The story itself seems to transcend its own seriousness in lieu of light-hearted silliness and many many opportunities to get sidetracked with other activities, like Chocobo Digging and Tetra Master.   The PC release offers us help in the form of fast forwarding, easy skills, and max gil. I will admit to being tempted to use them, and I would recommend it for any buyers who lack the patience for an old grindy game, but there has been and always will be a feeling of satisfaction that comes with seeing your efforts pay off when you finally learn a new skill or level up after a lengthy grinding session.  I have heard a couple of reports of controllers not working, though my lame Steelseries 3GC works just fine, and I have seen people using the 360 controller reporting no issues as well.   The polished character models are fantastic! I can, for the first time, appreciate the detail that went into these characters. Faces that simply looks like colored blobs of pixels, now actually look like faces and their bodies have details I had only noticed in cutscenes and closeups. Unfortunately, the backgrounds were not upgraded. I have read that this is due to much of the original material being lost over the years.  All-in-all, I'll say that this game is worth the price, especially since it is discounted off the bat. I would have gladly paid $25 just due to the sheer amount of content in this game. You will get your moneys worth in this. Don't fret over how old the game is until you've seen how much is in it."
"Even if this game turned out to be a terrible port, it's likely I would still recommend it. Final Fantasy IX is my favorite game of all time and I could wax poetically about it for hours. I won't though. The port is well done, the new models look great, the HD cut scenes were beyond what I expected, and the slight changes to the interface are welcome. What can I say? If you've never played this game, buy it! If you've already played it, buy it!"
"Never got the chance to play FFIX on ps1 when I was a kid because I was never into these types of games. FFXIII was the game that actually brought me into this series.   But I really enjoyed this one.   Pros:  The characters are awesome, especially Zidane, Dagger, Vivi and Cid.  Good story Port is decent (it did lag a bit for me and crashed once, but didn't have any other problems with it) The villain is great  The graphics are good, especially the cutscenes.   Cons:  I can't think of any negatives.  If you haven't played it before on the ps1, its worth picking up. If you played it before, well you probably know if you want to pick it up or not.   "
Game is running smoothly and no issues. Unfortunatly fullscreen = boarders around the outside.  SPOILER WARNING  Doing the mini jump rope game gives you items and IF by some miracle of a chance that the gods of skipping look at you and show pitty and allow you to even see the 1000 jumps completed in a row you will be rewarded. I have just found a new hatred for skipping rope.
An excellent port!!! Its better than playing on an emulator in terms of visual quality and sound. Not to mention they added m/kb support as well!! BUY IT!!!
Such a good port! I used be trash or something cause I was never able to get 100 nobles impressed before..until now. They made it rain 10k gil on me which I spent on multiples of the same items for synthesis and what not.
"Can finally relive my childhood. No problems with the port, just get it!"
"A very good port, some hiccups in the loading but otherwise a great game and should be played by all."
The best Final Fantasy game to date.
"done ok. there will be mods that will fix the other stuff.  this is basically the same as the iphone version that was release much earlier.  i bought this only to support FF9 and what it is to me, ill probably keep playing it on my phone instead though."
This game has always been on par with Final Fantasy 7 in regards to story. I am so pleased that they finally brought this to PC and didn't change a thing other than adding cloud save support and buffing the character models. The soundtrack is the same as it was back on PlayStation. If you have never played this game before I urge you to buy it and playthrough this fantastic storyline. This so far has been a wonderful nostalgia trip for me. I bought this as midnight and played a couple hours and I actually am annoyed I have to put it down to get a couple hours of sleep. BUY THIS BUY THIS NOW!
"Add this to the slew of praise that this port is about to receive, but to be frank, it's well deserved.  This isn't going to be a review of the actual game, as I'm going to assume you already know it. But I just wanted to say that they did it! They actually went and bloody did it! They ported/ adapted/ remixed (whatever you want to call it) a game that was in sore need of love and recognition, and they didn't screw it up!   If, like me, you were worried that there would be some issues that would need to be modded/ fixed by other users to deal with the lazy ports of VII and VIII, then fear not! They got it right! It looks gorgeous, it sounds beautiful and you don't have to painstakingly set up any controls in the menu (I'm using a 360 controller, and it works like a dream).   I don't think they did much work on the maps as some of the backgrounds and their respective animations... they look a bit... choppy (e.g. the audience in the fight between Blank and Zidane), however that's not a problem, it was like that in the PS1 version, so it's no big deal. The character models look stunning too! Christ! They're incredibly sharp! The FMVs are wonderful too!  I cannot reccommend this version enough! If you loved the PS1 version, then you'll be blown away by this!   Also I kinda like oglops."
"tl;dr: Overall it's a good port. There are changes to the UI, sound effects have been updated, videos have better resolution, characters are great, controls are ok.  - If you're a fan of Final Fantasy games, don't miss this release.  - If you have neve played this game on PSX, here's your chance, do it.  - If you played it on a emulator, It feels like playing it on a decent emulator, with the best possible quality, and also some dark magic improving models and textures (things a emulator can't do properly). Plus, it has all the charm of various language options, Achievements, Cloud Save and Trading Cards.  -- Comparisons to PSX version  UI: The UI was basically remade. It has touch support, which translates to mouse clicks on the PC side, and navigation using a controller feels mostly the same as it was in the console version. Player portraits inparticular look great. The downside is that it runs at a faster framerate than the gameplay itself, making some UI graphics shutter when it tries to follow a model character, such as damage text when a creature dies.   Music: It features the same music used in the original game, with a small difference. The PSX game had its music done using a sequenced with specific samples. The game can be speed up using the F1 key, which makes the whole game faster, except the music, making the battle encounters and battle spoils moments completely gone, and would make Mr. Uematsu quite unhappy. This version uses a compressed recorded version of the original PSX music, which leads to the best fidelity, but with a small impact on quality. If have a good ear for subtle things like this, it'll bother you a little; most people won't even notice.   Controls: Using a gamepad, it feels like a PSX, except for some parts of the UI, where it behaves slightly different from the original counterpart, such as the battle scene, where selecting the target of a skill is easier to select using up and down in the enemy list instead of selecting the enemy looking at him, using left or right. Inputting the character name is also different and quite counter-intuitive: I had to grab the mouse and click on the text box, and then click Confirm.  Models: The character models are great, and their textures also look great. The battle scene models remain the same as the original PSX game, which makes it look a bit outdated, which is fine, since we're playing a port, not a remake. Also about the battle scene, the level textures uses some filtering. It doesn't help, but doesn't hurt to have it. The prerendered backgrounds are fine just the way they were, also featuring the same texture filtering, also not helping nor damaging.   -- Veredict  Overall it's a good port. Being someone who played throughfully the PSX version, It feels like the psx version, with slightly better graphics. Being able to keep your save in the cloud and basically never lose it? Big plus. The things I miss in ths game: New Game+ and better storage of Tetra cards.   Score: 9/10   P.S.: Overall, It's a good thing they didn't redo the textures, the music or the levels. It would look like a whole new game, and at the same time, and perheaps not being par to current quality of games. In fact, if they were to rework the game, they should literally rework the whole game, not just the textures, and would end up like FF7, taking a lot of time and a lot of resources to rework the whole thing."
"Slightly torn because it doesn't look great on my wide screen set up and, while the models look wonderful, there is a huge contrast between the environment and the characters. It almost ruins the experience because the environment is so blurry and then you have these crisp clean characters. With this said, this is my favorite game ever. If blurry backgrounds don't bother you then you are good to go."
My favorite final fantasy title!  Challenging/ Awesome Story+Characters 
"Hands down the best FF PC Port that Square has done in recent years, and the best Final Fantasy game to boot. Yes, yes, yes, absolutely buy this!"
"A very good port!  - no dumb keymapping, no NumPad etc. You mostly need X, C, V, and B with either arrow keys or WASD for movement, turn on 'Always Run' in the menu and you won't need the mouse. You can also navigate with the mouse like in a point-and-click adventure.  - graphical update is mostly good. In a few cases the low-res backgrounds are jarring, the originals have been lost apparently. Runs well on my 5 years old laptop, but no widescreen, there are constant gray bars on both sides.  - F1 ALL THE THINGS - 2,3x speedup via F1 makes long fights with summons bearable, also great when you're stuck in a location and missed a door somewhere, it's easy to visit all screens in a few seconds. It's a godsend when the game makes you watch something boring like that dance in Cleyra. F1 can also be used as a cheat: when you're in one of the missions with a time-limit the clock isn't affected by the speed-up. I've encountered a minor bug: A few times I've managed to F1 the animated cutscenes with no way to turn it off, you have to hit F1 at exactly the right time for the bug to trigger.  - The other F-keys are cheats, the only useful one is F4 which turns off random encounters (that includes the 'good' ones!), good for exploring or when you're running low on supplies.  - Autosave! You still have the old-school save locations, but you also get a autosave every time you change the location, good for when you lost a valuable Tetra playing card, or when a boss is far away from the last savepoint. Apparently this save is only accessible over the 'Continue' button in the main menu.  It's one of the best JRPGs!"
"Great game  Hasn't just been ported, its been properly transferred over &amp; tweaked Plays very well"
WELL THIS GAME IS STILL ONE OF MY ALTIME FAVS AND THAT WILL NPT CHANGE ONLY THING I CANT GET TO WORK ARE THE NO ENCOUNTERS OPTIONS
It's a pleasure to be able to experience FF9 once again and it is every bit as charming as i remembered.
"Play this game many years ago and already forgot the story.. Replay now, it's good."
This game is probably the best final fantasy that no one gave much respect to. To start this port is insanely awesome when you think about how much work had to go into it with the loss of certain assets of the original game. The music nobuo uematsu was always an incredible composer but this was definitely one of his finer works. Each and every ounce of this game was set to fit a setting and it succeeded. This game is a fantastic experience and i would suggest any jrpg fan revisit it!
"I was sceptical at first,given that FF9 never originally appeared on the PC,that and the game is 16 years old and was originally made for the PS1,which would make any kind of port tricky.I recall when I brought FF7 from steam that it lacked mouse control,which made navigating the menus tricky.Thankfully,it seems they have seen sense to add moue support.  This is a really good port for a game that's 16 year old and already a port of the mobile version.There have been raised eyebrows at user interface being a little big,but it's no big deal to me.  Although you can play the game at full screen,I advise against doing so the pre rendered (is that the right word?) backgrounds will look hideous  "
"Absolutely love this game. Defenitely brings back childhood memories. This has to be the ultimate FF9 in terms of graphics. The characters absolutely look stunning, the music has to be one of the finest ever composed for a videogame. It also works perfectly fine with a controller. I'm using the Xbox one-wired to play this gem and it works like a dream. Buy this game allready!"
"Great game. By far the best Final Fantasy game in the series. I highly recommend to anyone looking to try an FF game for the first time, or relive one of the best in the series.   For the port, it has some good and bad.  Good: - F-Keys add a bunch of functionality like multiplying speed, adding levels, no encounters, etc. - Graphical updates. It looks much prettier now, especially combat, characters, and tetramaster. - Smooth. The game wasn't very choppy back on the PS, but even less so now. Even with multiplied speed it works great. - Great port to Unity that functions similarly on a lot of computers. Easily modable and decompilable, at the time of this writing.  Cons: - Resolution is weird. You have to play with it quite a bit to get rid of the bars - Oddly slow at several points. There is literally more lag at times than on the PS (to be fair, its much faster most times) - Controls. The mouse tends to get stuck at the center of the screen, xb1 controller has problems being registered. This might be due to not playing well with multimonitor. To fix I often win-key out and click on the titlebar of the non-windowed app or alt-tab out and in to fix it. - The backgrounds are not HD. Since theyre pre-rendered, they look about the same as they did before.  All of the cons could easily be fixed, with the exception of the backgrounds. I don't expect many of these to last more than an update or two."
beautiful old shcool game come to pc realy love it...
This is a good port compared to other FF titles.
Ok so this is basically the same product you get when u run ff9 on a ps1 emulator and crank up the resolution to hd. And that......is exactly what i wanted!! Thanks square for finally listening to the fans on this one. I didn't want a new ff9 i just wanted the same one with updated graphics. Bonus is all the bonus little features they added. Very well done! For $16 I'm so happy to relive my favorite ff game of all time!
"The highly anticipated FF9 is the one of the series that i was waiting for a long time. I remember playing it in PS1, when it came in a 4 disks pack. I played the game for more than 140 hours. So if you are one of those who buys the game taking into consideration how much time of fun will the game provide. This one is for you. Even more if you like rpg games, with lots of powers, and mini games (like the card game and chokobo's) you´ll find hours and hours of entertainment submerging into this world!"
"This port of an old PSX game makes a classic better than ever! All of the upgrades, including a way to make the battle transitions shorter, auto saving (which is hard to understand at first), higher res models/textures, beautiful menus, etc., are welcome. Here's hoping they give 7 and 8 this kind of treatment (unity ports for mobile, back ported to Windows - very nice!).  The game is just as fantastic as I remember, and even my kids are interested in it due to it's quirky story line and characters, and fantastic (largely upgraded) graphics. Certainly the best FF for PSX, and maybe the best ever.  There are a couple of nits (one of them a bug that should be fixed) to be aware of:  1. You can remap the flawed XBox controller defaults (actually, I switched it back to default so my buttons match the prompts and that feels fine - still, this is a bug), but if you do use custom mappings, the onscreen prompts will all be incorrect! A frustrating bug that should be fixed!  2. There is some stuttering in various places with my older hardware (Core 2 Duo 2.6GHz, 4GB RAM, GeForce 650 GTX). I'm not sure if it's my older bus speed, or my slow hard drive (using my SSD didn't seem to help), but scrolling and screen transitions on the tiled screens is stuttery, until the textures are loaded - then it's smooth (hopefully they add a way to preload all the textures per screen at once - slightly longer load between screens would be better than stuttering).  Finally, where's the Mac and Linux ports (my newer hardware doesn't run Windows)? This thing is built on Unity, it should be easy. ;-)"
"If you are not familiar with this game, perhaps you should read another review, but...  If you loved the original game on PS1, you'll love this one too.  If you loved the original game on PS1, but you DON'T like this one... Wow... Look at yourself. What sort of person have you become?   Sure, some of the backgrounds and secondary assets at times seem a bit... 'fuzzy' and not quite on par with the new character models that they are so often awkwardly juxtaposed with, but the overall visual presentation exceeds that of the original game while still maintaining the same spirit and feel. And yes, the battle UI is a bit too big. And yes, the 'Boosters' feel somewhat out of line with the spirit of the original game, seeming to cater to the now much-maligned 'casual' gamer. And OH NO, it's a mobile port, and OH NOOO it's 2016 and the game is still in 4:3! How terrible!  If the original game enchanted you, but you are now put off by these superficial flaws... are you happy with the person you've become?   As for price, well, I look at it like this: In my adolescent carelessness, the 4th disc to my original copy was scratched and unplayable by around 2003, I never got in more than 2-3 playthroughs, never got to sink in the countless hours with IX in the same way I did with VII, VIII, and X. Making up lost time is more than worth this price.  You really can't ask for greater depth or charm out of a Final Fantasy game than this. Final Fantasy IX is a shining example of the greatness of this franchise in the days of old. Few (if any) subsequent FF titles have surpassed it.   Turning it on, and hearing the music of the intro cutscene: instant, warm, gooey nostalgia.  10/10 Would write lengthy review again    "
"Framerate and loading can be a bit annoying, but past that it's pretty fun to play. The first part of the game is pretty linear, but past that there's a whole bunch of exploration and fun stuff to do instead of playing through the story.  And of course, it has the Final Fantasy combat system and overworld, so easy positives there."
"The video game that got me into RPGs. It's fantastic. Both the story and the characters are absolutely compelling and to see it as such a great port just warms my little tender nerd heart. I'd recommend this to anyone.   Also, Vivi is the best."
"This game is awesome let me explain  -HD backgrounds and characters  -Untouched Original sound track -Game boosters for people who don't know how to play a FF game -Save anywhere which also helps you when you die at bosses(accidently) -A legal option to play on PC -controls are a little problem starting off, but not game breaking -one of the best if not the best story on Par with FFVI   However I stubbed my toe.. Not recommended "
Amazing game! An incredible experience throughout.
Awsome..
"Finally able to try out this one now on PC. The game still holds up well after all these years, and everything about it is quite unique compared to today's games out there."
Nostalgia is the only word you can use really.
"Probably my favorite Final Fantasy, if you haven't played it I would highly recommend it!"
Having never played this game I think it really is one of the best of the series. I highly recommend playing through this game if you never have. Works great with 360 controller on Steam link also. That's how I played it from start to finish.
"The reboot is fantastic! The updated character models are wonderful and the soundtrack is just as delightful as I remember! The sounds are crisp and clear. The menus look so polished, and they even added boosters for people who don't have the time to grind away characters. Its not entirely revamped on backgrounds though, but it doesn't take away from the game. In my opinion, if you loved ff9, you will LOVE this."
"First FF I ever played, it was a transcendant experience. I went on to 7,8, 12 and now recently 13. I've stopped 13 to go back to this, and 9 makes 13 feel like a childs attempt at a story.   Nine has some of the best elements in FF history despite it having an art style that may not register so well with some adults. Its funny as heck, sincere and unassuming. The battle system is simple, but who cares when the story, places, people, cultures and world is so rich. A text based delivery system for the characters allows for a lot more information to be relayed and for a lot more character development to take place.  The old style open world system has a romance about it that is lost in the other systems that came about with later installments in the series.   This game is phenomenal.   Unique and beautiful game that came from the golden age of FF games from FF5-FF10."
"I'll start by saying that this Final Fantasy isn't like the others. It's probably what people imagined the next Final Fantasy to be like after they played Final Fantasy III on Super Nintendo and were waiting for the first 3D game consoles to hit shelves. Instead, what they got was Final Fantasy VII. FFVII is a great game and deserves the accolades it gets, but to me, Final Fantasy IX hits a home run. This is the game I wanted. I loved it on Playstation and I love it now. It's my favorite Final Fantasy.  If you enjoy JRPGs and have not played this, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot. The music is Nobuo Uematsu at his best and of the three Playstation era Final Fantasy games it has the best graphics. Square really knew the ins and the outs of the Playstation by this point. The characters are likable(make sure you get those Active Time Events so you see what they're up to!) and the gameplay(while slow, can be sped up in the menu, with a booster using the F1 key, and with an Auto-Haste ability!) is what you'd expect from a classic Final Fantasy game.   This version regrettably does not have hi-res backgrounds allegedly because Square lost the master assets to the game. This is incredibly saddening as this game deserves to look its absolute best. Even so, the new models look great and I did not run into the problems other people are talking(controller issues, mine works fine) about other than a sound glitch when you use an Elixer and that is hardly a deal breaker. This is easily the best PC port that Square has done, and though I wish they had kept the master assets I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fan of the series that has not tried it yet.  10/10 would cry at the ending again"
"Final Fantasy IX remains as my favorite FF for it's storyline, world and characters. The theme of life permeates every aspect of the game, be it the genuinely humane characters (even the antagonists) who cling to life, whatever their challenge may be, the world that heavily features the process of life, death and rebirth or the story that ultimately becomes a love letter to life itself. I strongly suggest giving this game a chance solely because it's by itself a big life lesson if you play it with the correct mindset.  Also, for those who don't understand the final boss's motives or appearance: Every final boss in the series is the origination point of all the conflict in every entry. With FFIX there's no difference. Read below for spoilers.    Necron is THE entity of chaos/death/destruction that was the driving force behind the Lifa Tree, a force not understood by Garland, but used nonetheless when he created Soulcage, the mist originator. When Kuja used Ultima at the Crystal, creation itself was about to be undone since the Crystal is the binding force of all that exists, so the sheer force of that brought them to encounter Necron, the counterside of creation who set out to carry out Ultima's effect on creation. Then the battle background in the final battle strongly suggests that it's the Lifa tree's trunk, or a symbol of it. There they were figthing against the very essence of destruction and the cycle of death that was brought in by Garland when he created the Lifa tree to replace Gaia's souls with those of Terra in a process of endless war instigated by the effects of the mist.

"In general this is the best version of this game around especially if you were like me and still played it on an emulator. Pros:  - Models (character, NPC, monsters) look fantastic and have great detail  - Graphics in general much improved  - Good controller support (xbox 360 controller in my case, have not given the kb and mouse a shot)  - Original audio and it sounds fantastic  - Still one of the best FF titles IMO  - The text looks great and is really readable  - Skipable cutscenes  - When you select continue on the title menu the game picks up right where you left off, nice feature  Cons:  - It's a port of the mobile release so it's graphical options are limited to resolution. Wish we had some basic AA or something. - While the models and cutscenes in the game look awesome the pre-rendered backgrounds were not given verry much love they could really use some additional touch ups - The battle UI is god awful for a PC game. It's friggen gigantic and spread out all over the screen. I wish we had the original PS1 UI at this point. - The cheats are OK but I was really hoping we could get two things: and increase in difficulty (tougher battles) and a sensible increase in battle speed. I know you can speed the whole game up like crazy but that's not really what I was hoping for. Was hoping for 1.5x the speed of the max battle speed setting in game options. - No in game controlls to set the sound level, have to do it with the Volume Mixer in Windows. - Minor gripe but I hate how getting close to any NPC causes '!' to pop up.  In short, I love this game and this port is pretty decent. It could have been better for PC players but whatever, still beats playing on an emulator. I hope that it gets some slick mods like FF7 and FF8 got but I am slightly doubtful because of it's mobile origins. 99/100 Nobels were impressed."
"Very good adapation of the game, the upgraded models look a little odd and stand out a bit but all and all a 8 hours in a very faithfull."
This game was good back then and is good now even with the bad graphics
One of the best Final Fantasies out there and you should play it if you haven't played it already.
Still the same amazing game. Controller support for this game is great with Xbox 360/One controller If you havent played it I recommend it.
My life is compete.   10/10
"I'm probably in the minority of people who played this on day one when it came out on PS1, but think this is a great port overall- just use a lower resolution and windowed mode and it will look a lot better, even if it's smaller. Of course we would all love to see hi-res backgrounds, and higher fps in battles, but those don't seem like they will ever happen unfortuantely, so let's move on.  I am using a wirelss Xbox One controller with official dongle, and just have to make sure the controller is off when I start the game, then I turn it on and no problems (although this needs to be patched). The game itself is one of the best FFs, and even better with the boosts for modern gaming's tastes. Highly recommended."
"i love this game so much and i have played equaly so much back on my ps1 with the 4 cd's (copy wich i still own and it was my very first game) .  To this day my mom still knows whats a chocobo because i kept playing the hide and seek minigame in this game quite alot, and she still asks if they are always yellow now or if they have diferent colours, since your chocobo keeps being upgraded with diferent abilities and new colours as you progress in the minigame.  nostalgia might make me biased, but to this day i still have lots of fun with this game and i'm very glad i dont need to use other means to play this game on my pc, and the graphics are even improved, so with that i HAVE to recomend this game.  also first game i buy day one available on steam.  ps. cant believe vivi still can steal grandmas savings right at the begining.... he is OP though so it's ok."
"fyi this is a pretty decent port which is really surprising for a back catalog FF game on steam!!  Runs well, interface is mobile-y but not too bad (it actually tries to keep the style of the original UI unlike a lot of other FF mobile-&gt;PC ports). Mouse controls are a lil unresponsive but otherwise they did a surprisingly good job of creating a PC-centric control scheme. Controllers work fine, the one sticking point being that there's no analog movement so it's a little awkward moving around with an analog stick.  Graphically it looks about as good as you'd expect from a $20 Unity port of FF9; character models and UI are high res, backgrounds are blurry messes because they're the original PSX assets stretched out. Kinda sucks but it's completely understandable given the limited scope of the project.  Also the game itself is really cute and fun if a bit shallow!! Maybe I'll do a real review later but just wanted to tell people that this port is Safe to Buy"
"Final Fantasy IX is one of my favorite games of all time. So this review may be biased.  First of all, should a person who likes Final Fantasy or Role Playing Games in general buy this game? The answer is yes! As other reviews have stated this game has charm oozing from it.  The story, in my opinion is wonderful and heartfelt. The setting is a living fairy tale world with just enough steampunk to keep it entertaining. The characters are wonderful.  Enough about the old stuff. What about the new? The new character models are excellent. The ability to speed up battles is also great. Turning off random encounters, while not something I would usually do, is becoming tempting because of the encounter rate in certain areas. There is a lot of good. I have especially enjoyed the sharper graphics and enhanced cutscenes. I am seeing details that I didn't know were in them, and I have played this game countless times through. This is the best version of Final Fantasy IX.  So...what do I wish was better? The backgrounds and some of the NPCs could have been touched up a little. I know that replacing backgrounds would have required phenomenal effort, but I know there are some high quality backgrounds floating around the internet. Perhaps a future update could gradually improve the visuals that way. Honestly, it's not a deal breaker. This is the best version of the game. In closing, if you are at all a fan of the JRPG genre, this game is for you. A great story, great side quests, and a lot of depth. Enjoy!"
always loved this classic game
cool
"By far the best Final Fantasy Port to date, If you enjoyed the original Playstation game, you can't go far wrong picking this up. Such a shame the other Ports to date have not been up to the same standard."
Even after 15 years the game is an absolute piece of art. The rework is also really good.  Right into the nostalgia.
Died after 1 hour without manual saving.  10/10 would autosave again.
"Don't listen to the haters. This is a fantastic way to play FFIX. The new HD models look good and are a breath of fresh air for a game thats 16 years old. Controller support works great, im using a Logitech F310 gamepad and have had no issues. Also the auto save feature is really cool, found out about that when I died to an unexpected crit on the Sealion. No more going back to the last moogle. If you liked FFIX and want to play it again ditch the emulators and get this version."
"HOLY COW! I don't think I've ever been this excited for a rerelease of a game before!  This game runs really smoothly on my current PC. The audio seems to be in perfect sync, which some of the other ports (VII and VIII mostly) have had some trouble with. I love the updated models, and while they're not Dissida level, they look 100% better than they did in the old game, and still are able to capture the original image of it.  I really love all of the improvements, plus the booster system made a 'for fun run' much easier, especially if you want that rare and elusive 'Excalibur II' for Steiner.   All in all, this game is ported well, the thing just makes me happy.  Note: For controller usage, I ended up switching the Confirm and Cancel buttons (From B being Confirm and A being Cancel) to make it a bit more like the original on the Playstation. But that's just me."
"man it's been years since I've played this classic. Loved it then and love it now as well.  Pros:  - the graphic updates to the characters makes it where I can actually see their faces, as well as see what the monster cards actually look like.  - the 'cheats' they have in the form of boosters was a nice touch, since I can turn some of them on and off like I could when I had a gameshark (although back then I had to restart the game by shutting it off to turn off the cheats).  - having no encounter will be good if I ever decide to do a speed run, as I never did it before (back with the original I used a cheat that would reset the game timer back to 0:00:00 so that I could enjoy the game and explore everything without having to sacrifice anything and so I could get that excal 2).  Cons:  - Sometimes using those cheats makes me feel dirty lol, even though I've played it many many times and used more cheats than that with the psx before.  - Steiner with his face looking like it has makeup on (looks like he has eyeliner on to me)  - This version doesn't have the cheat to reset the timer, only one I would use very often, but in a way that makes since as all the people who do legitimate speed runs would be upset with it.  Overall was impressed with this rerelease of the game, definately makes the nostalgia part of my brain happy."
"Welcome to Final Fantasy 9 (steam). After 90+ days since announcement, hopefully it was worth the wait. To play this amazing game, buy it from the steam store and install it. If you have any questions, you can reach me at FinalF/steam and my favorite class is the thief. Thanks and have fun."
"'Final Fantasy IX' is definitely my favorite in the series, and one of my favorite games of all-time for that matter. So upon hearing that this game would ported to PC, I got super excited. This is a game that I feel (or rather now felt) didn't get the recognition it deserved. Admittedly, I did get a little worried, considering that the ports of FFV,FFVI, and even FFVIII weren't well-received by fans (not including the graphic and music mods inputted in those games).  So after playing at least 7 hours of this port, I would have to say, YES!! THEY DIDN'T SCREW IT UP!! NO CRAPPY RESOLUTIONS, NO MIDI MUSIC, NO LAGGING!!  *ahem* Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised that this port was not only great, but also a decent contender of the most definitive version of the game, giving the original PS1 version a run for its money. The graphics are updated and more crisped, the FMVs (cinematic cutscenes) have gotten an extremely HD boost and looks absolutely spectacular, the music is the same as it should be, the mouse support really helps in some parts, and the battle system is more helpful,giving you the option to change and defend in on menu (though that's kind of a small thing).  The only nitpicks I have with this version is that one: the battle swirl is a little less fluent than in the PS1 version, two: it's kind of a hassle to exit to game, having to go to the menu to exit it instead of doing so pressing ESC, and three: I kinda don't like that this game is not fully controller compatible. When I use my PS4 controller to play the game, Zidane walks either to the left or right. But again, like I said, they're nitpicks. A keyboard works fine as well.   Overall, SE managed to not screw up this port of the game. I say if you want to go on an nostalgic trip, or if you want to play this game for the first time, buy this port! :)"
"Finally, a Final Fantasy game that has proper ports - not to forget the HD additions look spectacular! Super thrilled to be adding this childhood classic to my library."
"Great game, great port!  The boosters are a nice addition for those who want to use them."
"Probably my favorite Final Fantasy, if you haven't played it I would highly recommend it!"
"A classic JRPG. It's got a great story, catchy music that you'll start humming it and plenty of minigames!"
After all these years Final Fantasy IX is still my go to game! 
"It's Final Fantasy IX. The Music, The Characters. 10/10 It bring's back Nostalgia of when i was young.. I cri evry tim..."
Thank you Square Enix and those who made it possible.  Thank you.   A good game is able to withstand the trial of time and continue to shine. FFIX is the gem which have not dull at all. Hope the younger generation can appreciate the games from the past.
"One of the best Final Fantasy games in the series if not the best in my opinion.  Story rich, unforgettable characters, an epic journey and one hell of a time. This game is wonderful, beautiful, and eternally beloved by fans of the series."
"Final Fantasy IX remains as my favorite FF for it's storyline, world and characters.

"FF9 is without doubt the best game in final fantasy series. Story is intresting and music is not from this world. Battlesystem is little slow for my taste but that's only a minor annoyance.  Well that was obivious but what about the quality of pc-port?  I think this is the definite version of ff9, models especially are much nicer looking then ps1. It's shame that the game prerendered backscreens are blurry. New additions from the pc ports are boosters that boost gamespeed (too much imo) and max stats etc. These are fine additions but the game is really not that hard without few expections. (Im looking at you Ball of Swirling death).  It's not perfect port but if you haven't experienced Final Fantasy 9 I highly recommend you to pick it up even with full price. It's just that good."
"Never got the chance to play FFIX on ps1 when I was a kid because I was never into these types of games. FFXIII was the game that actually brought me into this series.   But I really enjoyed this one.   Pros:  The characters are awesome, especially Zidane, Dagger, Vivi and Cid.  Good story Port is decent (it did lag a bit for me and crashed once, but didn't have any other problems with it) The villain is great  The graphics are good, especially the cutscenes.   Cons:  I can't think of any negatives.  If you haven't played it before on the ps1, its worth picking up. If you played it before, well you probably know if you want to pick it up or not.   "
"I've only played the first couple of hours but like many others on here i've eagerly anticipated the release of this game. One of the best in the series IMO and there hasn't been a better one since.   Don't listen to the trolls/idiots on here who complain about pretty much anything regardless of the fact we've waited for a port of FFIX for years!  If,like me, you appreciate the fact you can finally play FFIX with Steam achievements, controller support, graphical improvements and a few other neat upgrades then i suggest you buy this right now!  To those who are complaining, do you really think SE would put lots of money into a 'proper' HD remaster of this game when it's probably only got a small following and wouldn't make sense to invest a lot of money into.  No - stop whining and either play the game and enjoy it or don't! Simple!"

One of the best RPGs of all time just got better. There is literally nothing about this that is bad. Good price for a fantastic amount of wonderful gameplay. 10/10 would buy again
Really good port of a really good classic game. GOTY all over again.
"Best version what we have got. 5/5 would play again, and I will."
Fast Forwarding makes life so much easier :D
Thank you Square Enix and those who made it possible.  Thank you.   A good game is able to withstand the trial of time and continue to shine. FFIX is the gem which have not dull at all. Hope the younger generation can appreciate the games from the past.
"The reboot is fantastic! The updated character models are wonderful and the soundtrack is just as delightful as I remember! The sounds are crisp and clear. The menus look so polished, and they even added boosters for people who don't have the time to grind away characters. Its not entirely revamped on backgrounds though, but it doesn't take away from the game. In my opinion, if you loved ff9, you will LOVE this."
"Lets start with the common fears I noticed around the forums here. No, this isn't a port of the mobile version, yes it is a port of the original games, but an incredible one.   The Pros: -This is arguably one of the top 3 best of the series, and its finally on steam! -The boosters take the fun away, but its an option for speedrunners and tricky areas. With that said for legit players, the super speed option is great for level grinding! -Nobou Uematsu soundtrack -A fun, and touching story.  The Cons:  -There really aren't any significant ones.. -Like I said its a port of the PS1 original, so while the game is now running at 60fps, the animations aren't silky smooth because they weren't made that way in the original. Not an issue to me, but may be for some. -Some of the prerendered backgrounds definitely haven't aged well.  -Some minor cosmetic changes that you'll notice if you played a ton of the originals. Example being, Vivi doesn't close his eyes anymore when he casts spells, or that sometimes when something gets close to the screen, it'll clip a bit and piece of the object disappears (see Steiners victory animation with his sword).  -As this game had disc specific things that you needed to do or they'd be gone, it'd be nice to have a cut where a disc would have ended, like an 'End of part 1' or something when you finished disc 1.  So all in all, the cons don't really mean much in terms of the overall experience. With that said, buy the game, play the game, and enjoy!"
"Played this game since I was a kid. Still have the PS1 copy and I play it occasionally. The graphics have been amazingly remastered (aside from the orginial low res backgrounds). A lot of the sound effects themselves have been updated/changed as well. It feels as if I'm playing a new game again, even though it's the same one I've loved for years."
Fantastic game. Was great 16 years ago and is still great today. No Widescreen support but thats ok. Game looks so much cleaner now than it did on the Playstation 1. I am enjoying the pc version. At the time of this review 4/15/16 I must note there is a slight controller issue. In order for me to play with a xbox one controller I must start the game with the controller unplugged and wait till after I have started the game. Minor complaint but does not ruin the game. I am sure Square will fix this small issue. Controller works fine afterwards. Also the cloud save feature does not work at this time between pc and android/ios
"After the cluster♥♥♥♥ that was Final Fantasy 6, I was leery of anything from Square. I decided to take a leap of faith after reading some early good reviews. Holy ♥♥♥♥, am I glad I did. I lost my ♥♥♥♥ after starting the game for the first time, and was actually given the option of CHANGING THE RESOLUTION. Holy balls, no more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 2004-era resolution, now you are only as limited as your hardware. It's almost as if Square read my negative review of FF6 and agreed with me when I said it was shameful that KOTOR 2 released an update allowing for higher rez, and this brand new game was capped at a lower rez.   Things only improved once I heard the music. They actually ported the PSX music from the original. That's right, no lame MIDI music a la FF7 port here. Cinematics look exactly the same, except somehow even cleaner and crisper than a PC emulator. Now lets get this out of the way straight off the bat, because some ♥♥♥♥tards on Steam have been giving negative reviews based on this next fact. Yes, there ARE bars down the side of the screen, so it doesn't take up the full screen. It is a negative, yes, but unlike those perfectionist ♥♥♥♥tards, I don't believe that is enough to say the entire game is ♥♥♥♥ because of it.  Overall, is this game an HD remake as believed? Yes, a thousand times. In my FF6 review, I argued that they should have just taken the SNES version, ported it over to the PC and not change a single thing, and it would have been perfect. Square did that with this game, and so much more. They took the PSX diamond of a game, and polished it to a mirror sheen. The scenery is gorgeous, the combat feels fluid, hell, even the text of the dialogue looks crisp and more legible than ever. It's not one single detail that elevates it, it's the thousand different details that make it so enjoyable. Unlike FF6, I have no intention of refunding this game within the first 30 minutes of playing; I intend to play this game for a very, very long time.   Bravo, Square. You CAN learn from your mistakes, you CAN be taught. Just give the fans exactly what they want, and they will eat it up in droves. Square did for Final Fantasy IX what Fox did for the recent Deadpool movie. Listen to your fans, and they will buy your game. Simple. Now I'm telling you to buy this game, because this behaviour needs to be rewarded."
Positive review because game is good. Review to come later for the port itself
This game is the best FF out there. Dont think just buy!
must buy!!
"You can always trust a classic final fantasy game. No glitches, perfect, smooth gameplay. Damn awesome therapy for quitting my job."
"Just how I remember it. Back when games were simple, back when DLC wasn't a thing."
So happy I can play this again!!! Thanks for releasing it!!! :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
"This is probably the best of the Final Fantasy games to be introduced to steam, but as a game and also a pretty well made port.  It has some improvements over the playstation original, like sharper character models and higher resolution. Mostly I'm happy that it works really well.  Sure, they could have improved the cutscenes maybe, and maybe the battle-ui could have been slightly smaller. But I wholeheartedly recommend this version of a superb game!"
"Ah thank god they didnt screw this up &lt;3 only one thing came to bother me just now :D I was fighting black waltz 1 and sealion, and when the battle began i had trance and it didnt even after 3 turns wear off :O plus i didnt lose hp from their attacks.. Thats only thing that bothers me atm. But in general i love it!"
"They did some work on the graphics so that it looks better on the PC. If you love the final fantasy series and haven't played it before, try it! It is different from 7 and 8 but are also PS1 classics. :D Welcome to the world of Gaia!"
"Great game, great port!  The boosters are a nice addition for those who want to use them."
"If you enjoyed it on PS, you will enjoy it here"
I have waited for this for so long... And it didn't dissappoint!
Great game AND it's on PC.
Kupo/10 would Kupo Again. All right. I forgive you for holding out on us Square-Enix. This time.
"One of the best Final Fantasy games in the series if not the best in my opinion.  Story rich, unforgettable characters, an epic journey and one hell of a time. This game is wonderful, beautiful, and eternally beloved by fans of the series."
"TL;DR: Best game of the franchise, music, story and overall feelings of a classic RPG.  I still cannot believe that this port happened, I felt a little afraid because the other ports have not been good at all, but since this is my all time favorite game I had to give it a try.  Pros:  *Great story, emotional and a life couching if I may.  *Amazing main character, the best of the series up there with Ramza Beoulve from Tactics.   Going against the typical darkish and negative-ish protagonists that the saga has provided until the IX release  .  *Each character is unique on their battle roles, so no over powered main character who does it all.  *Return to the basics of the series: the vintage classes, fantasy related world, empires, kings and whatnot.  *The variety of paths you can take to finish the game, each combination of characters provides many challenges.  *It is a damn long game to play if you go for the whole 100% thingy.  *Many minigames and secrets that really add a lot of fun time to mess around.  *The score is the best of the series.  *The old school feel was successfully ported.  Cons:  *To any RPG fan this game will result pretty easy to beat, once you get the hang of it.  *Not much replay value.  *Some minigames are just a grindfest to obtain things that won't matter that much.   ****SOFT SPOILER ALERT****  *  Although the villain has an awesome personality, I do feel it is too easy to beat him, same with the last boss, not what is felt against the secret boss, which is by far the hardest thing to beat on the whole FF series if you refuse to do the friendly monsters quest.      All in all the overall scoreboard:  *Music: 10/10.  *Playability: 9/10.  *Difficulty: 6/10.  *Characters: 10/10.  *Story: 10/10.  Overall Score: 45/50."

"The PC port is nice. I like the enhanced character models and cutscenes. One downside is the frequent sharp FPS drops during loading of the next area. If you haven't played the original game in Playstation, now's the time to play the PC version as it has the added features like the no encounter modes and max gil (though the 'game boosters' would somehow spoil the fun of playing the game)."
"I could write a long review talking about how it's the best game ever, but the time to write how much I have to say would be time wasted when I could be playing the game. Buy it, trust me it's well worth the money.  One problem I have though - Square Enix you useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, why couldn't you put the high resolution backgrounds in that were made for the game instead of the scaled down ones? HD characters on top of blurred backgrounds is ugly. Square Soft would've never done this."
"Can finally relive my childhood. No problems with the port, just get it!"
"A very good port, some hiccups in the loading but otherwise a great game and should be played by all."
The best Final Fantasy game to date.
This game has always been on par with Final Fantasy 7 in regards to story. I am so pleased that they finally brought this to PC and didn't change a thing other than adding cloud save support and buffing the character models. The soundtrack is the same as it was back on PlayStation. If you have never played this game before I urge you to buy it and playthrough this fantastic storyline. This so far has been a wonderful nostalgia trip for me. I bought this as midnight and played a couple hours and I actually am annoyed I have to put it down to get a couple hours of sleep. BUY THIS BUY THIS NOW!
"Add this to the slew of praise that this port is about to receive, but to be frank, it's well deserved.  This isn't going to be a review of the actual game, as I'm going to assume you already know it. But I just wanted to say that they did it! They actually went and bloody did it! They ported/ adapted/ remixed (whatever you want to call it) a game that was in sore need of love and recognition, and they didn't screw it up!   If, like me, you were worried that there would be some issues that would need to be modded/ fixed by other users to deal with the lazy ports of VII and VIII, then fear not! They got it right! It looks gorgeous, it sounds beautiful and you don't have to painstakingly set up any controls in the menu (I'm using a 360 controller, and it works like a dream).   I don't think they did much work on the maps as some of the backgrounds and their respective animations... they look a bit... choppy (e.g. the audience in the fight between Blank and Zidane), however that's not a problem, it was like that in the PS1 version, so it's no big deal. The character models look stunning too! Christ! They're incredibly sharp! The FMVs are wonderful too!  I cannot reccommend this version enough! If you loved the PS1 version, then you'll be blown away by this!   Also I kinda like oglops."
"Never got the chance to play FFIX on ps1 when I was a kid because I was never into these types of games. FFXIII was the game that actually brought me into this series.   But I really enjoyed this one.   Pros:  The characters are awesome, especially Zidane, Dagger, Vivi and Cid.  Good story Port is decent (it did lag a bit for me and crashed once, but didn't have any other problems with it) The villain is great  The graphics are good, especially the cutscenes.   Cons:  I can't think of any negatives.  If you haven't played it before on the ps1, its worth picking up. If you played it before, well you probably know if you want to pick it up or not.   "
"tl;dr: Overall it's a good port. There are changes to the UI, sound effects have been updated, videos have better resolution, characters are great, controls are ok.  - If you're a fan of Final Fantasy games, don't miss this release.  - If you have neve played this game on PSX, here's your chance, do it.  - If you played it on a emulator, It feels like playing it on a decent emulator, with the best possible quality, and also some dark magic improving models and textures (things a emulator can't do properly). Plus, it has all the charm of various language options, Achievements, Cloud Save and Trading Cards.  -- Comparisons to PSX version  UI: The UI was basically remade. It has touch support, which translates to mouse clicks on the PC side, and navigation using a controller feels mostly the same as it was in the console version. Player portraits inparticular look great. The downside is that it runs at a faster framerate than the gameplay itself, making some UI graphics shutter when it tries to follow a model character, such as damage text when a creature dies.   Music: It features the same music used in the original game, with a small difference. The PSX game had its music done using a sequenced with specific samples. The game can be speed up using the F1 key, which makes the whole game faster, except the music, making the battle encounters and battle spoils moments completely gone, and would make Mr. Uematsu quite unhappy. This version uses a compressed recorded version of the original PSX music, which leads to the best fidelity, but with a small impact on quality. If have a good ear for subtle things like this, it'll bother you a little; most people won't even notice.   Controls: Using a gamepad, it feels like a PSX, except for some parts of the UI, where it behaves slightly different from the original counterpart, such as the battle scene, where selecting the target of a skill is easier to select using up and down in the enemy list instead of selecting the enemy looking at him, using left or right. Inputting the character name is also different and quite counter-intuitive: I had to grab the mouse and click on the text box, and then click Confirm.  Models: The character models are great, and their textures also look great. The battle scene models remain the same as the original PSX game, which makes it look a bit outdated, which is fine, since we're playing a port, not a remake. Also about the battle scene, the level textures uses some filtering. It doesn't help, but doesn't hurt to have it. The prerendered backgrounds are fine just the way they were, also featuring the same texture filtering, also not helping nor damaging.   -- Veredict  Overall it's a good port. Being someone who played throughfully the PSX version, It feels like the psx version, with slightly better graphics. Being able to keep your save in the cloud and basically never lose it? Big plus. The things I miss in ths game: New Game+ and better storage of Tetra cards.   Score: 9/10   P.S.: Overall, It's a good thing they didn't redo the textures, the music or the levels. It would look like a whole new game, and at the same time, and perheaps not being par to current quality of games. In fact, if they were to rework the game, they should literally rework the whole game, not just the textures, and would end up like FF7, taking a lot of time and a lot of resources to rework the whole thing."

"What else can be said about such an amzing title? Beautiful story, great characters, Vivi. My favorite of the FF series, translated very well to PC, aside from minor glitches. Every now and again, your character may start moving in one direction, no matter what input you use. Just exit the game and restart, usually helps."
Overall worth the wait and worthy of the original game if you can look over the slighty big combat UI. :)  I strongly recommend the game.  
Upscaled models looks great but the new battle UI covered half of the damn screen :(  Everything else is great like how i remembered.
"Couldn't assign the Tab or Shift keys, and Cinna died in the first fight. I'll get over these due to the fact this is the greatest game with the greatest music ever made and it looks peachy"
Better than 7.
"After spending much time in the rotten, bleak, ash-filled nightmare that is Dark Souls III, playing this with cheats on is a major godsend.  In Dark Souls III the enemies plows through you like paper, in FFIX you (can) plow through enemies like wet paper. Exhilarating.  Highly recommended, ESPECIALLY if you need a break from Dark Souls.  I STILL prefer facing Dark Souls' bosses though than trying to highscore that Jumping Rope minigame."
"I've been a fan of Final Fantasy IX for over 10 years, so it's about damn time SqareEnix released this on PC! FF9 is usually hailed as either one of the best, or the best FF games released, and it's easy to see why. It's immersive, the story is pulling and the chracters have depth and, well, character.  It's a great game. The general graphics are dated (it's realse date originally was 2001, on the PS1) But for the PC version all cutscenes and character textures have been upped into a higher quality. To be honest, I can't really tell with the cutscenes, Squaresoft/enix were very, very good at getting the best they could out of the hardware at the time, and the cutscenes are still good. The auto-save has got to be one of my favourite additions. It's so much nicer than having to slog through the same bit to get to a boss fight again.   I have noticed one or two little things in the game that bug me, for instance (To avoid spoilers ((You haven't played this yet? What have you been doing since 2001?)) I'll play the pronoun game) On the Prima Vista, when the Knight jumps into the hole, there's a little sound of his armour clinking when he gets stuck on the PS1 version, not present here. Also, the little robot things that appear when you use Detect or Scan don't open their 'eyes' like they do on the PS1 version. I imagine, or hope, Square will look into updating the PC version to include these little bits and pieces"
"EDIT: If you're suffering from 'the controller bug' - just start the game with your controller disconnected, and connect it once the game is loaded. Worked for me with both PS3 and PS4 controllers on PC.   I found myself thinking 'amg so pretty' as I went through the game. Sure, this has been my favorite game since I first played it back in 2000, so I'm probably a bit biased. Still, if you played this game in the past and enjoyed it, you'll likely enjoy reliving it in slightly upgraded game graphics, and wonderful HD CGIs!  If you're only trying this for the first time in 2016, keep in mind it is an old game, and things were a little different 16 years ago. Still, I've always thought this game was beautiful (in almost every way, but here I mean graphically), and it's only improved on in this PC port. For anyone who's never played it - Final Fantasy 9 is perhaps RPG at its best. The story is simply amazing, with lots of humor, the game has endless optional adventures (I say 'adventures' because nothing in a Final Fantasy like this is as rigid as 'a quest'). The amount of depth this game has, and how well everything was designed, is outstanding even for today's standards. The (now in HD!) CGIs were used perfectly in this instalment, as they helped tell the story with beautiful and often touching scenes, and I can't wait to see them all again.  If you've played and liked it: You will love it.  If you played games of that era: You will probably love it.  If you never played a Final Fantasy: This is a great one to start with.. play it! If you like other Final Fantasy titles but never played this: You will likely love it.  If you liked older FF titles: You will likely love it. If you like RPGs: You'll probably love it.   For me, easiest and best 20bucks spent on a game in a very .. very long time."
"I've only played the first couple of hours but like many others on here i've eagerly anticipated the release of this game. One of the best in the series IMO and there hasn't been a better one since.   Don't listen to the trolls/idiots on here who complain about pretty much anything regardless of the fact we've waited for a port of FFIX for years!  If,like me, you appreciate the fact you can finally play FFIX with Steam achievements, controller support, graphical improvements and a few other neat upgrades then i suggest you buy this right now!  To those who are complaining, do you really think SE would put lots of money into a 'proper' HD remaster of this game when it's probably only got a small following and wouldn't make sense to invest a lot of money into.  No - stop whining and either play the game and enjoy it or don't! Simple!"
"Absolute classic. Probably my favourite game of all time. I have never wrote a Steam review before but feel like I owe the game a positive review.  FFIX has a brilliant story with well written characters, gorgeous pre-rendered cutscenes, has an emotion inducing soundtrack and an intuitive ability/leveling up system. There's also a card duelling mini-game which is pretty neat. The game lasts around 35-45 hours but can stretch for much longer if you try to do everything there is to do.  Now, for the PC port. There are a few small issues. The battle UI is rather chunky and takes up way more spare than it should do. The new and improved character models look great but they clash rather horribly with the 2D backgrounds. Hopefully this is something mods will fix? Who knows. These are the only negative things I have noticed so far.  The controller support works brilliantly, you can rebind the buttons if you wish. Battles load faster than the original PS1 version and you can enable a bunch of cheats like infinite gil or max level if you so desire but these cannot be disabled on the save file you activated them on, so if the story is all you care about this should cater your needs. All in all I would recommend this port wholeheartedly."
"Everything's working great apart from my Xbox One controller, which I have to disconnect before I start the game and reconnect after. Otherwise I can't even start the game. I do hope It will get fixed.  Other than that - this game rocks!"
"Probably the best Final Fantasy game on steam bar none, forget the overrated FFVII this is the game for FF fans!"
"Love it, I only wish this background on the left and right side would not be there, prefer widescreen :P"
Good port. Speed booster helped a lot. Story rich with a lot of character development and interaction.
I have waited for this for so long... And it didn't dissappoint!
"hmmm ..  The good :  character models are beautiful to look at .  boosters speed things up dramatically . some might find it off putting , but it's optional .  music and sound effect quality are good .   xbox controller support .  its FF9 .   The bad:  like others have said the back grounds are pretty washed out . its not enough to put me off the game , but it's definitely noticable from the get go .   the game has crashed on me with in an hour and a bit . updating geforce driver to see if thats the fix . have to see .  "
"Not really going to comment on the quality of the port, it seems decent enough. Wish there was an option to use the old character models, they clash a bit with the low res backgrounds.  FFIX is probably my favorite game of all time across any platform. It just has so much damn charm. And now we can use the speed boost to fix one of the issues with the original game (the insane amount of time it takes to enter battles to cover up load times)"
"Great game, takes me back to my childhood. Now I can finally beat Ozma!  The updated graphics look really good, but the old 'backgrounds' could of had a bit of work done on it. The screen kinds annoys me though, I understand they put a border on to keep the 'aspect ratio' for the game since it was made for square TVs (Yes kids TVs were SQUARE! And fat and bulky blah blah) but they could of left it black or gave us an option to remove it.  There is some MAJOR lag when loading battles which kinda sucks. Hope they fix it soon!  Anyway, if you're a Final Fantasy fan, your collection is not complete without this! Play it, and kick some fat queen ♥♥♥1 (Bonus points if you guess how many chins she has!)"
"You can enable speed boost, to make the game go incredibly fast for those who hate to sit through the story parts... An Auto-9999 with an auto combat system for those who hate fighting and just want to view the story... An auto-trace system to automaticly go into trace, when ever you want!!!!! SO much more added like lvl cap boost ect.... So funn!!!!!"
"Slightly torn because it doesn't look great on my wide screen set up and, while the models look wonderful, there is a huge contrast between the environment and the characters. It almost ruins the experience because the environment is so blurry and then you have these crisp clean characters. With this said, this is my favorite game ever. If blurry backgrounds don't bother you then you are good to go."
"This game is all the nostalgia that I remember when my youngest brother played it years ago. I've already had the whole, 'wait, how do you do this again' occur and it's only going to get worse from here and I love it. So many songs I've swooned over, so many characters I adored, and it's back in my life and right here on my computer. I'm so damn happy.  My only complaint is the awkward point and click option for the mouse, as it doesn't always work."
This is the best Final Fantasy game hands down. The menu and settings are not original but they feel close enough that I love it. This is a must buy for those of you who grew up with this game.
You need 5 cards to play a game dude....
I've been a Final Fantasy fan for as long as I can remember and playing this game again brings back so much memories. Can't wait to spend countless hours to playing this while looking back when it felt like to be a kid again!!!!
Great game so far
"Square Enix did a great job porting this game. The detail of the game looks much cleaner from the PSone, this game is a must own if you are into jrpgs! I played this before on the PSone and this will be my second time playing through. I definitely recommend this game! Peace"
for ♥♥♥♥s sakes square enix... is it that hard to test pc ports before launch. xboxone contoller bug renders the game unplayble. will be great once its fixed but im at my limits with square latley. please release XII INT for some redemption.
"Game looks and works great. My Xbox 360 controller works without problems, but I did have to reassign the A+B buttons which can easily be done in the game. The UI is not as bad as some others seemt o make it out to be and overall it is a very nice port of an old and great Final Fantasy game."
"Final Fantasy IX is easily one of the best Final Fantasies out there. Zidane was a breath of fresh air after Cloud and Squall depressed us with their emo mannerisms. All of the characters were fun and exciting. The story itself seems to transcend its own seriousness in lieu of light-hearted silliness and many many opportunities to get sidetracked with other activities, like Chocobo Digging and Tetra Master.   The PC release offers us help in the form of fast forwarding, easy skills, and max gil. I will admit to being tempted to use them, and I would recommend it for any buyers who lack the patience for an old grindy game, but there has been and always will be a feeling of satisfaction that comes with seeing your efforts pay off when you finally learn a new skill or level up after a lengthy grinding session.  I have heard a couple of reports of controllers not working, though my lame Steelseries 3GC works just fine, and I have seen people using the 360 controller reporting no issues as well.   The polished character models are fantastic! I can, for the first time, appreciate the detail that went into these characters. Faces that simply looks like colored blobs of pixels, now actually look like faces and their bodies have details I had only noticed in cutscenes and closeups. Unfortunately, the backgrounds were not upgraded. I have read that this is due to much of the original material being lost over the years.  All-in-all, I'll say that this game is worth the price, especially since it is discounted off the bat. I would have gladly paid $25 just due to the sheer amount of content in this game. You will get your moneys worth in this. Don't fret over how old the game is until you've seen how much is in it."
"Even if this game turned out to be a terrible port, it's likely I would still recommend it. Final Fantasy IX is my favorite game of all time and I could wax poetically about it for hours. I won't though. The port is well done, the new models look great, the HD cut scenes were beyond what I expected, and the slight changes to the interface are welcome. What can I say? If you've never played this game, buy it! If you've already played it, buy it!"
"The reboot is fantastic! The updated character models are wonderful and the soundtrack is just as delightful as I remember! The sounds are crisp and clear. The menus look so polished, and they even added boosters for people who don't have the time to grind away characters. Its not entirely revamped on backgrounds though, but it doesn't take away from the game. In my opinion, if you loved ff9, you will LOVE this."
I have waited for this for so long... And it didn't dissappoint!

Excellent jump rope simulator. Currently on 189 jumps. Will try again tomorrow.
They totally didn't screw this up. That alone is amazing!

"This game came out at an awkward time. it was either near, or after the ps2 release, so it mostly got swept under the rug.  If you are a final fantasy fan, TRY THIS GAME. while it doest offer as much character customization options as previous games (The characters all have fixed roles and classes) it is a game that tells an amazing story and you will enjoy it, I gaurentee."
this is the best final fantasy port so far. In my opinion this is the best game in the series
"Always been a good game. Loved how they made the main character a half monkey boy. ViVi is cute, Garnet is pretty hot for a pixel girl and Garret is just plan........Fooked up lol. All in all a very fun game!"
I just wished we could end this game together...
"Masterpiece. I had this game on PS1, PS3, and when I saw it on Steam, I bought it again."
The best Final Fantasy
"If you love the good classic FFs, you love this one to heart."
"i've spent about 10 hours on the jump rope game and have barely gotten to 20 hops, this game is so gud. 10/10 will waste time again."
"A great port of a classic game, with some added spices to speed things up a bit.  The environments still look great, despite the low resolution, and the new HD models are as crisp as can be expected.  If you loved the game when it came out, you'll still love it now!   This should be an instant buy for fans of the game. People that want a whimsical, original and surprisingly deep RPG that doesn't feel too japanese should pick this up on sale.    Game time does not reflect actual game time with the port - played it offline for about 8 hours.  "
"My personal favorite Final Fantasy game works just as well if not better on pC than on PSX. Do not try to use a sweet FX it will NOT work , but it does scale well up to 4k with side boarders than aren't to in the way. There is a mod that will remove this but I have not looked much into it. Has a few extra goodies for people that might be lazy and just want to rush through the story but I reccomend playing it once first before trying these as it can make it way to easy.  Buy this game , you know you want too."
"Many others better than I will tell you about FF9 as a JRPG, so I'll leave it to them. Just wanted to weigh in my experiences technically.  Works fine with Xbox 360 wired controller for me. Doesn't have the annoying pre-boot screen like FF8 and FF7, meaning I can boot this up and not have to go near a keyboard. Haven't tried it on the Steam Link yet, but I'm not anticipating any issues based on the above. Controls feel fine. In-game recognises Xbox buttons (telling you to press Y, etc.).  Sound is same as PSX. No midi here.  Graphics are along the same as FF7/8. Hi-res models, but muddy backgrounds. Occasionally jarring, but not too bad.  There have been some changes to the GUI, but aside from some resizing I'm honestly hard pressed to notice and/or care. The ones in this version work pretty well, that's all that matters to me.  Only thing I don't like is access to the game boosters from within the menu, rather than outside the game. Not end of the world, but occasionally worried I'll accidentally hit one of them (it says they're irreversible so would probably require a reload).  Game is not widescreen. Original game wasn't, so it makes sense. It has some textured edges to fill the sides. Honestly would've preferred it if they'd made it black, but it's neutral enough to not be too distracting.  Probably the best PSX&gt;PC FF port I've played so far. Nice to see that lessons have been learnt.  EDIT: For clarification, there is a launch screen, but unlike FF7/FF8 you can actually navigate through it with a controller. However, I did have some issues when trying to change resolutions and had to go back to my PC to actually do it. Once set up, I've been able to go through fine each time.  I've spotted a few graphical issues. Nothing major, but still annoying. Steiner's victory pose in battle, if the camera focuses on him, causes him arm to vanish.  Other than that, still seems to be running well. No other issues encountered."

"The music, the atmosphere and the system make this my favorite FF title and I couldn't be happier to finally see it on Steam.  This game is just a joy to play and I would recommend this wonderful adventure to anyone."
"easy,seamless gameplay. No lag great nostalgia value"
"A classic game and one of my all time fav, This remake looks really good and im happy its finally on steam I always enjoyed FF9 now Im going to take my time and do all the side missions and fights for the achievements :D im 15 hours in and its been great."
Not very far in game for PC still but I've played FF9 over a dozen times. This is by far my favorite of the Final Fantasy series and I have awaited its PC release for many years. I am slightly dissapointed by the fact that this happens to be a port from the mobile release but I still highly support this game and reccomend and rpg fan pick it up.
"So, I've barely touched the game, in terms of content, but it's certainly not a new game and I'm already pretty familiar with what it has going for it in that regard, and you probably are too. What's important is the actual port/HD conversion. And to that end, it's a little bit of a mixed bag that ultimately leaves me a little disappointed. The general HD-ification seems pretty good to me, with sharp redone UI that still retains the look and feel of the original PS1 version for the most part. Font is nice (unlike the other mobile-to-PC ports) and everything works well enough with a controller. Character models seem to have gotten a decent bump in polycount and their original textures have either been redone to a degree or at least filter decently. The static backgrounds have also been filtered a little, and look about as good as can be expected. FMVs run at the original 15fps, and the rest of the game is locked at 30fps. All this being said, I have two gripes, and I guess they are both superficial.  First, the battle HUD, particularly the basic party member info that is always displayed, is FAR FAR too large. It's apparent this was ported directly from the mobile version (despite taking over 2 more months to come to PC after both version were announced simultaneously), with no thought given to, say, scaling the HUD down to better suit the larger screens the game would be played on. Second, I'm shocked that there's no option to disable the static grey/textured sidebars that border the game on either side (or top/bottom, depending on your resolution) at all times. A simple toggle in the launcher is all they had to add to just allow for clean black pillarboxing, as an alternative to the currently forced images.  All in all, the total package seems like a pretty decent one, but it just seems very little additional effort was put into this particular version to set it aside from the mobile port released earlier. As with III, IV, V, and VI before it, IX seems like all the effort went into the mobile version and they just swiftly (or not so swiftly in this case) slapped it onto PC as well, without any thought given to the differences between the platforms. That being said, this is by far the best HD conversion/remaster they've done out of all the mobile-to-PC ports, as well as the other two PS1 titles ported to PC (VII and VIII). Everything's sharp and cleaned up nicely, yet shockingly faithful to the original, all around.  As of right now, if you can get past the two complaints I mentioned, I think you'll like what this lite remaster has to offer. With a few simple tweaks, this could be unquestionably the definitive version of the game. As of right now, I'd say go for it, but don't expect it to be perfect."
"So glad that this game is on steam. Brings back memories when I used to play this on the Playstation. Oh Tetra Card Game, how I missed playing you. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So far I have not encountered any problems! Game runs smooth.  Keyboard controls are not that bad; you probably wont need your mouse as much.  Music and sound isnt bad either. It sounds clear and original.  So, what are ya waiting for?? Buy the game~ Its so funnn. I can literally play this game all day, lols."
"I cried when i first played it, I cry again now"
"It is just like I remember it as a child. The nostalgia is so strong while playing it and I couldn't wipe the grin off my face at hearing all the familiar songs. Still, truly a great game."

"The music, the atmosphere and the system make this my favorite FF title and I couldn't be happier to finally see it on Steam.  This game is just a joy to play and I would recommend this wonderful adventure to anyone."
"This is by far the most polished, memorable and perfect FF out there. It's always been underrated and I just don't know why. It's not just nostalgia, it's just that this FF is unique in every way: the characters grow on you, the story is amazing and it has so much content... Amazing, this game made me love videogames 15 years ago and I just wish other videogames could make me feel what this one does.   I would give it a 10/10"
"One of the best console to PC ports in a long time for one of the best console games of all time. Even at 23.99, it is well worth the price just to hear that flute intro.   10/10, would spend the night crying from nostalgia again"

"So, I've barely touched the game, in terms of content, but it's certainly not a new game and I'm already pretty familiar with what it has going for it in that regard, and you probably are too. What's important is the actual port/HD conversion. And to that end, it's a little bit of a mixed bag that ultimately leaves me a little disappointed. The general HD-ification seems pretty good to me, with sharp redone UI that still retains the look and feel of the original PS1 version for the most part. Font is nice (unlike the other mobile-to-PC ports) and everything works well enough with a controller.

"I have owned this game many times, and tried even more to finish it. I never got far. My first introduction to the Final Fantasy series was 7, and that strongly shaped my taste in the series. When I first saw this game, I didn't get it. I understood this was going 'back to the roots' of Final Fantasy, but at the time I didn't have a solid reference point.  Well, I finally did it. I beat it. Granted, I cheated using the new boosters, so do keep that in mind. I just needed to finish it and see the story, that was my main goal, so I could put this to rest.  Cheating like this taught me something interesting about this series. I beat the story only in about 15 hours, skipping most battles. That means these games typically have 45+ hours of literally nothing but level grinding. That's crazy.  What was usually to me a 6 month endeavor, became a weekend speed run. And it was awesome. I really liked this game as a whole. Though I did have a few issues with it.  There is a lot of 'furry' type content, as well as pedophilia. For instance, the main character is a monkey-boy in love with a human female, and later aquires a 6 year old admirer. It's pretty weird.  Anyway. The story, music and graphics are great and this is part of the golden trifecta of 90s JRPS, FF 7, 8, and 9. The updated models really look nice, as even back in the day they looked very jagged.  I was surprised that the loading times into battles really doesn't seem that much better, even with fast forward turned on. That made that 45+ hours of grinding really laborious on the original, and isn't much better now. I haven't timed it yet but it's still an annoying wait for every single battle.  I'm going to play the others in a similar fashion to confirm or deny a theory I have that not a real lot actually happens in this game. I want to make sure it's not due to me rushing through it, but aside from battles there are only a handful of meaningful plot points in the entire game. I feel like many of the other Final Fantasies featured far more intricate plots and character development.  One cool thing that I'm not sure if the other FF releases on Steam have, is that it has a cutscene viewer once you beat the game. How awesome, I always wished I could easily rewatch those, pre youtube at least. Bizzarly, it also unlock a blackjack game on the main menu. Why?  9/10"
Melodies of Life T_T
This is a really nice funny beautiful game with a pure sweet feel to it i really like it a lot its like a breath of fresh air :O)
10 years ago that I wasn't play. . . . (then 9 years old and now 19 years old.)   Best FF for me forever kupo &lt;3.  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  So many moments that make you go 'Wow...'   The best RPG game ever made/story ever told.  The characters, story, settings, and for a large part the combat system, especially compared to other Final Fantasy's, is to die for.  The most under-rated Final Fantasy.   Small price for one of the greatest game ever made, easily, hands down. It also runs flawlessly, for which I'm very thankful.   This is all my humble opinon, but I speak from experience when I say,  You will like and may even fall in love with this game even if you don't like RPG's. It happened to me years ago. Very happy this title is on steam!  This one takes a little love and patience, but it pulls you in from start to finish, rewards you with all the good feelins of being moved at all the right moments, and by every little thing. Everything in the game is explained that needs to be, but not in an annoying way, more like an ingenius way that draws you into the world and characters more. It's also rife with mini-games, optional side quests, absolutley wonderful writing, humor and drama, choices for repeat playthroughs, and now, achievements. And other awesome things. Chocobos. The music. An abilities/elemental/effects/combat system that makes sense. Moogles.   At 1920x1080, maybe it's just the new models which are great, but it looks better than I've ever seen and I love it. Character's faces and expressions are now more visible, and less pixelated, I find this really adds to the value and appreciation of the game! This is a most welcome improvement. It looks a lot better, you can see things you couldn't discern what they were before.   + Controller Support  + New models that rock + cheat/hack features, However STRONG caution to NEW PLAYERS, I DON'T recommend SPOILING your FIRST PLAYTHROUGH with these!!! You have been warned, don't ruin the magnificance of the game, save it for later. (see update below for deeper explanation)  + Easily the best port I have installed, both in terms of quality of the game as a whole itself and how it runs as a port.  Oh, and the added 'auto' mode or, as I like to call it, 'JUST KILL IT!', is a nice touch. :)  And the speed hack (F1), when used together, these are hilarious together and great for grinding! Be careful though, better save every once in a while, lest you run into something and not notice quick enough that it's a battle you better pay attention to! I DON'T recommend auto mode when you are starting out in the beginning of the game or you could die, save first!    (3 extra points for the + above) Best FF, Best story, Best RPG, *Port of the Year*  The crowd applauds &amp; showers you with 1000 gil!  Queen Brahne was not impressed.  Princess Garnet was not impressed.   13/10 would return to a game I love, learning new things and laughing hysterically at many surprises in my playthrough, again.  Update: Finished the game...and I have to say, there truly are not many words to capture what I have to say about this game, but here goes. It's not just a game, it's a work of art, a story, myth or legend or tale, that inspires and enlightens those who choose to experience it. Playing the end again after so many years was definitely looked forward to, and I was moved by it all over again, with characters, their conflicts and their ever so wittingly written lines of dialogue relating to my life in entirely new and different, yet still the same old ways, like a great Miyazaki movie or something, for example.  This one, for me, I think will always come to mind when I think of the definition of 'a beautiful adventure'. Life is also a beautiful adventure, and the game mirrors that in its tones and lessons hinted at us through Zidane and his ensemble of whacky, multi-dimensional, determined friends.   As a final thought for those both returning to and especially coming to this game for the first time, It is my recommendation as someone who discovered the wonder of this title on playstation before these achievements or boosters or any of this, that your first time through you just play the game yourself. Don't use walkthrough's or guides unless you get stuck and really need to, then see how far you can get without needing to use one again. The reason for this is simple: There is no replacement for the wonder, awe, pleasure, fear, and so on, you will feel playing through the game for the first time without *exactly* knowing how the game works, or what is coming next, the next boss battle for example, and how to equip for it. Yes, this might leave you getting owned repeatedly at various time of the game and might even be a little frustrating at times, but this is another feeling this adventure produces to be appreciated.   As needed or when you've thoroughly discovered the 'wow' factor of the game for yourself, I recommend bover_87's guide on Gamefaqs, it's simple, easy to follow, well written and not without some humor itself that compliments that of the game. Again, you may be tempted to switch to using a guide full time, but I urge you to discover how far you can make it on your own, what challenges you can overcome even without knowing what the best items to equip for every battle are. This takes *some* of the fear, mystery, excitment, emotion over losing your characters in battle, for example, out of your playthrough, especially that first time. In a lot of modern games, you might want to avoid this, but NOT in this game! These are characters you grow with! Essentially, discover it like it was meant to be, first, for you;   DON'T SPOIL IT!!!   In fact, after losing to a boss once, just use select in menu on equipment and figure what you need to equip for/against, elemental wise (abilities for immunities to status effects/ailments)  So, I recommend saving heavy/continous use of a guide for your 2nd playthrough, and any use of the boosters for your 3rd or after. With the right guide, once you know what to equip, the boosters will seem unnecessary and threateningly boring, unless you're just playing through again to lazily blitz through all the combat and just enjoy the story &amp; atmosphere.   After finishing the game I can confirm everything I've written here, and say that it is definitely not a lazy port AT ALL, MUCH has been added here that improves the quality of this deal and it is most welcome. Watch any fmv from the menu, once beating the game, and access to the blackjack game, rather than the code one would input at the end screen on the original playstation, are a nice touch of features.   Game runs great and has no problems crashing, I don't think this game has ever crashed for me even once.   If you're looking for adventure, fantasy, well developed characters, very likeable writing, love story/romance/drama/humor, and all these things and more in a new and different package, look no further. IMHO No other Final Fantasy comes close to this one or holds much interest for me, this one is just on another level, and the CREATOR of the series itself Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi, has stated in an interview that THIS one IS HIS FAVORITE, and most accurately depicts what an adventure of 'Final Fantasy' is, to him, that he was trying to achieve. I believe I recall music composer, Nobuo Uematsu, also is quoted somewhere as saying this was his favorite score/soundtrack in the Final Fantasy series. If that doesn't raise an eyebrow/silence haters and ff7 fanboys, lol, I don't know what will. Oh wait, maybe playing the game!  As an added conclusion:  I recently stumbled across this blog post and found it quite agreeable and just had to include it here for others who are interested. If you're on the fence about this title, this is for you, nice sum up. (would've included the text, but it wouldn't fit, so here's the link instead...)   http://zfgc.com/forum/index.php?topic=30466.0;wap2   The character development really is phenomenal. I hope you enjoy falling in love with this game!!!"
"I remember getting FFIX on the PSX for my birthday as a kid. Now, it being released on Steam I feel almost as excited as way back then.  So here's what you do:  - Have Vivi cast Flare on himself with Auto-Reflect and Reflect x2 on and win the videogame. - Get to Memoria within 12 hours of starting the game to get Excalibur. - Collect emotional tears after finishing the game."
"One of the best FF's along with 7,8 and 10. Brilliant game and well worth buying."
"I love it! Hopefully we can soon get rid of the grey boarders but it isn't much of an issue. Game runs, looks great!   P.s to Squareenix: when you bring FFHX/ X-2 HD, at least gives us a release date! and port it from the PS4 version, not PS3 or Vita!   Thanks!"
"The first time I played this game in 4 years and even 14 years later I run it, to go from cover to cover. The best story of all the Final Fantasy series of games, incredible music and unforgettable characters, which was nice to watch throughout the game. If you have problems with learning or work, just sit down to play the game, you forget about all your misfortunes. Definitely the best part of all the Final Fantasy."
"By far my favorite Final Fantasy of all time. Square-Enix did an excellent job bringing this title to PC. From the moment I loaded up the game I was instantly brought back to 2001.   If you are a fan of Final Fantasy this is a must buy. If you liked the older games in the series than you are going to love having 4 player parties again. The combat is solid and fun, and the class system is amazing. Music great and story is one of the best in the series IMO. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game, you will not be disappointed."
"This is like the very best dream coming true for me. FF9 is easily my favorite game of all time. I have wanted to play it on PC for as long as I can remember. Now it is here and it is quite honestly much better than I expected! With much higher quality cutscenes, character models and portraits as well as in-game text and icons. Overall it just feels very polished and cleaned up compared to PS1 version of the game. I am constantly staring at the screen and noticing small things I did not notice before (like patterns on a iron sword or dagger). And each time I look at a CG cutscene I marvel how beautiful and sharp it has become. Knowing the amount of gorgeous cinematics this game has, I feel like I am in for a huge treat.  I have played the game itself many times so I know pretty much all there is to know about this game. If you have never played it before, know that this game is easily the epitome of JRPG in a medival setting. Everything about this game is absolutely perfect, and this pc port is definitely worth it even without any of the enhanced features."
Great Game. One of my all time favorites!
"Huge fan of the original, Love that it's finally here on PC."
"Let me kick this off as saying I still have my original PSX version of this game. Let me also say I started it up on my HD tv six months ago and nearly cried. I hoped that someday Square would release a port of this game because the original release looks atrocious on any sort of modern system. (Well, that and the fact that I live in constant fear that, after 15 years of ownership, my copy of the game is going to just up and die from the sheer amount of hours spent playing it.)   That being said, when they finally announced the PC port, I was incredibly leary. Square has not historically made good ports and I was loathe to shell out for a bad copy of a game I already owned. Having played about 30 minutes of the game, I have to say that my fears were part justified and part relieved. Here's why:  Kudos:   1) All the characters are HD, and they look great! For once I'm actually able to make out the details on the characters that were blurry to me in the orginal copy. The menus have been completely redone in HD as well, also removing that blurry, yet slightly grainy quality the old game has on modern screens I'm getting older. Crisp lettering is nice because I can read it.   2) Music is core to this game since it draw on several previous titles in the series and helps give the game it's throw back feel. It sounds CD quality here and not at all like a tin-y midi. Well done Square. Major improvement over the last port you did. (*cough* FF8 *cough*)   3) The cut-scenes look a bit better. Not jaw droppingly amazing, but, once again, sharper and smoother for the most part than the original game.   Fails:   1) THEM BACKGROUNDS!! YIKES! If this were any other game then I would probably not be as bothered by the fact that they didn't bother to upgrade a single background from the original game. However, for FF9, a major selling point of this game back in the day was the detailed, beautiful backdrops. In failing to fix this they made the contrast between the new HD characters and their backdrops absolutely jarring. The characters don't even look as if they're in their environment anymore because they're just too high def for their blurry backgrounds. It feels like 3D pieces on 2D game board. So much of the beauty of the game has been lost with these low resolution backgrounds.   2) Battle menu...perhaps I shouldn't put this under fails yet because my jury is still out for me, but the battle menu is huge. I'm not sure why they ditched the old one-window menu, but I guess it's because it worked better with the mobile phone port they ripped this from. (Makes sense. If your going to poke the screen to select the menu, you're gonna need some bigger buttons.) Not really sure how I feel about it taking up half the screen though because it blocks the art of the game. (Can you tell yet that I feel pretty strongly about the artwork FF9? One might think I even own the original artbook. Hmmmmmm...)   3) Needs a controller. Definitely. Trying to play with a keyboard is like trying to tap dance on a newly waxed floor: not impossible, but you're eventually going to hit the wrong spot and find your heart full of regret at your own foolishness."
i cant get the controlls down on my computer please help me 
"This is my favorite Final Fantasy.  +They did not screw it up.  +They did not 'fix' the game   I wanted a slightly better polished version of the game I loved on the PS1, and I feel that's exactly what I got.  I still suck at jumprope and Tetra Master though... I blaim Squenix for this...."
"This is by far my favorite FF game and absolutely my favorite story driven game anywhere. I haven't yet played it through on the PC but unless the port is garbage I have almost no complaints about this game. I've played it 3 or 4 times and Even watched/guided my friends through playthroughs a couple of times too! The few things that I don't like about it are as follows (Again, this is from the original, not the port, so technically it's possible these aren't relevant): 1) the battle system is a little slow. Even if you go into the menus and ramp up the speed as much as possible it's still the slowest atb driven FF game out there. 2) Some of the side quests are just luck if you didn't know about them beforehand or are incredibly tedious. There are a lot of items hidden around the maps that you can only find by clicking when you get an exclamation point above your head and many side quests (optional ones though) are primarially driven by this interaction. It makes for either tons of tedious searching, using a guide, luck, or just not finishing them. 3) Similarly, some of the side quests are simply poorly designed. The chocobo hot and cold quest in particular.  These things are all supplemental to the main game though and aren't enough to significantly impact anything. It's an amazing game with incredible characters and a really solid story. If you are thinking of picking it up, do so."
"I'll do a full review once I've gotten a little farther. So far this is a pretty decent port. Some quick notes:  PROS: + Port runs well, no issues at all. You can be under the requirements and the game will still run fine + Music is the same as PSOne + Remastered textures and polygons are a great addition + Controller support, although I've only tested on a wired 360 controller  CONS: - While the FMVs and textures for 3D objects have been remastered, the backgrounds have not. This creates a huge contrast between the player and background quality and can be a bit annoying - Not a lot of PC options and key rebindings can only be done in game and will only affect that specific file - I believe they still kept the original PSOne framerate, so expect 30 frames locked and dip to 15 in battles  EDIT: So I bought an XBox One controller and tried to test it on this game, even after the 2.6GB update that we got and it doesn't work that well. For some reason, the controlls are really wonky because it can't use the analog stick right. That said, the game is still fine and Keyboard controlls work just as well. If you need to use a controller, make sure you have a 360 controller because I know for sure that it works well."
"My favorite of the 7, 8, 9 line up and it's just as great as I remember it. Music is beautiful, cutscenes look great. My only problem so far is the diference in resolution between the remodeled characters and the backgrounds, which look pretty much like they did on the PSX, can be a little jarring at first. But you get used to it.  gg"
Very good port so far. Will update once im done the game fully 2 times. One for casual one for ex2 perfect...
*fangirl scream*
The best ff ever imao. Dev team did well to port this classic ps1 into PC. Better models graphic. Recommended.
"A Golden JRPG Standard  PROSE  +Square didn't butcher this port +Beneath 16 year old graphics, it's water-color-like art style shines through on 1080p resolution +Compelling Characters in a deep (and intricate) story +Final Fantasy's signature ATB turn-based system +Good humor +No random encounter (challenge) mode  KAHNS  -Gotta pay Square for it -1080p has 4:3 aspect ratio -Instantly level characters to 99  All-in-all, this easily the best of the Final Fantasys, but is certainly the best Steam port. It's not an obvious half-♥♥♥♥♥ port of a mobile game *cough cough *V *VI cough cough*, it's not half-♥♥♥♥♥ ports of DS games *Wheeze Cough *III *IV Wheeze* and it's not Midi-filled garbage quality like VIII. Until they get FFXHD and FFXIIHD, this is the best Final Fantasy on Steam and one of the easiest to figure out how to play and understand the story (I'm looking at you again, VIII).  100/100 Nobles, Queen Brahne is impressed, they shower it with 10,000 gil"
"Let's finally put it to rest gals and gents, in 2016, FFIX officially has better graphics than FFXII. Here's to Square for doing this the right way."
vivi is a bad ♥♥♥. beatrix was A1 beat-off meterial growing up.  9/10 still rub it out to her
"Works and plays just as it should. For those mentioning the high-res characters not mixing with the low-res prerendered backgrounds, try playing it on an old-school resolution like 640x480.  Yea, it defeats the purpose of have a 1920x1080 monitor, but...it will look very similar to the original game, so you can still have that nostalgic feel.  If you want a high-res, HD 1080p version of this game, you're pretty much out of luck (unless it gets a remake some day, like 7...though that seems unlikely).  Anyways, yea. Play it on a low-resolution and that PS1 goodness will come flooding back!"
"Fantastic port of a classic game. There have been certain visual upgrades, but overall, they stay completely in the spirit of the original Playstation game. Apart from the decidedly low-resolution backgrounds and choppy, PS1-faithful framerate, the game has held up surprisingly well visually."
"Out of the three Final Fantasy on the PS1 ( FF7,8,9 ) , this has to be the best port that Square has ever made . I've encountered 0 crashes, errors or bugs in my 33 hours of gameplay. Great remaster of the character model and awesome story, soundtrack and gameplay as well. The added booster is well appreciated as I've finished this game countless of times. Great job Square, now bring FFX/X-2 to Steam."
Excellent conversion with a few minor graphical issues. Add the cheat boosts to the game for those that want to use them and you have a quality throw back to the final Final Fantasy of the first Sony Playstation!
Not much to say other than simply amazing.
"The soundtrack is great. The story is rich, and I like the interesting characters. Game has not crashed yet."
I haven't ever written a review before but for those who know and love FF9 and are concerned regarding buying the title yet again i say this: the visual improvements on this game are stunning and well worth repurchase if you love the game. without a doubt my fav FF title and its great to see graphics that the storyline deserve.
"In my first hour revisiting one of my favorite games of all time I: -Sat in a room and repeated the same two lines of dialogue 64 times -Tried to jump rope 1000 times without failing...that ♥♥♥♥ right there is why i'm probably never going to 100% this game's achievements -Played a card game that I used to be obsessed with even though i'm still not quite sure how the card battles work, but in my first game Alleyway Jack took every card in my name -Repeated the same play scene about 10 times trying to get used to the PC controls and to impress the big blue ♥♥♥♥♥ to get a pretty rock  10/10"
"Finally they released this game on steam! This was one of the Final Fantasy games I played extensively on the Playstation, but I never beat the end.  This release of Final Fantasy has a sharp look to it for what they could improve upon, the interfaces are much smoother. The one thing I wish they would have done is the 'original graphics mode' that even FF7/FF8 had, even though they were on PC previously, so probably that is the reason they can't fall back onto it.  Many people are having problems as many people will on a game as such, and I hope all issues are fixed because I am supporting all releases of Final Fantasy (below 13) on steam so they can live on through a platform that many more people have access to than a PS1.  A very fun game to spend 100 hours into, and a 3rd favorite in my Final Fantasy books, but still has left an imprint on me growing up. Play it! &lt;3"
"The best feature in this port that's not well advertised is that the game saves every time you transition to a new screen. This tiny feature means I can pick up the game for 10 minutes and put it back down again without being annoyed that I didn't reach a save point and will have to repeat myself.  Also works with deaths. I died against one of the bosses, it put me right back at the screen where the fight started."
"A throwback into childhood. FFIX still got the magic touch of a fairy tale. And that with slightly improved graphics (Still looks very dated though. It's just a port, not a remake).  Great story, beautiful art design, interesting character development.   But goddammit, that rope-jumping! Ohh the rage! This stuff is harder than Dark Souls 3!"
"It is so nice to be able to play FF9 again. Now we just need X on steam.  Pros: FF9 back in your library, character models look great, runs smoothly, and I haven't run into any glitches yet.  Cons: Backgrounds are still from the original and haven't aged well, the game is not truly full screen and has ugly grey borders on the sides, some environmental models are messed up e.g. in the tavern the goblet is just floating in the middle of the air.  Overall: If you like FF9 just buy it. Ignore the nit-picky perfectionist people."
Someone please teach me to beat the jump rope game (1000)..need that achievement in my life.   You know what nevermind.......(GOTEMMM)
"***This will be just a short review of this game based on what I remember from playing it when it first came out. I will update soon after replaying the game.***  TRUTH: This will be the first review I write on steam.   The first FF game I ever played was FF8 and I never looked at a video game console the same way again. The story, the characters, It really was magical to me. I loved every second of that experience. There was nothing that could come close to, or even compare to, that game for me...until FF9 came out.   From the very start I was encahted. The opening movies were amazing, the dialouge is funny, and I enjoy reading it (WHO NEEDS VOICE ACTORS). Zidane is a typical cool guy rouge, and that is so different from his predecessor (the seriously serious Squall). I love the ATB system and turn based battle system in general. I know that in todays fast pace action packed video game universe the battle system in this game can sometimes feel a little...dull. However i assume the new 'boosts' they implemented will help you get over the hill when it comes to that issue. It's all about the story, the journey, for me, and this is one you don't want to miss. NOT FOR ANYTHING. The backgrounds and scenes are just amazing. They really help draw you into the story. The cut scenes are always great and exciting to watch. The relationships between the characters is amazing to watch and experience. No doubt by the end of this game you will have a new favorite game charecter in one of them. The lore and history of this world is exciting and fun to learn about. Admittedly, being back to castles and airships is nice too. Hey, don't get me wrong I loved FF7 and FF8, but to me this game really gets back to the games true origins, mages and monsters, princesses and knights. A true 'fantasy' experience. (with some crazy tech thrown in at the end) You really love the good guys and you really HATE the bad guys. Another positive thing about this game. As much as you can care about your party is about as much as you can hate the bad guys in this game. Just another reason to keep playing, to see 'em all burn HAHAHAHAH! ...eh hem. Look its an old game from a long time ago. It's not all flashy and what not, but It is a great game.   Honestly, I cannot wait to start replaying this game. It is all downloaded and ready to run. And I am just about to dive in. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this and do the same.   "
Nice port of one of the greatest games of all time.
"People who have played this game before and are getting it out of nostagla (like me!), will get the most out of it. For new players, it's still a great game, just keep in mind it's a turn based old style JRPG. I've been playing with a 360 usb controller and have had no problems. I haven't tried keyboard and mouse but for ease I do recommend a controller. The graphics strike me as a little strange. They did upgrade the cut scenes and characters but the backgrounds are washed out, 2D messes. Some people have said they have had problems with the game crashing? almost 2 hours in, I have had no problems with crashing or lag. The storyline is very enjoyable in my opinion and the music entertaining. I have to admit though the mini games is where I have the most fun, especially the card game! There are cards hidden through out the whole game and you can win new cards from the people you beat. My second fav is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. You can get some great stuff from that as well. Over all, I do recommend this game to most people. This was one of my favorite Final Fantasy Games and I hope to see the ones not yet ported come to PC sometime soon!"
"Final Fantasy IX is an amazing game that takes itself a bit less serious than most of the others in the series. The characters seem to act typical as to what you may expect, but its not always bad to play the role your best suited for in my opinions. so i'm coming at you with this short list of reasons to play and own this game.  -Chocobo Hot &amp; Cold game will suck up tons of time in the most enjoyous ways. -Vivi is hands down a must in your party cause he OP and just plain bad@$$ (Top 3 All time FF characters for me) -A story that makes you question your own existence and the reasons why you do what you do. (Cause you love it) -Plenty of CG cut scenes that really bring the characters to life. -Easy to learn trading card game built in that if you play enough jump rope, you can call it out from there on.  Finally A sexy princess to save, who's personality and determination is admirable and quite desirable.  One of the few FF games i've played through multiple times, and its time to do it all over again. PEACE!"
My childhood on PC.
One of the best FF's !
"They've done right by this port so far (just got to Lindblum). The only complaint I can even make is that I wish they also retouched the backgrounds. They're still beautiful, but it drives a contrast between the models and the background. Having them retouched would add a lot of enjoyment. That being said, this is well worth the full price, let alone the sale price."
Game is a lil harder then I remember. Still a very great game.
This game taught me that if I become emotional I can get a fever...
This is how you final fantasy
Is this a jump rope simulator or am I doing something wrong?
Very good port so far. Will update once im done the game fully 2 times. One for casual one for ex2 perfect...
i cant get the controlls down on my computer please help me 
"My favorite of the 7, 8, 9 line up and it's just as great as I remember it. Music is beautiful, cutscenes look great. My only problem so far is the diference in resolution between the remodeled characters and the backgrounds, which look pretty much like they did on the PSX, can be a little jarring at first. But you get used to it.  gg"
"The first time I played this game in 4 years and even 14 years later I run it, to go from cover to cover. The best story of all the Final Fantasy series of games, incredible music and unforgettable characters, which was nice to watch throughout the game. If you have problems with learning or work, just sit down to play the game, you forget about all your misfortunes. Definitely the best part of all the Final Fantasy."
"I remember getting FFIX on the PSX for my birthday as a kid. Now, it being released on Steam I feel almost as excited as way back then.  So here's what you do:  - Have Vivi cast Flare on himself with Auto-Reflect and Reflect x2 on and win the videogame. - Get to Memoria within 12 hours of starting the game to get Excalibur. - Collect emotional tears after finishing the game."

"In every way my favorite Final Fantasy, Hirinobu's final gem."
Only a short bit in and so far this is a solid port. If you liked the original game and enjoy replaying this kind of game now and then it's worth grabbing.
Who could dislike this legendary classic
This game taught me that if I become emotional I can get a fever...
This is how you final fantasy
A great port of one of the most amazing Final Fantasy games of all time.
Pretty good game. I recommend.
Game is a lil harder then I remember. Still a very great game.
"it runs smoothly as i expected and the graphics were amazing, it bring back memories when i play it again. wish all the character including the not-important one like NPC were all retextured not just a main character but that's ok, this definitely one of the best FF game ever made, Great story, gameplay, and character. not to mention the soundtrack hands down the best masterpiece human ever created."
"The best final fantasy, the one I thought would never see a port of, and I am glad I finally got one.   My wite bigger review in the future, just for now my two cents.  To the Devs: Please bring back the 2 player mode!!! I miss that mode so much!"
My childhood can now be shared with others =)
Out of 100 noblemen 52 would recommend this game. Queen Brahne was not impressed. She can suck an oglop.
Square-Enix discovered the trick to making good ports: get someone who isn't Square-Enix to handle it
This is a really nice funny beautiful game with a pure sweet feel to it i really like it a lot its like a breath of fresh air :O)

"The first and the last game I will ever buy on Steam. My first and will be my last game review. Bought this game thrice. PlayStation 1, Android and now PC. I want this game to be with me wherever I am. Says a lot about the game. Buy it. I don't care if you wait for a sale, or buy it at full price. Just buy the game whenever you get the money. It's a masterpiece.   And as for why this is the first game and will be the last game I buy on Steam, it's because I am a PlayStation gamer. The only reason why. No hate or criticism towards Steam. I made a Steam account just to buy this game. I am writing my first ever review just for this game. Hope this conveys how great this game is. I want it to be on my console at home (Yes, I still own a PS1 and a physical copy), on my Android device when I'm out and about, and my laptop when I'm at University. It doesn't matter if I'm not playing it. It's not like I play this everyday. I might play it once every few years. I just want it to be there with me. Always."
My sister and I used to play this all the time when we were younger. This game is pure nostalgia and I missed the little black mage! Love it.
Fun game to play and love the story :D
6Hrs of pure and only jumping rope game 10/10 Game of the year
It's a FF game. What's there to think about? Go buy it!
Best Final Fantasy game :D. So far so good. 4 steals for that mage masher!!!  PROS: -They give you mappings for both controller(ps3/4) and keyboard.  -Better graphics. Up to 1920x1080p resolution.  -New battle interface!  -New menu interface! I suggest you change walk to run ASAP! -There's build in CHEATS!!   CONS: -Built in cheats may be tempting... Heck at least its an option and it stays on for the rest of the game. So we know who the cheaters are! -30 FPS lock :(.    Will update after a few hours/days in.
"It's Final freakin' Fantasy 9.  Seriously. That's all you need to know. Buy it.   I've been playing Final Fantasy since the first once. The very first NES FF game. This is, hands down, my favorite one. This version is not without its issues, but the core of the game is there. Plus, it auto-saves to a quick load slot so you don't have to 'load' your game, you can just 'continue' it, so if you experience any issues you can close out and re-launch almost where you left off. That's very nice.  While the overhaul of character models is decent, it would've been nice for them to do something with some of the area models. There are times where you can't tell a door is a door or a hallway is a hallways because the maps, foreground/background, whatever... are all the original low resolution. I don't have any complaints about the audio quality not being what I remember... it's still the same. But keep in mind I haven't played the original in years so maybe I just don't remember correctly.  I have experienced a number of bugs... from game breaking (Zidane stuck walking in one direction, perma tranced, instant ATB, and invulnerable in battles... all at the same time), to just annoying (if you play long enough the interaction with stuff begins to take numerous button presses). It would be nice if SquareEnix patched and corrected some of this... but let's be honest, lately they just hammer stuff out and move on without giving any support to their products. And yet we continue to buy it all up.  In the end I recommend this because it is, afterall, Final Fantasy 9. The characters are great, there's a TON to do beyond the story quests, and it's just an overall fun game."
"I don't need to say anything about the game itself other than it's one of my all time favourite games.  I'm leaving an initial review to say that it ran up fine, was playable and looked fine on an old 1280x1024 monitor that I have at work.   The character models look like they have been sharpened up as well as the text dialog. The painted backgrounds remain the same, albeit a bit muddy.  I'm going to check it at 1440p tonight though I doubt it will change my reivew from anything other than a positive.   I have no interest in emulating nor do I have a PS1 to run the game on so it's great to finally be able to play this again.  Anyone who is moaning about black bars and muddy backgrounds should really just appreciate the game for what it is and leaving a negative review for that reason is a bit pathetic in my opinion. Go buy a PS1 and plug it into your 50' TV and tell me if it looks any better..."
"One of the best RPGs in history. Great story, lovely characters, inspirational music (nobou at his best!), graphics also enjoyable, fighting system is balanced and gives huge fun. It took some time for me to fall in love with that game when it was released on PS1 but after giving a real chance it turned to one of my favorites."
"If you've bought this game or thinking about buying it then you are :-  A. New Fan and want to know if this oldie is worth getting. B. A long time fan of the game so you just want to know how the new port is working out  Since there is no third option lets get to it, for those in group A,   Amazing storyline with some of the best twists in the franchise, memrable characters each with their own arch. beautiful scenery that blends magic and steampunk. gameplay and menus have been updated for a smooth transition making this one the best game SE has revived lately.  For those of you in Group B,  you know what... all of us in this group just wanted one thing out of this game., IT HAD TO RUN!! seriously you were willing to buy it so long as it just ran on your PC, that is the kind of fans this game has.   With that being said SE has excided our low low low looooooooooooooooow expectations of them. the graphics are beauitful, gamepad works well (though it can have some sticky moments in the speed events), Menu and model updates carry well on the PC port and movement is smooth (is it sad that we have to even mention this one?)   There is real issue with the game and that's the sound, it seemed the music and effects were compressed and carried over from the iOS port, the quality is poor so those headphones ARE going to give you a headache. do yourself a favour an lower the sound as much as possible until a mod/patch is out.  other minor issues :-  - battle frame rate seems to be on low side - on full sceen the game only plays in fixed size and has pillarboxs on either side of the screen. odd choice but you get used to it. - new save system is divided into folders with a number of saveing slots in each.... which would have been fine if the folder gets marked after you save in it but it remains with the default setting name meaning if you multiple saves then you have play hide and seek - To Quit you have to go Menu ----&gt; Config -----&gt; the VERY end of the page -----&gt; quit game. why they hide it is beyond me.  Aside from the sound being a bit disappointing this is one of SE's best port adaptation and you'll have fun even WITHOUT the nostalgia googles!"
FAVOURITE! FAVOURITE! FAVOURITE! FAVOURITE!
had a few isses starting up but now works well awesome game
11/10
"Absolutely a good port, finally. :)"
"Best game from my childhood, a timeless classic that i can play forever"
Review Available: Early 2016
"If you skipped FF9 when you were younger, nows the time to play! (also, if you skipped you're a god damn fool because its actually argueably the best FF)  IX is seriously the most underated FF to exist. Brilliant story, great characters and lovely graphics. This just polishes it off and adds a few more features to make it feel magical again. Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack, and not that rehash stuff from the FF7/FF8 steam releases. Im ready to get myself back in and enjoy Gaia again! (Until i get to a certain boss and cry/rage quit)"
"This is the best 3D Final Fantasy game ever made.  Before Final Technology Showoff X and Final Hallway XII basically tarnished the entire franchise, Final Fantasy IX came out.  Its a charming tale about a mother's grief, genocide, ethics, and fantasy. I would strongly recommend this to ANY RPG fan.  Will Chrono Cross (yet another classic from Squaresoft) come to Steam, too?"
Took so long for this port to finally come after the android and IOS came out. From the start this game brought back old memorys to one of the most loved Final Fantasy games of all time. custom keys was a little bit of a hassle to figure out. The game feels amazing runs very smooth. Sometimes I have to double click to get the chat moving along but it's rare.
"Best Final Fantasy. Port is unbelievable sexy.  It's fantastic, kupo."
The last Final Fantasy before the belt and zipper fetish took hold.
"Firstly, this is a great port. Maybe it's not even a port. That's how good it is.  The graphics are fantastic. They're just like the PlayStation graphics, but without the blockiness and low resolution.  Compare the screenshots on the Store Page with these:  http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/e/4/gfs_50278_2_12.jpg   http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/5/a/gfs_50278_2_25.jpg   Anyway, Gamepad support is vastly improved from the Steam version of Final Fantasy VII. For instance, where FFVII might give a prompt telling you to 'Press [CANCEL]', FFIX says 'Press (A)'.  Additionally, the B button is, by default, the 'confirm' button, rather than the A button as with most modern games. It was like this on the original release, back when Square was used to the Nintendo layout, and I like that they respected that.  Lastly, to give you an idea of how much fun I'm having, as of writing this I have played for about 2 hours, and taken 130 screenshots."
Ain't lousy
Its playable
"It smells like my childhood! 11 out of 10. Would waste hours of my life on it again .... oh wait, I am :D"
"So much nostalgia, and the game is really well done too. Thank you Square Enix."
FFIX -&gt; FFVII. Always.
Been farming the Choco Forest getting those Chocographs. Still haven't even passed so called disk 1 &lt;333
"When a person owns VII,VIII &amp; IX on PS1, PS3, and PC, then you call that person a Final Fantasy Fan. About this Version, was hoping it could be the original from PS1 and how PS3 made it original but I can't complain. I played long enough to the first save and I got say the graphics are simply amazing. They kept the PS1 controls so X(A) is cancel and O(B) is Confirm. I'm giving this Version a 10/10."
My review for Final Fantasy 9  http://finalfantasy9review.blogspot.ca/ 
"Beat Dark Souls 3 in 35 hours, blind and with no co-op.  Can't pass 48 jump-rope pulls after an hour of trying.  gg"
"The primary antagonists suck. Game is great in every other way. Best Final Fantasy in terms of characters, music, visuals, combat, and difficulty"
Spent the last two hours jumping rope. 10/10 jump rope simulator.
"10/10 Replay the game with main characters in HD to discover that Vivi is a muslim in real life.   You know,.. because everyone thinks he's a terrorist."
"I have played many games, But my favourite games are Final Fantasy series. It's a tale which is more interesting than other classic role playing game. I really recommend this game to every one."
The framerate suffered during combat but overall a decent port.
best final fantasy
Im a weeb so I enjoy this
Worst of the PS1 trio tbh
"I've always loved this game, so glad it finally came out on steam!"
One of the best Final Fantasy games and highly recommended version.
I Love this game. By far one of my favorites.
"By far one of my favorites. I really did try hard playing this on Playstation 1 but it didn't capture me so easily. That was 5 years ago though and my taste in games have changed. Now I decited to try again and wow what a great decision I had made. I am an avid Final Fantasy fan and love all the games equally but 3 games stood out the most, X,VII, and now IX. Everything from the epic story to the fluent gameplay makes for a genuine RPG. Another aspect I loved was the soundtrack. I mean wow, at some points it was powering and thats why I love Nobuo's work in all his games. So if for some reason you skipped by IX and thought it looked childesh or corny, I would seriously rethink that and try it. It is worth your time and money for any RPG player :)"
Highly recommend this game
"What can I say? I loved this game when it was first released, and I love it now that it looks even better! Though FF9 isn't my favorite of the series, it is still a very SOLID RPG. If you love older turn based RPGs you CANNOT go wrong with this one! They just don't make em like they used to."
"Final Fantasy IX was the last Final Fantasy game released on the original Playstation. It was their attempt to go back to the series' roots before enterring an era of futuristic titles. Did it work? Does it still hold up? Why don't we find out!  Final Fantasy IX is a JRPG by Squaresoft, released on the Playstation 1 in 2000. Like I said earlier, it's Square's last 'Fantasy' game before going for a futuristic approach. You play as Zidane, a thief and performer who's job is to kidnap Princess Garnet of Alexandria. When you reach the target, it is revealed that Princess Garnet wishes to be kidnapped. But why? And thus starts a timeless RPG classic!   As an RPG, you explore through the overworld, explore towns and engage in battles. Battles use the ATB system, as usual with a new twist: The Ability System. Skills are leaned by equping certain armors and weapons, allowing you to use spells and 'abilities'. Exploring caves and towns is the same as usual, this time they look alot better. Visually, this game is beautiful, the best looking game on the original Playstation in my opinion. With a few changes, it's still a Final Fantasy game, so nothing too new.  I find that it has alot of grinding, which is a bad thing. I've spent up to 5 hours grinding before a boss! Yet, then again, on that playthrough I ran from enemies alot, so it's not a big issue. Just don't run from enemies that often, the grinding isn't worth it.  In the end, Final Fantasy IX is a spectacular JRPG and a classic in the genre. It holds up well today and the PC port is great! Do yourself a favor and play this game, it's an experience you would not want to miss!  9.9/10"
"This is how you produce a port! I heard Square lost the original code and had to remake a lot of the assets from scratch. It was worth it! I sort of enjoyed the PS1 version, but with the improvements, this is a utter recommendation for any RPG fan. It's astonishing that this is so good and the FF6 port is so bad. I have nothing but compliments. Buy this!"
I will be the King of skipping/jump rope!!
I played this game in the past and now in Steam with the achivements and cards is a plus!!! Great details in the cinematics and it really fun to play. Love the story of this particular Final Fantasy.
"Many years ago I'd come home from school and immerse myself in FF9. It became an obsession.  And I must admit I got excited when it was released on Steam. This was the FF that I played most and enjoyed most so I immediately bought it.  It holds up incredibly well for what is now quite an old game. Good old fashioned turn-based combat and plenty to keep you occupied. If you're a fan of the final fantasy series you'll already be quite familiar with its appeal, and this classic drew me in all over again.  If you're not familiar, here is a basic rundown (no spoilers):  You control the main character, Zidane (or 'Tailboy' as some of us may have called him...) along with the usual crowd of Mages and Warrior types. As you progress through the story you come across random battles and bosses, where you control a team of up to four in turn based combat mixing attacking, healing etc. There are skills unique to each character which makes it worth swapping the team around from your eventual pool of 8 characters. By equipping certain items you can learn more skills and both active and passive abilities to make your team ready for any challenge.  The story itself keeps you interested and makes you want to carry on long past the point you were planning to stop.  Any downsides? I suppose the random battles can seem lengthy in loading and finishing so sometimes you may end up looking at your phone inbetween but generally I've found it to be rewarding replaying one of my favourite games.  Always worth having a guide handy to see little things you may have missed, the Chocobo side quest can be very rewarding (though grindy) and playing the card game can be good fun too.  For the money this is well worth it, and I feel far outshines the newer FF games.  Edit: I thought I'd add - you will be humming certain tunes FOREVER"
"SLIGHT SPOILERS BEWARE   I played IX back in '02 on ps2. Loved the accessibility of the port.  Just a few things that irked me about Kuja's char model updates, FMV sound, graphical, and text issues listed below.   I played to see the updated character models for Kuja and his higher res cutscenes. During the fmv scene on the end of disk 3 the sound crackled and popped and went silent every few seconds. This also happened during Bahamut attacking Kuja at Iifa Tree, and a few other scenes.   The sound overall in the game comes across flat in this port, as other's mentioned. Lacking depth. Kinda like a lack of depth perception but auditorially. It's all on the same plane. Was not like that in PSX original.  During the endgame char epilogues the last few words of their lines of text kept cutting off. And during the I Want To Be Your Canary performance, at the end of the credits, the auto advancing dialogue went way too fast.  The worst and most distracting element was that it looks like Kuja had female breasts. It's not there in the FMVS but his normal character model shows him as having a really bulky chest or it's boobs. I don't remmember seeing this in the original. It probably was too low res to show clearly back then. But I found it very awkward since in FMVs his chest if flat. Got nothing wrong with him having breasts it's just so random, and unexpected, and seems more like a glitch in the model.  And Kuja looks like yoda sometimes due to a texture on his forhead when he's injured. I couldn't take the scenes seriously because of it.   Kuja's outfit also looks less sleek and sinistely angular. His silhouette reads a bit awkwardly round and not threatening at all in this version. His sleeves are yellow while his skirt is white and this is inconsistent throughout. Sometimes being white and other times yellow.  Lots of invisible faces on character models and monsters when the camera is too close, faces as in poligonal sides being invisible. And some seams look broken like with Freya's tail- made it look cut in two a the end.  Had the running to the right and down issue on controller but after rebooting pc, game, and plugging the controller in after the game was up and then fighting the movement's wanted to go down by trying to make zidane run up and left I got it to unstick the movement.   Treasure chests not hidden behind background elements properly.   That's the stuff I managed to pick out.  I love being able to see Freya's eyes! I NEVER knew her eye color. She always looked like a cyclops. Now I can amke out what the other hybrid people look like. I love LOVE the higher res char models. Eiko used to annoy me to death but now that I can actually SEE her and the rest of the cast- they finally, really grew on me. Cried so many times, goofy smiles. pure delighted smiles, laughter, embarassment, cheering them on. Spent so much time guessing if the vertex lurching in the original was an emote or not and missed so much of the characters my other play throughs. They really came alive for me this time. Best play through ever.   BEST"
"Pretty good PC port, love the speed up xD saves so much time. No point saying how good the game is buying it again says it all. Using an Xbox elite contoller and getting a lot fo contoller bugs, such as opening the game while i have my contoller connect will break my game. have to open game with contoller off and turn it on once i have loaded my file."
"It's my childhood games and i'm waiting this for so long, long time.  I never though Final Fantasy IX will be remaked because Square Enix seems focused on FFVII and FFXV. So i think this game is actually underrated. But now this game is remaked and released so it's great!  One of the best PS1 game! Buy this if you support Square Enix games!"
"It is a great game because it was a great game. Almost everything Square Enix touched to make this port (because it's a pc port of a mobile game ported from PS1) has been to make the game worse (in my opinion).   Still, it is Final Fantasy."
"The best remastered FF classics, reasons:  1. X360 Controller works perfectly  2. Graphical enhancements on several world items and characters are good enough without ruining nostalgia feeling 3. Some musics and sound effects are improved but not whole 4. Some unique altered gameplay portions and character sequences 5. Last but not least for me is the Boosters, since I dont have enough time to farm all over again and just wanna play for the sake of story.  9/10"
"By far one of my favorites. I really did try hard playing this on Playstation 1 but it didn't capture me so easily. That was 5 years ago though and my taste in games have changed. Now I decited to try again and wow what a great decision I had made. I am an avid Final Fantasy fan and love all the games equally but 3 games stood out the most, X,VII, and now IX. Everything from the epic story to the fluent gameplay makes for a genuine RPG. Another aspect I loved was the soundtrack. I mean wow, at some points it was powering and thats why I love Nobuo's work in all his games. So if for some reason you skipped by IX and thought it looked childesh or corny, I would seriously rethink that and try it. It is worth your time and money for any RPG player :)"
The best Final Fantasy ever made.
Game stands the test of time. Great story and gameplay. A nice amount of sidequests that are fun to pass time.
One of the by far best games in the series(along with FFVI). Definetly a must-buy.
"The most underrated final fantasy game. I only have two real compliants, the first is the at style, it can really be annoying at times. The second is the villain's design."
What can you say about this game? It's beautiful... This is the purest Final Fantasy ever...
"One of the best Final Fantasy games, I love the style and the story."
the best of the plastation FF games
"Still just as good as when I first played it. Still funny, great characters, great storyline and minigames (Kweeehhh!!!). Only downside, background images have the same low resolution as they were in the original game. Other objects in high-res tend to stand out."
"I first played Final Fantasy IX on my hacked PSP some 8 years ago. After beating the game, I found that I loved it so much that I honestly felt guilty for pirating it, so I actually did something I (at the time) seldom did: bought a new copy of the game on PS1 immediately.  Jump forward to 2016, where I hear that Square Enix is re-releasing on Steam. The latent love I felt for Final Fantasy IX is still strong within me, so I bought it the second it became available.  I implore everyone to buy and play IX, because it is, in my opinion, the very best of Final Fantasy. It took Final Fantasy VI's and refined it to perfection; it had some of the most endearing characters ever put into a game; the soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu is perhaps his best work; everything about Final Fantasy IX is as close to perfection as an RPG has come.  So, with that said, I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone with even a passing interest in J-RPGs play Final Fantasy IX."
"I remember playing this game when it first came out. At the time, I considered it an 'under dog' in the Final Fantasy series because FF7 still continued to hold the spotlight for many and the Playstation 1 was getting old.  However, the game's steampunk style, charming characters, campy humor, and great music have made it a long-lasting classic in my book.  The graphics don't hold up today, nor does the pacing in some ways, but with the options available for speeding up some of the slower parts of the game and with the compliments above, I think the game still holds up really well!"
One of the best Soundtracks ever...
1st JRPG played
Excellent port. Builds on the classic with some upscaled CGI and animations.
This game will always be fun.
"This is my absolute favourite of all the Final Fantasy games, the port is great, it still holds up, and is absolutely worth checking out."
I cannot express in words how much I love the soundtrack to this game. And the game itself.
"Best story, Great music. Remind me the old style of Final Fantasy.  PS : Still don't know the reason why they add cheat feature like Maximum Level, Unlimit money in this PC version."
this is the best final fantasy game i have ever played and no matter how many time i play this on pc or ps1 i always find a new part i never played before well worth sinking 40-60 hours into a run threw and the doing it all over again
"XBOX360 controller here - no problems. Backgrounds - yes, rather awful, but that part which have been remastered - it's very-very good. Also loved injected speed boost and no-encounter plugs. Loved that - but Excalibur 2 witht that will be pretty easy :)"
i love this game and i always will i first got this game when i was 9 as me and my sister then 10 loved ff games anyway we went so stay with our grandparents for the summer hols in the uk annd a few weeks into it we went to a game shop so my sister could find ff7 but i found 9 and wanted to buy itknowing it wasnt 7 anyway my sister fliped her ♥♥♥♥ started crying wanting 9 off me so my grandparents made me give it her so i did and she brought it went back she put in the ps1 found out it wasnt 7 cryed to my grandparents end of story i spend to next week playing ff9 and falling in love with it and the bonus was i never payed for it it was given to me asshe was being mardy lol anyway game review buy it as you will love it
"Very good game and so glad to finally see it make its way to the PC.  A few things to note: - Quite a few people are noting some pretty bad issues with controller support, I personally can't speak on behalf of that because there is not one game I enjoy playing with a controller so I never do. I thought I would mention that though for the people looking to play this with one.  - Graphics. For me, I don't care too much about the graphics. This is an older FF title so in today's standards the original didn't look all that pretty and I didn't buy this newer port expecting it to be either. But I will say the HD retouches on the cinematics made me giddier than a schoolgirl.  With all that out of the way I did thoroughly enjoy playing this on the PC and am not regretting the purchase.  This one also has some cheats in it like Fast Forward, Trance mode always-on and a few others that I forgot what they do. I personally think playing with most of them would ruin the game and so I didn't. I did however use the Fast Forward function while trecking the map... One thing I've always hated about RPG's is when they make you go to one end of the map and then walk all the way back, if I wanted to do that I would have bought something with a title like 'Walking simulator 2016'. The Fast Forward function was a beautiful way to get rid of that"
"If you're looking to revisit FFIX, I highly recommend this version over emulation. This port includes a graphics upgrade and many quality-of-life improvements thrown in.   The character and enemy models look vastly improved, and overall the game looks great except for some especially low-resolution background art in a handful of areas (particularly in the beginning.) It feels like a different game.   I am playing entirely on the keyboard with no issues at all. The nice thing is If you're using a keyboard, the game will refer to the actual keypads instead of the controller's buttons.  For veterans, the nostalgia value is off the charts. I also recommend new players to give FFIX a try. For streamers, this game is a must.  Rally-ho!"
"I'm more of a FF8 kind of guy,  but I'll give this game 100 impressed nobles out of 100.  If they port Chrono Cross to PC, Queen Me would be impressed..."
OMG!!!  It feels like i'm still dreaming. The best final fantasy that i loved to play countless times during my childhood is now here on pc.   Thank you so much Square Enix :)
"Great game, I have played this many times back in the PS1 days.  This brings back all the great memories, Definatley one of the best FF games!"
My favorite FF game and believe me when I say that this version looks amazing! Like it kicked my Vita's ♥♥♥. I own this game in every form and I have to say the price tag for this version is absolutely worth it! With the fast foward button you can finally get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Excalibur II without breaking your freaking PS1 to do it!   Fair Warning: I use an Xbox One remote to play and yes there are some glitches but to make sure it doesnt happen just plug it in after starting the game and you have like literally no problems. I
"Love the game so far. This is one I was never able to play before so there is that as well. Really enjoying it, though I am hoping for an update or mod to deal with the background fuzziness. This doesn't really take away from the game for me but a fix would defiantly add to it.  I recommend this game if you are a FF fan you are sure to enjoy it."
"I've played all of the single player FF games ever since Final Fantasy I came out. This one is my favorite. And this PC version is one of the best versions I've seen that really improves the game since its release. The cheats are available if you need them (I do, since I've beaten the game several times before). The graphics are beautiful, much better than when I used an emulator to play it. The resolution looks really good. Even my young son is playing his FF here! Highly recommended!"
"I would love to play this game, but I can't for the simple reason I can't move. I have tried re-downloading and installing 3 times, but run into the same problem. At the start of the game after the beginning dialogue, my characters generally just wants to keep going left. Although, I have no problem opening and moving throughout the in-game menu. Fix this major problem please.  EDIT: Sadly only XBOX 360 controller works for this game that was ported from Playstation."
Hours can be lost playing Tetra Master.
Fantastic. Perfect. I cried at the end. +1
"likely the 2nd greatest FF game that has been made, yes, ff7 is a cult classic, but FF6 is clearly the best, with this cutting somewhat close, making it a pretty good game."
Everything I was looking for.  A good nostalgia feeling and my favorite final fantasy
This game is still Awesome and it has a lot of reply value and no matter how many times I finish this game over the years I still play it.
"We live in an age where 'the menu looks different but it doesn't detract from the experience' is far above and beyond what is expected from PC ports of old Square games.  Please consider nominating this game for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award."
"Though it might be a somewhat simple remaster of an absolute masterpiece, it still delivers the same magnificent adventure that was originally released over a decade ago. This time it contains some revamped textures and so-called boosts (that I would not recommend for anyone taking on the game for the first time), it's definitely a game worth considering."
"Of the three original PlayStation Final Fantasy games, FFIX is my favorite. I think it has the best setting, characters, and most engaging story. The battle system is fun but similar to most other turn based RPGs. It also has my favorite sound track that I have listened to multiple times outside the game.  The port works great. I don’t love the look of the new UI but it works fine. I haven’t run into any bugs or problems new to this version. The new modifiers are nice to have for replays. "
Nostalgia reared its ugly head. And boy do I love it.   For those who never played the game the decision is simple:  if JRPGs are your thing then Final Fantasy IX is mandatory. if JRPGs are not your thing then Final Fantasy IX is not mandatory.  for the rest see below   Features:  plethora of mini-games hefty amount of items to collect grinding (O! glorious grinding!) well-hidden secrets lot'sa treasure chests  and best of all . . . genuine satisfaction for achievements.  Unless it is the jump rope achievement. That is just satanic.     
Play this when you were a kid? Buy it now.
Really good JRPG crashes occasionally but with the new feature of being able to continue from the last room you were in it is never I big deal. I would still reccomend saving though as it literally saves with every screen
A fantastic update to an already stunning character-driven story.
"A true timeless masterpiece! One of the greatest JRPG's and games of all time! A relic from a bygone era, in which JRPG's were at the very peak of their game. A precious gem that should be played by folks from all walks of life. This game simply cannot be missed in one's lifetime. A game that will be remember forever and will always carry a special place in gamers' hearts. Enjoy one of the most beloved games that will leave you with memories that will take your breath away! A perfect 10/10"
"Let's my favourite FInal Fantasy of all time? Check.  Innovative, and imaginative story? Check.  Massive character development? Check.  I love this game, everything about it, the music, the storyline, the humour, everything is just perfect. I feel that this was the pinnacel of the Final Fantasy games. On top of that this is probably the best sent to PC Final Fantasy so far."
"I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, and IX is probably my favorite. I like the updated graphics, the characters seem to have a kid of painted effect. I had one problem though, in the ATE where Cinna, Marcus and Baku are at south gate, Cinna got stuck running in place and I had to restart the game because the scene hung and wouldn't progress, luckily the game has an autosave that saves inbetween each screen transition. I have a bad habit of not saving when I binge play RPGs, but if that autosave wasn't implemented, and if I had to redo a few hours of gameplay and grinding, than that probably would have been the end of me playing FFIX on steam.  TL;DR Buy it. FFIX is amazing."
"Blast from the past!   Absolutely loving the FF's on Steam. Only quibble is that I now have no reason to be keeping my old PS1 or the discs. I mean, who didn't love playing for hours on the old consoles only to have the game freeze up and loose a few hours game play?   All I need now is for the husband to hurry off to work so I can play!"
"It's my childhood games and i'm waiting this for so long, long time.  I never though Final Fantasy IX will be remaked because Square Enix seems focused on FFVII and FFXV. So i think this game is actually underrated. But now this game is remaked and released so it's great!  One of the best PS1 game! Buy this if you support Square Enix games!"
"It is a great game because it was a great game. Almost everything Square Enix touched to make this port (because it's a pc port of a mobile game ported from PS1) has been to make the game worse (in my opinion).   Still, it is Final Fantasy."
I will be the King of skipping/jump rope!!
Fantasic four game. anyone who plays this will be in for a true adventure.

"If you've played FFIX back in PS1's golden days, you'll be hit with a major nostalgia bomb so hard, you'll wish all FF games are on Steam right now. However if you're part of the new generation of gamers today and never played FFIX (or any PS1 games), chances are you'll find some eye glaring flaws that we oldtimers didn't noticed back then.  Just so people know, FFIX is arguably one of the best JRPG ever. Not my favourite JRPG but I can see why other people loved it so much. Just remember the generation gap this game has before buying."
"Thank you Square for bringing this game to Steam, because i did play this one but never complete it, i knew it was a great game, i only made it to disc 2 so didnt know too much about it, but i can say right now, after playing and complete it its my favourite FF of all time, the more i play, the more i think its perfect, amazing story, amazing combat system, best chocobos of all time, they do everything, and i found my favourite FF character of all time Vivi.  Until now my favourite FF was X , wich i still love it and i think its an amazing game, but this one taked the spot that X had. This steam version is a little different from the original one, better textures, the character models are much better, you have boosters like 9999 dmg hit, advance time, gil max, and other stuff, some boosters are activated via menu others you need to pause the game and press F1 to F5 i think. This boosters you might wanna use them if you wanna get the Excalibur II since you have the No encounter mode. This is my review for this game, if you never played it try it, if you already play it still buy it because you know this game is awesome xD."
"I was nervous after the FF8 port being the mess that it was that one of my favorites of the Final Fantasy series was going to be demolished by an official PC port. I'm happy to say that wasn't the case.   The addition of the game boosters allow for more variety in playstyles, and generally speaking the graphics upgrade looks fantastic in the cinematic scenes. However, some backgrounds were scaled with less grace and frankly look a mess. Scenes where scene and character models collide suffer the worst and can seem pretty jarring (the scene near the start where Vivi is introduced is one of these - if you encounter it and think it's unbearable, turn back).   The addition of the mouse controls are interesting, but finnicky. The default keyboard controls are also weird imo, so if they bother you, hit 'v' asap and switch them up to something more logical. The game does manage to switch fairly seemlessly betwen the mouse controls and the keyboard, though, which is nice.   I'm pretty simple with my desires from ports - I want it to look good, sound great, and generally not interfere with my love of a classic game. Overall, I think this meets those criteria, and even adds in some bits which some may find good use for. I'm still early on, though, and will update if I encounter any inexcusable problems further down the line."
"After getting stuck in this game when i was a kid, i decided to replay it and beat the game for the story.  Game has a rich story, beautiful sound track, a combat system that i quite enjoy. The card game is alot of fun and I'm still working on getting better at it.   I will say this game has some very heart felt moments.(There was a few tears for me)  Combat can seems a little slow at times. But there is lots to do.  Advice: Will say that, you will need to grind out levels fairly frequently. Leveling all your characters will help in the long run. Exploring the map will be useful."
One of those games that shaped me as a person. One of my first games as well. Never since have I experienced a game so incredibly wonderful that I have bought it in every possible medium multiple times. I will never not recommend this game to all who want a long experience filled with fun and excitement! 1000/10
"This is honestly my favorite of the Final Fantasy's, and I was so happy when they finally got the port into steam.  And boy did they do it right. Literally the only thing I dont like about this port is that the character models are sometimes TOO crisp to the backgrounds. Since they updated the models, but not the backgrounds, this is sometimes offsetting.  However, that is literally my only complaint about the port. Absolutely great, and so happy it came.  Now Square Enix...... Could you do some Dragon Quest ports please? :D"
"One of the best JRPGs ever made, hands down."
"One of the best Final Fantasy games from my childhood, they said they couldn't bring it to pc but here it is!"
"This is my favorite game of all time. I played it every year atleast once since I was eleven years old. I can´t praise it enough.  The PC version, which I have been waiting for a long time has some nifty tools to adress some of the few problems I have with it. Battles in the PS one version took FOREVER, in this one, you can speed them up. One of the more tedious minigames, Chocobo hot and cold, can be sped up too. And if you want to just cheat and enjoy the story while you blaze through, you can do that.  10/10"
"This game. THIS GAME. This was my intro in RPG's. My mother brought it home, confiscating it from a student of hers, and gave it to me when I was maybe six or seven. I loved this game. I remember every part of it. I replay it and watch the cutscenes in tears... Existance is something we all seek to justify, and you find that everyone's existance is special. No matter how short it may last. This game is a 10/10, and sits as the best FF game in my opinion, 7 can eat my butt."
My favorite final fantasy game with X and VI being very close behind. It still holds up to this day. The graphics are OK. They couldn't upscale the backgrounds but they were able to drastically improve the character models and remained very faithful to the original artstyle (unlike the mobile versions of other final fantasies). The music is the best of any Final Fantasy to this day. Definitely get this game if you bought it and enjoyed it on the ps1. Don't even question yourself about getting this game if you never played it. It's fantastic.
"I got this game soon as this came out on Steam because the game is a big part of my childhood. What got me really excited was the improved 3D models and HD quality CGI cutscenes but oh god, the music. It was super downgraded compared to the PS1. I hoped for a patch or a mod to solve this problem but then people found out the music was not badly compressed but the awful quality came from the way the game process it. That's a very big letdown to me. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the gamepad bug hit me like a truck, and playing this on M&amp;KB was too weird for me. Yet, all the improvements, especially the HD cutscences, they brought me back in time. That thrill whenever the CGI kicks in - it refreshs my childhood memories a lot.  And that's why I paid for the Steam Controller just so I can play this gem in peace. What I enjoy most is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. I know a lot of people find it annoying, but the feeling of improvement as the chocobo levels up and becomes capable of finding new treasure is freaking great. Bottom line is this game is a great game. Full price may be a bit much but on sale, this is a must get."
"Well, yea."
HELP I try to launch the game but nothing happens!!!! the only thing that pops up is the video settings pop up
"Spends 10 hours jumping rope and remembers good old fashion Auto-Clicker.... I knew those days of Runescape would come in handy someday!  10/10 Oh look, a card game!"
I no can eat until it weaker!  Taste bad!  I no can eat!  10/10 would try to eat bosses again
Good port! Sound and Graphics are spot on. Character movement on the field seems way faster than in the original. I can walk way faster than you can run in the PSX version.
"This game crashes for me, I do not understand why. There are times when it will crash when transitioning to a scene or a different area."
"I love this game, but Tetra Master can go die in a hole, preferably alone."
"I love this game, it's great and has a nostalgia factor once again for me. But I wish there was a fix for having my xbox one controller attached when the game loads. I always have to make sure it's unplugged before starting the game for some stupid reason. Not sure why that happens, but it still pisses me off. Excellent game, but controller support is kinda sketchy for me."
Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Couldn't steal anything. Stole Potion!  11/10
"Cinna dies 99% of the time, everytime."
Love it! My favorite FF! Graphics are great! Story is great! Memories are great! Everything about this is GREAT! Now would you please bring us 10 and 12!
That jump rope left me a broken man.   Love the models almost seem brushed in at times.  
"This is one of my favorite FF games from the PSX era! The graphics where the best the system had to offer and a compelling storyline to go with it. Now it's on PC and look better the ever!  Runs buttery smooth! :)  Why are you still reading, buy it already!!"
"It's FFIX. It's great. Buy it.   P.S.  The game has 7 cheats built into it. 3 are in a menu (max level/gems, infinite gil, max ap), and the other 4 can be toggled in the pause screen with the triggers and bumpers on your controller (max damage, bombs never explode, 2x speed, and some other cheat i have yet to figure out). So if you suck at FF, here's your chance."
"Thank you, Square Enix, Thank you! For finally bring a masterpiece to the PC.  I love it, the gameplay, the story, Everthing I love about this game is all here.  Despite the negetives that some people found on this game, I find it one of better ports of any of the others ports on steam.  HD models are great and nicely done and the music from the first release are all here. Even though the background pictures are still the same and the change of UI menu, isn't going make not finish this game, because I'm having and that's matters.  I am determined to finish to they end and have a good time. ;)  So yet again, thank you Square Enix!"
"This is possibly one of the best ports of any Final Fantasy game. I've run into very few bugs and haven't had any crashes, very pleased in that regard.  For the game itself, it has plenty of Final Fantasy nostalgia, a great cast of characters, secrets galore, a rich world, memorable bosses/villains, and a great leveling/ability system that's easy to grasp. Also, it has a fairly hefty achievement list that'll keep completionists busy for a bit longer.  The updated graphics are definitely a nice bonus and while I haven't used any of the new boosters in-game those options are available for speeding up battles, mastering all abilities, turning off random encounters, etc.  Couldn't be more pleased with this re-release of one of the best FF's in the series! Highly recommend to any rpg fan!"
"Final Fantasy IX is by far my favorite game. I've finished it 9 times on playstation one and now, on steam, I could finally see the details of my favorite characters since its now in HD. The remastering made it all even more beautiful and magical. I just finished the game and I'm tears again, the plot is epical! Game mechanics are also great, with chanlenges and fun sidequests. If I had 3 days left, I'd probably spend it playing it again.  This game literally saved my life, gave meaning to each of my days and forged me into who I am. I own all to this 8 fellows."
What an amazing pc port. The character models look even better then the original and the boosts are great. I may have had countless hours to grind up abilities as a teenager but being able to max them with a boost is great now that i just want to replay the game for fun. Highly recommend for anyone who use to play this game or missed it when it first came out.
"By far one of my favorites. I really did try hard playing this on Playstation 1 but it didn't capture me so easily. That was 5 years ago though and my taste in games have changed. Now I decited to try again and wow what a great decision I had made. I am an avid Final Fantasy fan and love all the games equally but 3 games stood out the most, X,VII, and now IX. Everything from the epic story to the fluent gameplay makes for a genuine RPG. Another aspect I loved was the soundtrack. I mean wow, at some points it was powering and thats why I love Nobuo's work in all his games. So if for some reason you skipped by IX and thought it looked childesh or corny, I would seriously rethink that and try it. It is worth your time and money for any RPG player :)"
"'This game shows how a proper Final Fantasy game should be made--it's not about the graphics, which is what Square-Enix has been doing it wrong since 2001.' 10 / 10  Let's get it out of the way. This is a good port, with some dents that need to be ironed out but it's nothing major. If you are looking for a HD Remaster or Remake, this is not for you. Yes, all the FMV have been re-rendered in HD and are skippable.  What's new? Boosters. Some of the useful ones include turbo and no random encounter mode, which would be incredibly helpful when you are doing speed runs for that Excalibar II. Most of the in-game character models have been re-rendered in HD. For best result, run the game in windowed mode in 4:3 aspect ratio.  If you like Vivi and want to see him in full HD glory, get this game now!"
One of the best Final Fantasy games and highly recommended version.
"a good pc port for once, if just for nostalgia or just for fun great game."
love this game but wish they would cleanup the blurry background
"What can I say? I loved this game when it was first released, and I love it now that it looks even better! Though FF9 isn't my favorite of the series, it is still a very SOLID RPG. If you love older turn based RPGs you CANNOT go wrong with this one! They just don't make em like they used to."
"I've loved FF9 ever since I was a kid. It was the first final fantasy my dad ever bought! An once I set eyes on Zidane, I was hooked.  Steam's version of FF9 is spot ON! The colors are so enhanced that it knocks the ps vita version, I had a 2 years ago, out of the water!  Other than the analog being weird to move, it's the best version of FF9 there is! (o^+^)b"
"Among any Final Fantasy fan, most of them all have different ideas of what the 'best' game in the franchise is. I can't say that IX is definitively the best, but it's definitely up there as far as quality games in the series goes, and for a good reason.  The story is one of the best I've ever seen in a JRPG. All of the characters are lovable and hard to forget. My personal favorite is Vivi, the young Black Mage. Without spoiling too much, he goes through a lot of difficult things, mostly existential, and if you're anything like me it will probably make you cry.  The graphics are wonderful, even to this day, although the character models have been upgraded. There are complaints about how the backgrounds are blurry, and well, they are. But when you're focusing on playing the game you kind of don't notice after a while. The FMVs are beautiful looking for a game that came out on the PS1.  The battle system is great, still using the ATB system like the older games in the franchise. This means you can choose to be active to fight in real time, or you can wait, which lets you go through menus for items and magic. There's also Trance, which lets your character become stronger for a short period of time. Abilities are given based on what items you equip, each of them having different effects in battle.  To those wondering, this game isn't stretched to be fullscreen, because it will still show grey borders at the sides. I have it on 1366x768 and it still shows the borders. I personally don't care, but some people might be turned off by it.  Overall, this game is amazing, and if you consider yourself a JRPG fan you would be doing yourself a favor by playing it. I feel like the price is a little too high right now, though, even for such a great game. When it goes on sale, it's a definite purchase."
"As one of my favourite games of all times (in my top five for sure) and an integral part of my childhood, this classic JRPG has always held a very special place in my heart. But even when I put aside those rose-tinted nostalgia goggles, I can safely say that this one is a timeless gem and well worth playing if you haven't done so yet.  I've played through the entire game and completed all side objectives multiple times back in the PS1 glory days, when FFIX was in its original 4-disc form. When I found out that this perennial fav of mine was being brought to PC in a remastered state, I was overjoyed-- and also, like many other fans, a bit worried that the port would be of poor quality. I anxiously awaited its release, and when it finally came out I was extremely relieved to see that the game was nearly perfect. They even kept the quality of the lovely and memorable musical score intact.  The character models look better than ever in high-res, and for those less fond of that JRPG grind there are now optional cheats to breeze through the game (though I'd never touch 'em, personally. I'm an FFIX purist like that!)  Controls work fine with either a controller or keyboard/mouse, but I recommend using a controller as that is the way the game was meant to be played.  The only issue I've got (and it's a relatively minor one that not much could've been done about) is the blurry backgrounds, which in most PC resolutions are quite noticeably fuzzy. This is unfortunate, as these pre-rendered backgrounds feature some very stunning art and help to create the game's amazing atmosphere. But fortunately they can still be appreciated, even in this state. It's far from a deal-breaker, at least for me. It bugged me a lot at first, but I can deal with it now.  The story and its characters remain as timeless and charming as ever, and it's the same emotional thrillride for me that it's always been. I will never stop adoring this game, and I'm really pleased to have it back in my life.    TL;DR --&gt; An above-average port of the best Final Fantasy game of them all. If you haven't played FFIX yet, you're missing out."
This is the most incredible video game that has ever been made. Nothing and I mean nothing has ever held a flame to this game. I have adored this game since I was a child and it has never come close to being pushed aside as my favorite of all time. If you like Final Fantasy and you have not played this you are missing out. I could not recommend this game more.
"One of the best of the Playstation Era. I think it holds up spectacularly, and for me at least, it has a nice 'warm blanket' feeling. A must play jrpg, and in my opinion, the last of the great Square rpg's."
"Best game ever. Bought it when it released in 1996 and have been looking forward to playing it via pc since they announced, couldn't have spent my money any better."
"Ten outta ten, 10/10 a 100 out of 100, best game. Best game."
"Port is interesting. It definitely needs work (fps mainly imo) and could have been much better on release (very annoying bug involving analog stick movement on a wired 360 pad), but I felt within the first few minutes of play that my purchase was a good one. I have loved this game since its original release and if you did as well I can't see any reason to not buy this version other than a desire to wait for a sale."
This game is great it looks so much better than the original with HD resolutions so glad it made it's way from the ps1 to pc. It has a very diffrent art style from the original ff titles you meet a lot of characters that look like animals i mean you play as a monkey man if you can get use to the world and characters your in for a blast.  Brings back the old gamplay from older ff titles.  You want to get the master thief it will make it a lot easier to steal things further in the game and also bandit abllity if not you have a very low chance of stealing rare items from bosses since the steal rate is quite low 5% i think on some rare items. There are some really cool looking weapons and spells the pc version shows how much detail is in the weapons because of the HD res. the mini games are quite fun cards and choccobo digging-treasure hunting the only side quests that's not that good just my thoughts though is the moogle ones dilvering mail and relaxing on every beach in the game but it's optional you don't have to do it. if you can get to the end of the game in 12 hours you will be rewarded with somthing awesome
"I see that many people who got this game have played it when it first came out on the PS1. I did not though, so this not just a port of a game for me but also a whole new game altogether. so please bear with me if i say something that might come out as obvious.  that asside, I think Final Fantasy IX is definitely a god game  the game looks nice in terms of graphics, or at least, as nice as it can be. the gameplay is simple but effective and the story is really interesting, it has a nice build-up to the main plot and the characters are likeable. The game is also a throwback fest to older final fantasy titles, and its nice to be able to spot all those references  that being said, the game, or at least, the port, is not without its faults  although i did say the game looks great, it can be a bit of a clash between the high-res character models and the low-res pre-rendered background. some sound effects are way louder than others, and its a little bit anoying when you can't have the option of just turning the SF volume down, only have it on or off.  in terms of plot, yes it has good pacing for the main plot, but it has the tendency to give some backstory to other characters to only then never touch at them ever again. it only gives development to certain characters, giving something lackluster to others or simply none at all (I'm looking at you Quina. though they are a comic relief char so maybe its ok?)  for gameplay, there's not much i could say against it. Yes it has some game breakers but so does every other final fantasy game.  overall, although not perfect (far from it actually) its certainly a fun game and i definitely recomennd it to anyone thinking of playing it."
"A fantastic port and wonderful game. As someone who played it for the first time on PC, I enjoyed every single moment of this story and the game is phenomenal. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to get in to it, or is a fan of the original."
"Perfect game, perfect port. Still one of the best Final Fantasy games to date. The feels are just as real now as they were when I was twelve.  Only complaint is that the Cloud Save (Steam Sync) would sometimes lag between my main computer and my computer in the bedroom to the point where I would have to transfer the cloud save using a USB stick, but I've dealt with worse hiccups."
"If you are a FF fan but haven't played this yet, do yourself a favor. I can't praise the writing of the dialogue, characters, and story enough. The soundtrack is legendary, the best in the series. The updated character models and enhancements of this edition are great too."
This is easily my favorite game of all time. This is the second game i ever owned. I previously played this on the orginal PSone with all 4 of those disks and cannot tell you how many times i beat this game and yet I still want to play again and again and again. Everything about this game is a masterpiece.   I love collecting every trading card and collecting every piece of armor and weaponary.   Please just do yourself a favor and buy this game. Easily best money well spent.
I'm so happy I can play this game on PC ;-; 10/10
"Best game in final fantasy franchise, love story of this game , Would Definately Recommend. A++"
"Still my favorite Final Fantasy game so far. It has the best characters out of the series and I love how the game actually went back to a fantasy style, unlike almost every main Final Fantasy Game from VII and after."
"Works well with touch screen inputs! You can move, talk and play cards.  Still need keyboard or controller. Really want an overlay for touch screen for menu etc"
So... The final game of the Playstation Era powerhouse has the full steam makeover and it doesn't dissapoint  This is the most unique of the Final Fantasy series .   For the First timer it may seem to drag a bit in parts but bare with it and allow yourself to get into the story  I think the Mods should become available after a full play through as to give players the nostalgic feel of the Playstation version

"Great game, i think this and FF 6 and 7 are my top 3 after playing this one. Really nice story and funny/adorable characters. Vivi is freaking awesome, best Final Fantasy character swear to god! Only thing that sucks about FF9 is the slow ♥♥♥ battles, takes forever to get through random battles sometimes. Atleast they have cheats so you can speed up parts of the game if you get impatient like me lol.   I highly reccomend playing the game if you've never experienced it when it was released (like me). Such a good game!"
i see that were a bit of negativity about this port but its been great to me and love it people complaining about blurred backgrounds here and there lol i mean come on what did they expect for a re release atleast it possible to play with an achieve system and its a legal way to play
"The nostalgia when i first got PS1, at first the pixellated low quality background is kinda annoying to be looking at but after playing it for a while it will blend in with the game it self.   Nothing wrong with the transition, the gameplay is nice. so far almost 3 hour just to get out of that Alexndria. damn, that was a very long wasting time exploring the city, playing card game, do the hopping rope and trying to get perfect score in the sword fight."
"Great game so far, and even better that you can use the controller as well as keyboard. Shame that you can't make the game full screen. And now and then it does seem to crash the whole game out of nowhere, not sure if it's a technical glitch or it's my laptop. But it's good to reminise this game from when it came out after FF8."
I will be the King of skipping/jump rope!!
Did you like the original ffix? did you ever wish it was on pc because you didn't want to find the original copy for like $100 or play it on the ps3?  Well it's here now with settings like max level and unlimited trance 20/10
An all time favorite of mine. This is a game I can sink countless hours into and never grow bored.
"The best remastered FF classics, reasons:  1. X360 Controller works perfectly  2. Graphical enhancements on several world items and characters are good enough without ruining nostalgia feeling 3. Some musics and sound effects are improved but not whole 4. Some unique altered gameplay portions and character sequences 5. Last but not least for me is the Boosters, since I dont have enough time to farm all over again and just wanna play for the sake of story.  9/10"
"SLIGHT SPOILERS BEWARE   I played IX back in '02 on ps2. Loved the accessibility of the port.  Just a few things that irked me about Kuja's char model updates, FMV sound, graphical, and text issues listed below.   I played to see the updated character models for Kuja and his higher res cutscenes. During the fmv scene on the end of disk 3 the sound crackled and popped and went silent every few seconds. This also happened during Bahamut attacking Kuja at Iifa Tree, and a few other scenes.   The sound overall in the game comes across flat in this port, as other's mentioned. Lacking depth. Kinda like a lack of depth perception but auditorially. It's all on the same plane. Was not like that in PSX original.  During the endgame char epilogues the last few words of their lines of text kept cutting off. And during the I Want To Be Your Canary performance, at the end of the credits, the auto advancing dialogue went way too fast.  The worst and most distracting element was that it looks like Kuja had female breasts. It's not there in the FMVS but his normal character model shows him as having a really bulky chest or it's boobs. I don't remmember seeing this in the original. It probably was too low res to show clearly back then. But I found it very awkward since in FMVs his chest if flat. Got nothing wrong with him having breasts it's just so random, and unexpected, and seems more like a glitch in the model.  And Kuja looks like yoda sometimes due to a texture on his forhead when he's injured. I couldn't take the scenes seriously because of it.   Kuja's outfit also looks less sleek and sinistely angular. His silhouette reads a bit awkwardly round and not threatening at all in this version. His sleeves are yellow while his skirt is white and this is inconsistent throughout. Sometimes being white and other times yellow.  Lots of invisible faces on character models and monsters when the camera is too close, faces as in poligonal sides being invisible. And some seams look broken like with Freya's tail- made it look cut in two a the end.  Had the running to the right and down issue on controller but after rebooting pc, game, and plugging the controller in after the game was up and then fighting the movement's wanted to go down by trying to make zidane run up and left I got it to unstick the movement.   Treasure chests not hidden behind background elements properly.   That's the stuff I managed to pick out.  I love being able to see Freya's eyes! I NEVER knew her eye color. She always looked like a cyclops. Now I can amke out what the other hybrid people look like. I love LOVE the higher res char models. Eiko used to annoy me to death but now that I can actually SEE her and the rest of the cast- they finally, really grew on me. Cried so many times, goofy smiles. pure delighted smiles, laughter, embarassment, cheering them on. Spent so much time guessing if the vertex lurching in the original was an emote or not and missed so much of the characters my other play throughs. They really came alive for me this time. Best play through ever.   BEST"
"Many years ago I'd come home from school and immerse myself in FF9. It became an obsession.  And I must admit I got excited when it was released on Steam. This was the FF that I played most and enjoyed most so I immediately bought it.  It holds up incredibly well for what is now quite an old game. Good old fashioned turn-based combat and plenty to keep you occupied. If you're a fan of the final fantasy series you'll already be quite familiar with its appeal, and this classic drew me in all over again.  If you're not familiar, here is a basic rundown (no spoilers):  You control the main character, Zidane (or 'Tailboy' as some of us may have called him...) along with the usual crowd of Mages and Warrior types. As you progress through the story you come across random battles and bosses, where you control a team of up to four in turn based combat mixing attacking, healing etc. There are skills unique to each character which makes it worth swapping the team around from your eventual pool of 8 characters. By equipping certain items you can learn more skills and both active and passive abilities to make your team ready for any challenge.  The story itself keeps you interested and makes you want to carry on long past the point you were planning to stop.  Any downsides? I suppose the random battles can seem lengthy in loading and finishing so sometimes you may end up looking at your phone inbetween but generally I've found it to be rewarding replaying one of my favourite games.  Always worth having a guide handy to see little things you may have missed, the Chocobo side quest can be very rewarding (though grindy) and playing the card game can be good fun too.  For the money this is well worth it, and I feel far outshines the newer FF games.  Edit: I thought I'd add - you will be humming certain tunes FOREVER"
"Pretty good PC port, love the speed up xD saves so much time. No point saying how good the game is buying it again says it all. Using an Xbox elite contoller and getting a lot fo contoller bugs, such as opening the game while i have my contoller connect will break my game. have to open game with contoller off and turn it on once i have loaded my file."
I have played through the entire game at least 5-6 times on the original PS1. This PC version is exactly what I was hoping for in a port of what is my favourite JRPG of all time. The models are updated and everything looks beautiful. The soundtrack is just as good as you remember it being. Plus the built in gameshark (game boosters) option is great for replay value.  Anyone that has never played FF9 before will find that it is easily one of the greatest JRPGs of all time. The setting and gameplay combine to create one of the deepest and richest stories that you'll ever find in a video game. The return to rigid jobs (classes) among the characters brings the series back to its roots while also incorporating what made the later games (such as ff7) so great.  I'd recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of JRPGs.
"Since basically all PC-Ports these days are awful I don't expect much from them anymore, but this one is actually awesome and improved in just the right ways. Thanks Square Enix. The game itself is obviously great and i had a ton of fun replaying it. My body is ready for FFX Port"
Another lazy port of a good game
"Cinna dies 99% of the time, everytime."
Love it! My favorite FF! Graphics are great! Story is great! Memories are great! Everything about this is GREAT! Now would you please bring us 10 and 12!
"This is one of my all time favorite final fantasies. I always enjoyed the fact that you could really relate to the characters especially Vivi. I only have one major complaint and that would be the lack of widescreen support. It will allow you to choose 1920x1080 but it has borders and I hate borders. Come on square-enix, this is 2016 and we all have widescreen monitors."
"My favorite Final Fantasy game, and they didn't screw it up. The one and only complaint is, Square didn't add a volume control in game. It will be extremly loud on intial launch, but turning it down in the Windows volume mixer fixes that."
"So what's the new Final Fantasy port like you may be asking. Is it as bad as the other ports Squeenix has offered us in the past? Well I have good news for you all, it's actually fairly decent. FF9 was the game that really got me into gaming all those years ago, and having played the original more times then I can count I'd say this port is pretty decent.  Some common complaints so far are: (1) It's battle interface being huge, (2) the game being a straight android port, (3) controller support being finicky and unpredictable, (4) bugs, (5) achievements not being locked if you use boosters. Here's how I've experienced these complaints so far:  (1) The battle UI is a great deal bigger than it was on the Playstation, however it never really bothered me and I quickly got used to it. I thought I would hate this aspect of the new release, but it bothered me less than expected, and I must admit that having all the options available on one screen was sort of nice. Your milage may vary over whether or not this is a huge issue in your enjoyment of the game.  (2) I can't tell you whether or not it's a straight port from mobile to PC, but it seems to have been adapted to fit the PC even if it's just in minor ways. Regardless of whether or not it is just the android version spiffed up, it seems to work really well on PC (and I'm still on windows 7, so it's not even necessary you have windows 10). The reason I think that it being the android version bothers people is because we all had to wait for 4 months while android users got it in January. That leads one to think that Square just wanted to milk the mobile release, even if that's not necessarily the truth. Anyway, it's still fully playable and feels like a PC experience, for anyone wondering.  (3) I have yet to have a single problem with my Xbox controller. However several people have reported that there controllers are either too sensitive, make characters walk one side, or don't work. I have no idea why there seems to be problems for certain people, but keep in mind your controller may or may not work.  (4) I'm at the very beginning of the game and have encountered one bug so far, when Zidane fights Boku for the first time. The screen stays black and won't continue to the fight screen. I fixed this by following a thread that said to put the contents of the x86 folder into the x64 folder. However I still sometimes have to pause and then unpause to get to the battle screen. Several other people are also affected by other bugs. Hopefully these will be fixed with time, but for now it's touch and go.  (5) There are several boosters in the game that allow for infinite money, no encounters, etc. Using these boosters doesn't turn off the ability to gain achievements. So be aware of that if the importance of achievement legitimacy bothers you.  Here's a list of the things the game does well: -Sprites and cutscenes look very nice and HD. You can finally see the details of the characters faces (and wonder in amazement at how you never knew x thing about that character model before because of the distortion). Some may find the blurriness of the backgrounds to be distracting when you have such HD sprites, but it didn't really bother me -Nice achievements and cards. -They haven't really changed the story or characters, the original game's integrity is still intact. -Music is a decent quality. Nothing exceptional, but they didn't completely butcher the sound quality.  tldr: has some bugs, changes some of the UI, but is playable and still largely the same old FF9 we all remember."
"This is one of my favorite FF games from the PSX era! The graphics where the best the system had to offer and a compelling storyline to go with it. Now it's on PC and look better the ever!  Runs buttery smooth! :)  Why are you still reading, buy it already!!"
"It's FFIX. It's great. Buy it.   P.S.  The game has 7 cheats built into it. 3 are in a menu (max level/gems, infinite gil, max ap), and the other 4 can be toggled in the pause screen with the triggers and bumpers on your controller (max damage, bombs never explode, 2x speed, and some other cheat i have yet to figure out). So if you suck at FF, here's your chance."
"Thank you, Square Enix, Thank you! For finally bring a masterpiece to the PC.  I love it, the gameplay, the story, Everthing I love about this game is all here.  Despite the negetives that some people found on this game, I find it one of better ports of any of the others ports on steam.  HD models are great and nicely done and the music from the first release are all here. Even though the background pictures are still the same and the change of UI menu, isn't going make not finish this game, because I'm having and that's matters.  I am determined to finish to they end and have a good time. ;)  So yet again, thank you Square Enix!"
"This has always been my favorite Final Fantasy game ever and unfortunately one of the more underrated Final Fantasy games out there. I had VII and VIII, but Final Fantasy IX is the one that really got me into Final Fantasy back in the days. Final Fantasy IX has the most in depth story line and best soundtrack. The characters are all likeable and unique. The character devolpement of each one is very nicely done throughout the game. The improved graphics and character models look so clear and crips which is very nice. There is definitely so much to do in this game and lots to explore. Final Fantasy IX is definitely a game where you find yourself getting so immersed into the storyline and characters. I'm very pleased that this is very true to the original game. There are lots of achievements to get, added optional boosts and cheats too. If you ever played Final Fantasy IX on the PS1 then you definitely should get this. If you have never played Final Fantasy IX then definitely give this game a try, you will not regret it."
"While my preferred entry in the 'holy trinity' of the Final Fantasy series is VIII (to many's chagrin), FF IX has always been a solid entry and one I generally look forward to revisiting every few years. To begin: FF IX is a fantastic JRPG. A decent story, great characters, and simple combat. There's not a lot of depth here, but it's overall a pretty fun game.   The entire reason i'm writing this review, however, is to critique this particular port of the game. Overall, it's a decent enough port, but does have some issues.   I've yet to find the cause, but the framerate feels a bit laggy compared to the PS1 original. It doesn't hamper the experience too much, but it is noticable. Additionally, Xbox One controller users (and potentially other controllers) have a weird bug associated with them that causes the selections to freak out, and the only way to resolve it currently is to turn on your controller AFTER starting the game, which doesn't have a 100% chance of success. For XB1 controller users with the wireless adapter like me, that can be very frustrating, especially because FF VII and VIII worked perfectly fine with a controller even if they required something like XPadder to assign controls. Once you gor XPadder configred, you never once had to worry about controls again.   The graphics haven't been improved much, but natural AA and higher resolutions available to the PC offer much clearer models with more details visible. Backgrounds are not as clear as you would hope, but ah well.   Overall, it's a decent port of a great game. I personally feel that VII and VIII recieved better Steam versions, but they have the advantage of actually having existing PC versions. If only IX was as nice as Lightning Returns PC is, then that would truly be something to celebrate. There's nothing so wrong here to prevent a purchase, however.   "
"Finished my first playthrough of this game after a couple other FF games, and I think I have a new favorite! Nothing else to say, really, except that it would be complete if someone were to mod in Beatrix as a full-time party member."
Still a classic! Def need to change that combat UI though. WAYYYYYYYYYYYY to big! Its ok then theres only 1 or 2 party members but when theres 4 it takes up neary 1/4 or your screen. other than that I love this game
"An excellent port of a classic PSX game.  The Thai team that revamped this game did a phenominal job of making it native to the PC. Not only does the port run incredibly smoothly and without glitches that I've found, it also looks incredibly crisp with the graphic filters they used.  All character portraits have been redone into HD versions in the menu (no more looking at Freya on the menu and trying to figure out WTF she looks like.)  Even in battle you can tell when the numbers come off the enemy during an attack sequence that they've been redone and re-animated. All fonts are clear and easily legible in high resolutions, all menus look great. Honestly, if you haven't played this or in my case if you really really wanted to beat it 10 years ago and never got around to it: this is by far the best way to play it. It blows any other final fantasy port out of the water thus far (not counting the recently released FF-X/X2.) If you played FF7 and FF8 re-releases on PC, this is significantly less half-♥♥♥♥♥. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.  Otherwise the story is decent, this FF has more of a 'kiddie' or light-hearted feel to it, but it's not entirely juvenile. Some facets are cool, but have modest gains. Most notably the Tetra Master card game; while not as punishing as FF8's triple triad, is considerably more lackluster. The cards are there for nothing other than collection value, whereas in FF8 you could use them for refining spells to add to your arsenal."
well worth 
This is a brilliant game - no less predicted from the Final Fantasy series. I got to admit that I'm a fan and that might color my review quite much. This game works surprising well with the Steam link and the controller.
It`s so epic and now steiner looks shemale in hd! only cons are theres no 60fps and no 16:9 and also the UI is too big.
"Just a stunning game, its one of those few games where, when you finish the game and the end 'story' unveils you become happy. Usually I become a little sad when finishing a game, as the ending is not what I hoped for, but Final Fantasy IX really has a great ending."
"Not a bad game. Stories for side characters feel a little forced, as if they did not have time to create the content to flesh them out. Good sequences and scenes but sadly are not too memorable. If you enjoyed the formula for Final Fantasy games before this then you will probably find XI to be a decent addition to the collection. For someone who's never played the older Final Fantasy games, by all means, jump in.   Played at the highest resoultion without problems - although certain videos would stutter during playback. Did not crash or run into any glitches that made the game unplayable. Be careful not to accidentally activate the game boosters (like opening every battle in trance mode).  Recommended for nostalgia and for being a decent game for its time. A story about life."
"This is possibly my favorite Final Fantasy or all time, coming back to it after so many years away has been an absolute pleasure. It is like coming home to reconnect with old friends that you haven't seen in fifteen years, and discovering that they are just as you remember.  This game is from when Square was a true master of character driven story telling, each character is memorable, has there own personality, there own motivations, and there own backstory. Even fifteen years after beating this game on the PS1 I still could name and describe each character, and remembered certain powerful and funny scenes.  Gameplay is also very well done, this is where Square had basically perfected the ATB system. Not as difficult as some of the earlier FF games, but could be challenging if you didn't prepare properly. Each character has there own battle role as well as strengths and weaknesses. How you set up your gear and junction stones can make a huge difference in how battles played out, even in the normal trash fights. Unless you came in way over leveled, or course.  Grapically I have to say that Square did a pretty good job porting this one over. The characters look nice and crisp, the backgrounds have been cleaned up somewhat (atleast the best they can without the original artwork to work with), and the menu is OK. (more on this in my complaints)   Sound is merely OK, I used my headphones the entire playthrough and I didn't hear any glitches, pops or other issues. I wish they had used a higher bitrate for the music files, but atleast it's not MIDI like 7 originally was. (Running Sennheiser HD 408's, old but still a very good set of headphones.)  No issues with stability, in my entire 90 hour playthrough I think I had one crash, and I think that was my comp throwing a fit.  Now for my complaints. The biggest gripe I have is with the UI, it is far bigger then it has any need to be. You can tell that this was ported over from mobile and designed for touch screen. When in battle the command window completely blocks your view of one of your characters, making it impossible to see them. The UI should have been scaled down at least 50% before release, or they should have given use the original UI just cleaned up. The original was just the right size where you could play this game on the couch and easily see what you were doing.  I had the ocasional frame dips, nothing major and I suspect it had more to do with playing in windowed mode. Speaking of which, would a borderless window have been that difficult to give us Square? Really?  I know that a lot of people have been complaining about the framerate cap, and I can kinda agree with them. 60fps would have been great, but I think it may have been a limit of the game engine more than anything. Don't forget that this is a port of an old PS1 game, they may have tied the framerate to the game clock in order to adjust for the limitations of the hardware. Trying to change that may have caused more issues then it was worth. Unfortunate but at least it isn't as crucial in a slow paced RPG as it is in a shooter, action, racing or other fast paced game.  The lack of wide screen is also kind of a wash for me. This game was released before 16:9 was really a thing, we didn't start seeing wide screen becoming popular until late in the PS2's life and even that system barely supported it. I would rather play in the old 4:3 ratio than have the game stretched and the characters looking squashed. I can't stand watching or playing anything when when the image has been stretched like that. Bugs the hell out of me.  So, overall I would have to say that this is a fantastic game and a merely OK port. I am still very happy to have played this game again and would recommend this game to anyone who has a love for old school RPG's."
9/10
Amazing game. It was a joy to replay it and I'm glad SE is giving great attention to the classics.
Only port that beats this is FFX-X2
"Great game, great music, classic FF battle system. Story rich, as is all the FF series and such a great game."
"Final Fantasy IX really takes me back. This remasted edition for the PC is great. I've played all the way through and every part played flawlessly. Awesome game, Awesome Remaster."
"Final Fantasy IX remake for PC is a wonderful experience for new and returning players! The new character graphics for the remake even make Queen Brahne look hot! But Seriously the character graphics add more detail that could easily be missed if you played the original on the PS1. I recommend buying this if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy franchise and haven't experienced this adventure yet and want a great RPG experience. Or if you are a casual player that has heard of Final Fantasy IX but don't understand the gameplay mechanics of RPGs and are in it for the story then you can turn on the boosts to turn off Random encounters, hit 9999s, etc. It is a friend for the hardcore and the casual."
My jaw is dropping looking at how much better the graphics are now! Unbelieveable how well they did with this game. Really highly recommend this amazing RPG adventure!
"I haven't played this game since I was a young babby, so a lot of things I have forgotten about. I think this game has aged well, though the first 6 hours or so of the game are pretty slow (you can use the f1 cheat to increase the game speed though and it won't actually count the speed into the game timer) Overall I think it''s a 6.5/10, the story is pretty whacky, the battle system can be annoying at first, the characters aren't so likeable at first but they grew on me. For example, Steiner was a pathetic mess at first. Then he became a maaaaaan."
"My first time playing and beating FFIX. I loved the story and what else can I say, its Final Fantasy and they always make the best games(Old FF games). I beat FF7, FF8, and FF9 only when they were ported remastered on steam. Best games and Love them! FFX is always my favourite! 10/10. Thank You square-enix!"
"Classic Final Fantasy quality. Epic story, epic music, love and a great overall experience...worth every penny. Just get it already!"
"One of the best final fantasy! Great story, nice characters and good soundtracks!"
"Ten outta ten, 10/10 a 100 out of 100, best game. Best game."
"Even after 5 years of leaving the game alone, still by far my favorite game of all time. I love the characters, love the art, (especially updated character models and portraits), I never will tire of this game,"
"If you are a FF fan but haven't played this yet, do yourself a favor. I can't praise the writing of the dialogue, characters, and story enough. The soundtrack is legendary, the best in the series. The updated character models and enhancements of this edition are great too."
"Ahhhh sweet nostalga,  I managed to loose many weeks of my teenage life playing this game and it was time well spent! The steam port gives you everything you want from a remake - additinal acheievement challanges, HD graphics, savestates with the 'Continue' function and finally a chance to actually obtain the Excalibur II by speeding up everything in the game (except the timer).  The only negative is that I've been experiencing a fair few crashes with the game and were it not for the savestates they would become very tiring indeed."
"Perfect game, perfect port. Still one of the best Final Fantasy games to date. The feels are just as real now as they were when I was twelve.  Only complaint is that the Cloud Save (Steam Sync) would sometimes lag between my main computer and my computer in the bedroom to the point where I would have to transfer the cloud save using a USB stick, but I've dealt with worse hiccups."
This is easily my favorite game of all time. This is the second game i ever owned. I previously played this on the orginal PSone with all 4 of those disks and cannot tell you how many times i beat this game and yet I still want to play again and again and again. Everything about this game is a masterpiece.   I love collecting every trading card and collecting every piece of armor and weaponary.   Please just do yourself a favor and buy this game. Easily best money well spent.
"Great game, 3rd party controller supported, slightly better graphics, what more can you ask for? This is a good port and worth the money in my opinion. I had the game crash on me a couple times, but the auto save feature always kept my place right before the crash so it was never a big issue."
This game is great it looks so much better than the original with HD resolutions so glad it made it's way from the ps1 to pc. It has a very diffrent art style from the original ff titles you meet a lot of characters that look like animals i mean you play as a monkey man if you can get use to the world and characters your in for a blast.  Brings back the old gamplay from older ff titles.  You want to get the master thief it will make it a lot easier to steal things further in the game and also bandit abllity if not you have a very low chance of stealing rare items from bosses since the steal rate is quite low 5% i think on some rare items. There are some really cool looking weapons and spells the pc version shows how much detail is in the weapons because of the HD res. the mini games are quite fun cards and choccobo digging-treasure hunting the only side quests that's not that good just my thoughts though is the moogle ones dilvering mail and relaxing on every beach in the game but it's optional you don't have to do it. if you can get to the end of the game in 12 hours you will be rewarded with somthing awesome
"I see that many people who got this game have played it when it first came out on the PS1. I did not though, so this not just a port of a game for me but also a whole new game altogether. so please bear with me if i say something that might come out as obvious.  that asside, I think Final Fantasy IX is definitely a god game  the game looks nice in terms of graphics, or at least, as nice as it can be. the gameplay is simple but effective and the story is really interesting, it has a nice build-up to the main plot and the characters are likeable. The game is also a throwback fest to older final fantasy titles, and its nice to be able to spot all those references  that being said, the game, or at least, the port, is not without its faults  although i did say the game looks great, it can be a bit of a clash between the high-res character models and the low-res pre-rendered background. some sound effects are way louder than others, and its a little bit anoying when you can't have the option of just turning the SF volume down, only have it on or off.  in terms of plot, yes it has good pacing for the main plot, but it has the tendency to give some backstory to other characters to only then never touch at them ever again. it only gives development to certain characters, giving something lackluster to others or simply none at all (I'm looking at you Quina. though they are a comic relief char so maybe its ok?)  for gameplay, there's not much i could say against it. Yes it has some game breakers but so does every other final fantasy game.  overall, although not perfect (far from it actually) its certainly a fun game and i definitely recomennd it to anyone thinking of playing it."
"Was really surprised on how this port turned out. Game never crashed for me. I am running on a solid build. None the less, still happy this game turned out as good os the Original"
Brilliant version of the game i loved as a teenager Fantastic
Played this game as a kid and where jumping of joy when it was released on PC. Nostalgic!  Wonderful stroy and well developed characters.
It's a joy to play this game. The music is beautiful and gameplay so much fun.
"nostalgic music, everything exactly as i remember it. awesome rerendered icond and models too, only wished the backgrounds get redone. other than that, fantastic port!"
10/10   Huge part of my life.  Steam please give us ' The Legend of Dragoon' now
"A wonderful adaption of Final Fantasy 9 to PC  The game looks amazing with its high definition models complementing the relatable characters, and Gaia is still a surreal and medieval place to call home. Skill and equipment system is totally unique. Also, Uematsu's score is one of the best in the entire franchise.  Despite some minor bugs and easily available cheats, Final Fantasy 9 is a great fun like the original."
Best pick of the Final Fantasy franch
"One of the best of the Playstation Era. I think it holds up spectacularly, and for me at least, it has a nice 'warm blanket' feeling. A must play jrpg, and in my opinion, the last of the great Square rpg's."
"Best game ever. Bought it when it released in 1996 and have been looking forward to playing it via pc since they announced, couldn't have spent my money any better."
Not terribly ported like the rest.
"I'm really glad they brought this wonderful master piece to PC. Now, the nostalgia of my childhood relives once more."
"Port is interesting. It definitely needs work (fps mainly imo) and could have been much better on release (very annoying bug involving analog stick movement on a wired 360 pad), but I felt within the first few minutes of play that my purchase was a good one. I have loved this game since its original release and if you did as well I can't see any reason to not buy this version other than a desire to wait for a sale."
"An excellent port with all the right upgrades for new and old fans of FF9 or the entire franchise to pick up.   If you like FInal Fantasy or oldschool JRPG's in general, you really can't go wrong here.   Cons (Such as they are): Character sprites and numerous models have been updated, but there is not (as of the time of this writing) any high definition backgrounds. That said, this should prove to be no issue at all if you already love the game.  Additionally, if you want to use the cheats built into this version of FF9, you have to use the Function keys to toggle them. As of this writing, the port developers haven't made that overly clear or self explanatory and it can be a bit unobvious if you don't know what to push to toggle them and don't know exactly what you're looking for to tell if they're on or off.  Pros: Excellent PC port with some graphical and gameplay updates from the original version. Squaresoft was at the top of their game in the FF7/FF8/FF9 years, and FF9 is a worthy culmination of that era with a memorable cast of characters, an engaging and often heartwarming storyline as well as a great deal of potential challenge, secrets and an expansion on one of the most addictive collectible card based mini games I've ever encountered in an RPG."
"I very highly recommend this game! If you're new to the franchise like I was when this title originally released, IX is an excellent starting point!"
Forgot how hard this game is.  Been playing for over an hour. Three screens in. Can not beat jump rope.   Game over
10/10  this game was released 16 years ago just goes to show not everything ages as badly as Steven Tyler.
"I had never played this game, aside from watching a friend play when I was a little kid. He and a few others always told me this was their favorite FF, and I can truly see why after just 6 hours of playing. The dialogue is wonderful, the story intriguing, and the world feels alive and vibrant. Citizens bustling around towns and cities, which are all beautiful works of art themselves. Also something I like, is that in any other RPG with overworld airships or the like, you're always the only one flying around, but in FFIX the airspace is full of othe vessles traveling to and fro. I quite enjoy the ATB battle system.     This port also has some nice features Emulator players will recognize. You've got your Max Dammage Mod, and a Frame skip (fast Forard) mod that doesn't speed up the music like in a regular emulator, which is a great feature to me.     The only problem i have with the frame skip is if you have it activated and go into a cut scene, it will still be Fast Forward, so be carful with that. Speaking of the cut scenes, they look great in HD, once you get past the frames they were originaly rendered at.  So yeah, with just 6 hours in, I already love this game."
"Very good game and so glad to finally see it make its way to the PC.  A few things to note: - Quite a few people are noting some pretty bad issues with controller support, I personally can't speak on behalf of that because there is not one game I enjoy playing with a controller so I never do. I thought I would mention that though for the people looking to play this with one.  - Graphics. For me, I don't care too much about the graphics. This is an older FF title so in today's standards the original didn't look all that pretty and I didn't buy this newer port expecting it to be either. But I will say the HD retouches on the cinematics made me giddier than a schoolgirl.  With all that out of the way I did thoroughly enjoy playing this on the PC and am not regretting the purchase.  This one also has some cheats in it like Fast Forward, Trance mode always-on and a few others that I forgot what they do. I personally think playing with most of them would ruin the game and so I didn't. I did however use the Fast Forward function while trecking the map... One thing I've always hated about RPG's is when they make you go to one end of the map and then walk all the way back, if I wanted to do that I would have bought something with a title like 'Walking simulator 2016'. The Fast Forward function was a beautiful way to get rid of that"
"If you're looking to revisit FFIX, I highly recommend this version over emulation. This port includes a graphics upgrade and many quality-of-life improvements thrown in.   The character and enemy models look vastly improved, and overall the game looks great except for some especially low-resolution background art in a handful of areas (particularly in the beginning.) It feels like a different game.   I am playing entirely on the keyboard with no issues at all. The nice thing is If you're using a keyboard, the game will refer to the actual keypads instead of the controller's buttons.  For veterans, the nostalgia value is off the charts. I also recommend new players to give FFIX a try. For streamers, this game is a must.  Rally-ho!"
"I'm more of a FF8 kind of guy,  but I'll give this game 100 impressed nobles out of 100.  If they port Chrono Cross to PC, Queen Me would be impressed..."
"Still my favorite Final Fantasy game so far. It has the best characters out of the series and I love how the game actually went back to a fantasy style, unlike almost every main Final Fantasy Game from VII and after."
My favorite FF game and believe me when I say that this version looks amazing! Like it kicked my Vita's ♥♥♥. I own this game in every form and I have to say the price tag for this version is absolutely worth it! With the fast foward button you can finally get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Excalibur II without breaking your freaking PS1 to do it!   Fair Warning: I use an Xbox One remote to play and yes there are some glitches but to make sure it doesnt happen just plug it in after starting the game and you have like literally no problems. I
CLASIC
Finally a great PC port for a Final Fantasy game. Their best aside from the later released FFX/X-2 ports.
Extremely fun and nostalgic experience. The crossover works fine just as long as you know how to set up your keys right. I tried it with the Steam controller too and it works fine.
"This is a great game in the Final Fantasy series. For review of the game itself, there are many reviews and opinions out there.   One of the few FF games that can be completed to 98% without a walkthrough if you are dedicated.   PC port didn't break the performance on this game on a laptop with a 3 years old GPU."
"My all time favorite Final Fantasy game! The port is very well done with only a few annoying changes to the UI to gripe about being held over from the mobile port. The cleaned up models look great, and while the backgrounds can sometimes be pretty grainy its a small price to pay to play this masterpiece again.   Controller suport is pretty well implemented, wish you could change the button prompts from the PSX ones to be more universal with PC controllers, but its a small complaint.   If you have never played this game before you are in for a real treat. The highlights here are going to be the absolutely stellar soundtrack, the depth of the characters and the setting, and just a great sense of theatricality and fantasy that really makes the big moments shine. The plot when taken as a whole may not be the most coherent thing ever written (especially the 3rd act), but individual arcs and moments in the story some of the best in the genre. The progression system is pretty unique and very deep without feeling too complex.   Tips: save everything! you will need old weapons and armors to create powerful synthesis items later in the game, and some weapons will no longer be sold by vendors after certain plot points have been met, if you have the gill buy some extras to keep on hand for later especially with some of the early weapons (mythril swords, im looking at your).   The ability system in this game is odd at first, but basically it works like this: Items have passive and sometimes active abilities assigned to them that may be different depending on the character that has the item equiped. these abilities can be used while the item is equiped, and have a progress bar that fills up as you gain ap from monster battles. Once the bar is full, you learn the ability permanently. What this means is that sometimes even if an items stats are not optimal, its still worth a look, you may be able to gain a powerful ability from it to add to your collection by sacrificing some attack power or defense for a short time while you master the ability. Be sure the press the select button for tips as some itens grant immunities or added effects that do not appear in the regular info pane.  Steal from everything! Well maybe not everything, but any time zidane is in the party for a boss fight be sure to make use of his steal ability. Each boss carries three items that can be stolen, and they are often powerful items from later in the game, you can gain crazy heastarts on mastering abilities by utilizing this throughout the game. Be sure to do this in the opening fight as it rewards you a weapon for zidane that will be optimal for a good portion of the games opening.  that should be enough to get you started, have blast!"
"My family still owns a copy of Final Fantasy IX on Playstation, and I've spent more hours than I can count on it. The first disc doesn't work anymore due to damage (it won't load anything after the swordfight mini-game) but we have a save from an old game and so we still frequently play it. Without a doubt I can say that it's one of my all-time favorite titles. So when I saw that it was out on Steam, I got really excited. I pulled out all the stops, even downloaded Windows 10 onto my Macbook Air using Bootcamp (I was subject to much ridicule by my mom, who's an Apple purist, haha). Then I laid aside lots of free time, secluded myself from the rest of the world except work and family.   Conclusion, after a good playthrough? It was all totally worth it. I had so much fun. Thank you so much, and kudos, to the developers for keeping much of the original game's charm!! The gray patterned background, all those little sidequests, Tetra Master, the list goes on and on. I had been afraid that some things might be streamlined for newer audiences but to my delight, everything was there and accessible, just as I remembered. The updated HD character and monster sprites are WONDERFUL. I learned a few things I never had before, such as that a Fang is actually a wolf and not a rabbit?? Haha. Also the cinematics are as stunning as ever. My personal favorite is the one with Vivi on the cargo ship, near the very beginning, still Disc 1 I believe. Last, but not least, every part of the story is still there, truly a gripping work of art that once was the cornerstone of the Final Fantasy games.  I'm a little bit of a FF purist (Kingdom Hearts doesn't cut it for me, it seems all wrong :/) so sorry, heh.  I only have two criticisms, and they are very tiny, really. First of all, being able to use a Playstation controller would totally rock--that's how I'm used to playing it. But it really doesn't affect anything too much, and oh well what can I do. Second of all, I'm sort of disappointed that the pretty font from the original game wasn't kept--you know, the one on the menus and battle screens. It was more display than sans serif, with the old-style hooks and flourishes. I know that it's a little archaic and outdated, not to mention hard to read at times, but I think it would have added a bit more authenticity.   Again, thanks so much to Steam and Square Enix for doing this!! You have in me a happy and fulfilled customer. (( 9.5 / 10 ))"
"This game is one of my childhood Greats, its the main reason I called myself 'Tantalusdan'. I love the fact they have brought it to steam, but slightly disapointed at the same time. Characters look great but the backgrounds are crap and I hate the fact its not been stretched to give it a full 1080p experience. But other than that, I'm loving it and would recommend it to other people who love FFIX"
"a classic example of the final fantasy franchise with a strong but easily understandable story supported by fun but very human characters. also includes an addicting and rage-inducing trading card mini-game.  be warned, this is a port, NOT A REMASTER. that said, the graphics will impress no one at this day and age, and will take some getting used to. if ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics are a problem for you, i'd recommended that you buy this game on a tablet.  but this game will always look beautiful to me ;______;"
"I played this game when it was originally released in 1999, i loved it then as i love it now, these PSX era Final Fantasies were awesome and a vital part of gaming at the time. this game feels to have aged better than FF7 or 8 and as such i recommend anyone who likes JRPGs play this regardless of weather they played the original, this is simply an amazing game"
"It's FF IX. If you know it you know what your in for. If not why not try it. The character models are improved however the backgrounds in places are very pixel low res as they seem to be the unaltered originals. Thats fine as they only said they improved the characters but if you run FF IX on an emu then the backhrounds look nicer and your get nice char models as well so whatveer works for you. If possible, avoid windowed mode. If anything pops a notification the game minimises or moves to the background so its a pain in the ♥♥♥. If you can go fullscreen. pff @ 2560 x 1080 it supports it but you have the good ol textured bars at the side. Aspect ratio is not altered so another + for emu is that it will go into full 2560 x 1080 whereas this will not. Maybe it's me but it seems like the dialogue is altered in places. However the i am using English (UK) instead of (US) so who knows. Yeah it's FF IX. They haven't broke it :p"
"It's FF9 with high res toon models, less pixelated backgrounds, and some qol improvements. If this the first time playing through this game by all means enjoy the qol stuff, or don't it'll suck most of the fun out of the game."
I remember the good old days from playing this game. Worth it!
OMG!!!  It feels like i'm still dreaming. The best final fantasy that i loved to play countless times during my childhood is now here on pc.   Thank you so much Square Enix :)
I LOVE FFIX!!!!!! I decided to purchase this because its an a amazing game and I really wanted to show SQUARE ENIX that I am ready and willing to buy FFIX annnnnnd FFX !!!!!!! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RELEASE FINAL FANTASY 10/10-2 HD REMASTER!!!!!!!! I WILL BUY IT ON THE FIRST DAY! I am REALLY excited to see what other Square games are released on the PC!
"Well trully very very thank you to Square Enix and Steam to release this game on PC For me, this is the third best story of Final Fantasy (for me the best on is VII, then X), its very nostalgic to play this game cause I played it once with my old brother in PS1. The picture also smooth, so Iam very enjoy the game, even it is the old game.  I very recommend to you to play this FF IX if you want to nostalgia from the PS1 P.S I love Vivi and Garnet who always can support the other in the game :D, and Zidane who can steal everything, they are very very my lovely character"
"100% will be playing when i can use a controller. The graphics look great. love having it on my pc so i dont have to hook up the old ps1 or emulate. Controller with DS4 windows, Xbox 360 controller, neither work. Will put thumbs up, just because thumbs down makes ppl unhappy... its still a great game! just dying to play, but refuse to use M/keyboard for nostalgic reasons.  tldr; 9/10 until controller support fix comes out ;) then, 10/10"
"Solid port of one my favorite Final Fantasy games. While i like FFVII and the non fantasy vibe in VIII, X, X-2 etc. I really loved that IX was more classical fantasy to it. The battle system is good, the characters are great and you feel invested. I am so glad that this finally got ported to PC. Now back to it!"
"Final Fantasy IX on pc.. been waiting forever..was it worth the wait?  Yes, the game looks good ( as much as it can ) compared to the old PS version and so far i have yet run into any bugs.  Many hours of good old FF fun."
"Finished my first playthrough of this game after a couple other FF games, and I think I have a new favorite! Nothing else to say, really, except that it would be complete if someone were to mod in Beatrix as a full-time party member."
Still a classic! Def need to change that combat UI though. WAYYYYYYYYYYYY to big! Its ok then theres only 1 or 2 party members but when theres 4 it takes up neary 1/4 or your screen. other than that I love this game
Very good port. Enhanced CG and texture made this game look great even 16 years have passed. I hope they did this to FF7 and 8 but it seem too late lol
"The remake looks great, has nice customization for PCs and brings some new features for new players. I would totally recommend buying it, because it's the best version of an already great game you can get."
Best version of this great game. Battles start quicker. Also commands are being executed instantly and you don't have to wait awkwardly long times.  The texture update is really good!
"FFIX 10/10  PC Port 7/10 (no Remaster) Overall 9/10  It holds up today magnifically, best JRPG ever made the port has some gameplay improvements (autosaving, less battle encounters, being able to use boosters gameplay-wise it's a 9/10 port but they could have spent some time remaking the backgrounds to make them less blurry, you can still download third party programs that help get a better experience graphically, still.  If you have never played this game you are missing out and now there are no more excuses :)"
"This game is just as amazing as I remember on playstation. It works great with keyboard mouse ( I was able to impress 100% of the people and the queen) and it works great with controller.   I was very worried that this port would be garbage but square really came through on this one, a must buy if you are a FF fan."
"An excellent port of a classic PSX game.  The Thai team that revamped this game did a phenominal job of making it native to the PC. Not only does the port run incredibly smoothly and without glitches that I've found, it also looks incredibly crisp with the graphic filters they used.  All character portraits have been redone into HD versions in the menu (no more looking at Freya on the menu and trying to figure out WTF she looks like.)  Even in battle you can tell when the numbers come off the enemy during an attack sequence that they've been redone and re-animated. All fonts are clear and easily legible in high resolutions, all menus look great. Honestly, if you haven't played this or in my case if you really really wanted to beat it 10 years ago and never got around to it: this is by far the best way to play it. It blows any other final fantasy port out of the water thus far (not counting the recently released FF-X/X2.) If you played FF7 and FF8 re-releases on PC, this is significantly less half-♥♥♥♥♥. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.  Otherwise the story is decent, this FF has more of a 'kiddie' or light-hearted feel to it, but it's not entirely juvenile. Some facets are cool, but have modest gains. Most notably the Tetra Master card game; while not as punishing as FF8's triple triad, is considerably more lackluster. The cards are there for nothing other than collection value, whereas in FF8 you could use them for refining spells to add to your arsenal."
"Firstly it's an absolute classic and an excellent game. You can see how much care and attention went into each section of the game and there's so many little extras thrown in all over the place! Second the port is fantastic with endless save slots, fully functioning and intergrated controller support, fully re-programmeable keyboard controls, and even max lvl/gil/abilties for fun if you're into trying some cra\y fun of the game! "
Great port of an amazing game!
awesomely good port. if you played this back on the ps1 than your in for a treat. because what little changes they did make it better  locked at 30fps yes but i find its very smoth for 30fps so thats not a problem
"This game is still worth every cent. Played it as a child, playing it as a grownup and it is simply awesome!!!  Love it! No bugs so far. No huge visual enhances either but i think the game was and is beautiful as it is. Definitely recommend 10/10 would play again.  Here a bit of gameplay if you wanna take a look :)          YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;"
"Very good port of a very good (if not one of the best) installment(s) of the 'Final Fantasy' series.   As with every other Playstation (or in this case iOS) Final Fantasy port, the prerendered backgrounds are kind of blurry, the game's stuck in 4:3 mode and we don't get anything above 30 fps at all, but these are just minor annoyances due to the fact that FF IX OOZES charme.  The game takes some time to unfold and won't throw you in a pit of constant action and explosions, but instead tries to drag you into the mindset of charming, well-defined characters, thrown together into a story that is kind of stereotypical, but well told and interesting till the very end.  Oh and, when you happen to make 9999 damage with each slash all of a sudden, try pressing F3: for some reason the devs thought a built-in cheat mode would do the game good.  Still, heavily recommended. FF IX is a master piece well worth your time."
Love the HD cinematics! Miss this game so much! Gonna beat this game again on steam even though I still have a copy of FF9 on my PS1! :D I also miss the moogles lol
Still a better love story than twilight.
I pressed start... oh hell yea!
"Everything you know and love about FF9 but so much more in terms of looks. Gameplay has more options this time around. If you want to just sit back with the easy mode auto battle and max damage for the sake of enjoying the story. Or use the speed up enhancement for the little things that get on your nerves. That speed comes in handy, be it grinding or slow dialogue heavy moments that stuck with you in memory since the PS1 days. As a side note that T rating for partial nudity did not make sense in low-res PS1 graphics but seeing it again now...it makes a difference."
"First off I've only just made it Lindblum, my first playthrough I'm taking slow and lax. I've not had ANY issues controller wise, I've used a USB SNES Controller and generic wired Xbox 360 Controller.  My only complaint so far is the size of the hud in battle, a bit MUCH too large.  FPS has been smooth so far, I've noticed some speech edits, specifically the little girl in Alexandria saying 'Dropped' instead of 'Dwopped', which isn't too big but it gave that childish feel in the original.  All in all, I've had a great experience myself and I'm just GLAD it finally made it's way to STEAM."
"Fun story, fun characters and good mechanics. A classic of the JRPG genre that I have loved since the day it came out. The remastered models look quite good and the cut-scenes are gorgeous as always, though that may be my nostalgia talking."
"'This IS a classic and im So happy it was brought to Steam'  There is not much i can say about this Game that you Don't already know  Regaedless if you played it on PS1/PSX or the Emulated version on PS3  However i will say this i do advise against useing the Speed boost as it has a habbit of breaking battles, can be handy if manged properly .. again the other boosts could ruin the Gameplay if this is your first time playing FF IX  if not and you know the story, boost come in handy getting over the mundane leveling issues with the game and Speed running the Game.  Is the game enjoyable? in my opinon Yes i find This one in my top 5 Playstaion final fantasys"
"This is the original game with character model improvements and some new options. 3rd favorite FF, waiting patiently for ffX for PC............"
Absolutely amazing game even better on steam with upscaled character models.
This is a brilliant game - no less predicted from the Final Fantasy series. I got to admit that I'm a fan and that might color my review quite much. This game works surprising well with the Steam link and the controller.
"Tried to play this game on and off for the last decade but eventually finished it on pc.  This game is amazing, great story and characters and an interesting abilities level up system, an it looks great in hd.  Only problem i had with it was the aspect ratio, it cut a third of my screen with no stretch image option. other than that this is a great port. well worth the price"
This game was what started my love of jrpg's. If anyone has a love of a good story this is your game to play for 50 hours on your first playthrough..-cough- (could also turn on cheats and just ignore the monsters and focus on the story alone but who wants that when the gameplay is actually fun?) Also fantastic controller support...(except flying ships/boats..they kinda dropped the ball and made it complicated) -used xbox controller and all button prompts came up right
"Absolute masterpiece of a game as good today as it was when it first came out, Story and soundtrack are amazing and make this must play to anyone who has or has never tried it before, if youre a fan of final fantasy and have not played this get it played as soon as possible you wont be disapointed."
"I love this game I really do, so I bought it excited to replay one of my favorites.  For some reason the game will not load and closes itself after intro titles.  Running on admin, tried both 64/86, everything up to date.  So I refunded and bought FFX/X-2 and can run it on high graphics no issues.  I'm really not sure what was up with the FFIX port, but please fix it so I can add it to the collection.  Lots of people seem to be able to run it, if you can then its an amazing game and worth every penny.  Thanks,  A Severely Concerned Addict"
"Just a stunning game, its one of those few games where, when you finish the game and the end 'story' unveils you become happy. Usually I become a little sad when finishing a game, as the ending is not what I hoped for, but Final Fantasy IX really has a great ending."
"Let me just start by saying, this game is nowhere near as buggy as people seem to think it is. Put a good amount of hours in already since it's my favorite FF game in the series. What people fail to realize is, it's not just the games fault, but also people's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hardware. It's a great port and a great game for those of us wanting to go back and play it again or even for newcomers. The shakesperian theme of the entire game is fantastic to say the least, and the chocobo mini game is the best mini game (in my opinion) of the series.   tl;dr Buy this game if you want to sink countless hours into a masterpiece and your computer wasn't made in 1995."
"The best Final Fantasy in the series! Apart from the 4:3 aspect ratio and slightly low res textures- It's a perfect port of the original. It's not 60FPS, but still plays like butter.           YouTube™ Video:  Final Fantasy IX is finally on PC!&nbsp;"
"Well, they are back.  Needless to say that this is just as fun as it was, with some enhancement on characters visuals (the rest is just as it was, not expecting a remake which is completely another matter) and small tweaks here and there.  On the whole, everything just work fine, we even have autosave, which also saves time whenever you want to try something else.   FF IX might be the FF game I most liked to play to date, because it mainly has everything a RPG needs: compelling story, great characters, funny moments, sad moments, fury moments, engaging battles (nothing is too easy), funny ability system tied with equipments, all signature abilities there, signature characters, names, magical ambiance, chocobos, mini-games - in short, the game that gets immersive and carry you with it.  Get ready to hunt for every single detail and secret in this awesome piece of art, often underrated, and enjoy the fun (but the male villain could have a less bizarre outfit)."
"Awesome port, love the new HD character models."
"Great port. The 3d models are very impressive and FMVs are way nicer. Some folks are complaining about the big UI and sound, which is understandable. Personally, I love the Big UI cause I can read it nicely playing on a projector."
The music...the story...the nostalgia...worth playing it again just for that.
"It's a well done port. The UI, controls, etc. are solid for keyboard. The game itself is solid if you like JRPGs. The only downside to the game is the fact that it seems locked to around 30 fps but usually runs around 20-24 on the overworld."
Pros: + Great Soundtrack + Gameplay is smooth everywhere in the game... + The story is amazing + Characters are all lovable + Freyja is my waifu now + Challenging battles with a large skill mechanic  Cons: - ... and not in the overworld in which the fps tends to be decreasing (but still playable). - It can be pretty difficult at the beginning (but it's not really a con it's juste me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥)    10/10
"Finally... My favorite Final Fantasy is now on PC.   Its everything i have ever dreamed of.  When i got the email saying it was out i was hanging out with my friends (it was almost 1am at this time) I jumped up, and told my friend to drive me home... NOW. Everyone was so confused. They havent seen me since. 10/10 no regrets."
"Game runs great so far All time favourite final fantasy storyline.   Character detail looks nice and WAY better than any emulator so far that i have personally used.  Backgrounds look smoother,much easier on the eyes.   *Found a floating glass in an alexandria bar* ...guessing missing character?"
"Great RPG, one of the best in the series."
It's solid. This'll be what I use for a big FFIX stream I've wanted to give all my friends for years now but never got around to.  It's wonderful.  FFIX has always been my favourite.
This old but gold :) i looked this game when still a little girl but this game is very rare  but now i had this and i can continue what i leave before
"Awesome port, love the new HD character models."
I played this game when it came out and it was just amazing but you know how it is after so many years you play it again and it's not as good as you remember well not with this game it's fantastic much better than i remember graphics never looked this good and soundtrack is superb it holds up very well to this day.
"one of the best RPG's ever created - hands down. Beautiful story with deep, interesting characters. This steam remake doesnt dissapoint either. Theyve cleanded up the graphics and made some of the menu screens a bit cleaner as well. Buy this game."

It's prolly my favorite FF game
great game great combat system great story but minigames are dull and boring
It's awesome but of course it's awesome. It always was awesome. And I waited so long for it to be finally released for pc/steam to play it for the 37365736 time!!!! :D 
"IX &gt; VIII  Final Fantasy IX is often regarded as a classic, and after playing it all the way through, it's easy to see why. With a fun cast of characters, amazing music, and some old school charm, this is a game that is definitely worth playing. Only problem with this game is really how the otherwise great plot goes a bit bonkers towards the end of the game (with a final boss that comes out of nowhere and is never spoken of before or after his appearance! The hell, Necron?!?). This is an example of Final Fantasy at its best."
"This is a great game in the Final Fantasy series. For review of the game itself, there are many reviews and opinions out there.   One of the few FF games that can be completed to 98% without a walkthrough if you are dedicated.   PC port didn't break the performance on this game on a laptop with a 3 years old GPU."
"My all time favorite Final Fantasy game! The port is very well done with only a few annoying changes to the UI to gripe about being held over from the mobile port. The cleaned up models look great, and while the backgrounds can sometimes be pretty grainy its a small price to pay to play this masterpiece again.   Controller suport is pretty well implemented, wish you could change the button prompts from the PSX ones to be more universal with PC controllers, but its a small complaint.   If you have never played this game before you are in for a real treat. The highlights here are going to be the absolutely stellar soundtrack, the depth of the characters and the setting, and just a great sense of theatricality and fantasy that really makes the big moments shine. The plot when taken as a whole may not be the most coherent thing ever written (especially the 3rd act), but individual arcs and moments in the story some of the best in the genre. The progression system is pretty unique and very deep without feeling too complex.   Tips: save everything! you will need old weapons and armors to create powerful synthesis items later in the game, and some weapons will no longer be sold by vendors after certain plot points have been met, if you have the gill buy some extras to keep on hand for later especially with some of the early weapons (mythril swords, im looking at your).   The ability system in this game is odd at first, but basically it works like this: Items have passive and sometimes active abilities assigned to them that may be different depending on the character that has the item equiped. these abilities can be used while the item is equiped, and have a progress bar that fills up as you gain ap from monster battles. Once the bar is full, you learn the ability permanently. What this means is that sometimes even if an items stats are not optimal, its still worth a look, you may be able to gain a powerful ability from it to add to your collection by sacrificing some attack power or defense for a short time while you master the ability. Be sure the press the select button for tips as some itens grant immunities or added effects that do not appear in the regular info pane.  Steal from everything! Well maybe not everything, but any time zidane is in the party for a boss fight be sure to make use of his steal ability. Each boss carries three items that can be stolen, and they are often powerful items from later in the game, you can gain crazy heastarts on mastering abilities by utilizing this throughout the game. Be sure to do this in the opening fight as it rewards you a weapon for zidane that will be optimal for a good portion of the games opening.  that should be enough to get you started, have blast!"
"This game is one of my childhood Greats, its the main reason I called myself 'Tantalusdan'. I love the fact they have brought it to steam, but slightly disapointed at the same time. Characters look great but the backgrounds are crap and I hate the fact its not been stretched to give it a full 1080p experience. But other than that, I'm loving it and would recommend it to other people who love FFIX"
"a classic example of the final fantasy franchise with a strong but easily understandable story supported by fun but very human characters. also includes an addicting and rage-inducing trading card mini-game.  be warned, this is a port, NOT A REMASTER. that said, the graphics will impress no one at this day and age, and will take some getting used to. if ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics are a problem for you, i'd recommended that you buy this game on a tablet.  but this game will always look beautiful to me ;______;"
"I played this game when it was originally released in 1999, i loved it then as i love it now, these PSX era Final Fantasies were awesome and a vital part of gaming at the time. this game feels to have aged better than FF7 or 8 and as such i recommend anyone who likes JRPGs play this regardless of weather they played the original, this is simply an amazing game"
"I first played this game when it was initially released on PS1, about 15 years ago, and although I really enjoyed it then, I got stuck at a boss on the final disc which ultimately put me off and I never picked it up again. When this appeared on Steam, I saw this as an opportunity to finish what I had started all those years ago. The port itself is very good, no performance issues unlike some of the other more recent FF ports, and the updated character models look fantastic compared to their classic counterparts. Besides that, everything appears to be exactly the same as the PS1 classic, which is no bad thing. The soundtrack has always been one of the best in the series, the story is kept intriguing with small twists throughout, and the battle system is probably my favourite of the series with the exception of FFX’s pure turn-based system. Optional side missions are plentiful, but the difficulty scaling of the main story is such that you are able to beat the final boss with fairly minimal grinding and no side missions is desired. This is definitely one of the best from the ‘golden age’ of FF games, and is absolutely worth picking up if you’re a fan of other JRPG’s of this era. Probably my second favourite FF game behind VII."
Forgot how hard this game is.  Been playing for over an hour. Three screens in. Can not beat jump rope.   Game over
10/10  this game was released 16 years ago just goes to show not everything ages as badly as Steven Tyler.
"Excellent port, only complaint is the sound/sfx volume cant be adjusted incrementally like ff7, i usually like having other audio .. radio shows etc in the background while playing these games. other then that, what more positive things can i say concerning FF that you dont already know."
"FFVII has long been my favourite game of all time ever since I played it back in the 90s. I also enjoyed VIII and X (but somehow missed ever playing IX), but I think I enjoyed this more than any of them. It's just a fantastic game, they really don't make them like this anymore  First the port is pretty good. The 3D models (especially those of the main characters) look a lot better than the originals and the spell effects it seems have also got a makeover and look very nice. The 2D backgrounds however are the original low-res textures which look fairly ugly to be frank (although they been smoothed and filtered), especially at first. But you do quickly get used to them. The menus and dialogs have gone HD, as have the character icons, the Tetra Master card game etc. The cutscenes have also got a makeover and look pretty good. I've encountered no technical problems.  Secondly, the game. It's just fantastic. Magical. This is what RPG gaming should be like. Compared to the previous 2 titles, IX has gone with a more medieval/steampunk vibe which I love.  What makes this game truly great are the characters which are the best bunch of any video game I've played. The writing is just superb. You really really care about each of them. Then you have music from Nobuo Uematsu, which is possibly my favourite of all the FF games. The story isn't quite at convoluted and complicated as VII and VIII and probably better for it. There is a lot of humour and light heartedness in the game, but it gradually develops into weighty themes about love, life and death, and the central guiding message is about the importance of friendship. We also have the most organic and 'real' romance of any FF game, and the most wonderful ending.  With a good PC port and 10/10 game, this is a must buy if you haven't played it before."
"Final Fantasy IX is awesome , and I can't give a non-biased review free of nostalgia no matter how hard I tried, so instead I'll focus on the port rather than the game itself. Overall, I believe this to be the definitive version despite a few nitpicks.  While not a HD remaster, the graphics have been greatly improved. The main character models have been redone and look fantastic, the UI is sharp and the prerendered backgrounds have received a bit of TLC too, though they haven't been redrawn. Some look a little dated - a notable example is the main square of Alexandria. All in all, the improved graphics allowed me to enjoy the game on my HD monitor without reminding me that I'm playing a 16 year old game.  Unfortunatley, the command menu during battles is carried over from the mobile version rather than the PSX version and thereby takes up more screen space and feels cumbersome to navigate. While the option to use the PSX command menu would have been nice, I did get used to this version quickly and found it had no functional impact on battles as it can be hidden at any time.   There have been more beneficial changes to battles as well. The original’s battles took their time to load, much longer than the previous FFs on PSX. After loading, the camera panned around the battlefield for a while before you could take control of your characters. The steam version’s load times are thankfully much shorter and the option of skipping the camera panning is there, saving you a great deal of time over the course of the game.   Other features included with the intention of saving time are the speed up and no encounters boosters, which I abused frequently. The former helps you navigate the large locations of the game quickly or cheat at the Chocobo Hot and Cold mini-game, which I heartily suggest you do. I found skipping random encounters most useful when exploring the world map or back tracking, but it can also be handy for keeping the party's level low or skipping to story segments without interruptions. These features give you more control of how you spend your time in-game and the whole experience is better for them.   The issues I’ve highlighted weren’t impactful enough to be real concerns, whilst the new features and graphical improvements really helped me delve into this classic again. Props go to Silicon Studio for an excellent port, and here’s hoping for a fully realized HD remake one day."
"OK a quick review.  I know you can emulate this game and yet this is really far more than emulators can do if you don't have a beefy rig, the smoothness, many resolutions to pick on, solid rendering, the list goes on and of course to support an official release.  The good thing I know for real is there's a ton of achievements you can collect almost up to 90 objects for just an old game from 16 years ago and this really suits my style of playing games.  ps STILL WAITING FOR FFXII HD Remastered, COME ON, Square Enix!! literally can't wait!"
"Let me start off by saying that FFIX was my first Final Fantasy game and because of that it became my favorite so it's difficult for me to be unbiased in my review. For the sake of this I will focus on this title's validity as a PC port. PC gamers may see the framerate which is regulated to 15 fps in-game and 30 fps in FMVs as a negative for this title but being as this is a Playstation-era game with pre-rendered backgrounds the framerate doesn't hinder gameplay. I was completely oblivious to the framerate throughout my entire playthrough and if it hadn't been for the FPS counter in Steam I would have never questioned it. In-game character models are updated to show more detail and to be less jagged around the edges but still keep that familiar PSOne look. The best way I can think to describe their look is to think N64 character models which to me always looked more solid than their PS counterparts. The boosters are the biggest change to this version. There are numerous boosters that affect gameplay drastically with a few being located in the 'config' menu that cannot be turned off once they are turned on in a single playthrough. The less game breaking and to me ultimately more useful boosters can be found by pausing the game and using the shoulder buttons (assuming you are playing with a controller). These boosters can give you full MP and automatically put your characters into Trance, make you deal max damage (9,999), turn off random encounters, or speed up the gameplay. These last two I recommend for anyone who wants to do a 'pure/cheat-free' run but is hindered on time. One flaw I did not notice back in my childhood that became painfully obvious while playing this port was that the game suffers from horribly slow battle time. Here is where the game speed booster came in handy as I would use it for level and ability grinding but turn it off during boss encounters. I can't recommend using this booster outside of battle because you character can quickly jump across the screen and it can be easy to lose track of them, anyone who has fiddled with emulators will be familiar with this. The no random-encounter feature is a godsend for end-game when you are maxed out already or when you just desperately want to leave an area as the encounter-rate in the game is fairly high. The story remains faithful to the original with the same translation as before and outside of boosters the gameplay is untweaked from the original.  The only cons I can think of would be that the pre-rendered backgrounds didn't receive the same enhanced treatment that the character models and uncompressed FMV sequences did. I understand that some pre-rendered backgrounds move and that the original uncompressed files could have been lost but it would have been nice if the game had looked polished in its entirety rather than just partially. Still this is a small nitpick that doesn't detract from my recommendation of this game. The Continue feature also seemed to be unreliable as I would sometimes receive a Game Over if I wasn't too careful during grinding sessions and be forced to rely on an old Save instead of the Continue feature. I quickly learned to frequently save though so this feature became a non-issue for me. Due to its sporatic nature I wouldn't recommend using it and to instead stick to the tried and true Save/Load option. In short:  Pros: -Optional boosters can remove tedium for those looking to just enjoy the story or those with less time than others -Enhanced character models breath new life into the visuals -Uncompressed FMVs let us see how they were meant to be seen.  Cons: -Some boosters cannot be turned off so if you save and decide later to revert you need to restart. Thankfully these particular boosters are not mapped to shoulder buttons and are had to accidentally turn on. -Pre-rendered backgrounds still look muddy and the muddiness is only accentuated by the clean visuals of the character models and FMV sequences. -Continue feature is unreliable and generally sporatic in terms of where you pick back up. If you are level grinding against difficult enemies (say Grand Dragons) and are afraid you may get a Game Over I recommend relying on the Save and Load features instead.  Neutral: -Framerate lock may or may not disappoint some but doesn't take away from the visuals or gameplay in any way. Personally, I couldn't even tell."
"I had never played this game, aside from watching a friend play when I was a little kid. He and a few others always told me this was their favorite FF, and I can truly see why after just 6 hours of playing. The dialogue is wonderful, the story intriguing, and the world feels alive and vibrant. Citizens bustling around towns and cities, which are all beautiful works of art themselves. Also something I like, is that in any other RPG with overworld airships or the like, you're always the only one flying around, but in FFIX the airspace is full of othe vessles traveling to and fro. I quite enjoy the ATB battle system.     This port also has some nice features Emulator players will recognize. You've got your Max Dammage Mod, and a Frame skip (fast Forard) mod that doesn't speed up the music like in a regular emulator, which is a great feature to me.     The only problem i have with the frame skip is if you have it activated and go into a cut scene, it will still be Fast Forward, so be carful with that. Speaking of the cut scenes, they look great in HD, once you get past the frames they were originaly rendered at.  So yeah, with just 6 hours in, I already love this game."
"Very good game and so glad to finally see it make its way to the PC.  A few things to note: - Quite a few people are noting some pretty bad issues with controller support, I personally can't speak on behalf of that because there is not one game I enjoy playing with a controller so I never do. I thought I would mention that though for the people looking to play this with one.  - Graphics. For me, I don't care too much about the graphics. This is an older FF title so in today's standards the original didn't look all that pretty and I didn't buy this newer port expecting it to be either. But I will say the HD retouches on the cinematics made me giddier than a schoolgirl.  With all that out of the way I did thoroughly enjoy playing this on the PC and am not regretting the purchase.  This one also has some cheats in it like Fast Forward, Trance mode always-on and a few others that I forgot what they do. I personally think playing with most of them would ruin the game and so I didn't. I did however use the Fast Forward function while trecking the map... One thing I've always hated about RPG's is when they make you go to one end of the map and then walk all the way back, if I wanted to do that I would have bought something with a title like 'Walking simulator 2016'. The Fast Forward function was a beautiful way to get rid of that"
"I'm more of a FF8 kind of guy,  but I'll give this game 100 impressed nobles out of 100.  If they port Chrono Cross to PC, Queen Me would be impressed..."
ff9 is amazing im just started the card game to boost my card level up the secret bosses last weapons all you would expect from a fianl fantasy game less talking more playing
"Best game in final fantasy franchise, love story of this game , Would Definately Recommend. A++"
My favorite FF game and believe me when I say that this version looks amazing! Like it kicked my Vita's ♥♥♥. I own this game in every form and I have to say the price tag for this version is absolutely worth it! With the fast foward button you can finally get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Excalibur II without breaking your freaking PS1 to do it!   Fair Warning: I use an Xbox One remote to play and yes there are some glitches but to make sure it doesnt happen just plug it in after starting the game and you have like literally no problems. I
"If you're looking to revisit FFIX, I highly recommend this version over emulation. This port includes a graphics upgrade and many quality-of-life improvements thrown in.   The character and enemy models look vastly improved, and overall the game looks great except for some especially low-resolution background art in a handful of areas (particularly in the beginning.) It feels like a different game.   I am playing entirely on the keyboard with no issues at all. The nice thing is If you're using a keyboard, the game will refer to the actual keypads instead of the controller's buttons.  For veterans, the nostalgia value is off the charts. I also recommend new players to give FFIX a try. For streamers, this game is a must.  Rally-ho!"
"A rather good port of a PS1 classic. It feels good to be able to be able to play this without needing to swap disks. While the 'game boosters' are for the most part cheat buttons, the added autosave function feels like a feature that belongs in an RPG where save points can be far apart with boss fights seperating them. The graphical enhancements are noticable, but aren't jarring or out of place like in some other Final Fantasy PC ports.  I did have trouble getting my xbox360 controller working as apparently every one of my buttons is bound to down on the d-pad for some reason, however it seems this is an isolated incident and the keyboard controls aren't pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, which is a good sign for any port."
"Hands-down my favourite Final Fantasy game of all time. The soundtrack, the characters and the optimization of the steam-release are truly up to snuff. I highly reccomend this game to anyone. Even for those who haven't played a JRPG before, this is fairly entry-tier in my opinion (Atleast compared to FF8, yikes).   I didn't have any trouble playing through this game, no crashes etc. Ridiculously few graphical-bugs what-so-ever. And for a busy guy like myself, I could alt-tab in and out of this game without any issues. Seriously, compared to emulators and other steam-releases I can alt-tab in and out of this game with no worries of crashing or messing up the resolution.   Truly a game worthy of the mighty 10/10."
"I have finished it after spending more than 100 hours.  The game totally deserves a thumb-up.  I'd say it's the best storyline in the FF series.  The system is not perfect—there's always an imperfection part in every game, to my knowledge. However, the system is enjoyable (because of that imperfection perhaps).  In short, it's highly recommended."
"Great game, i think this and FF 6 and 7 are my top 3 after playing this one. Really nice story and funny/adorable characters. Vivi is freaking awesome, best Final Fantasy character swear to god! Only thing that sucks about FF9 is the slow ♥♥♥ battles, takes forever to get through random battles sometimes. Atleast they have cheats so you can speed up parts of the game if you get impatient like me lol.   I highly reccomend playing the game if you've never experienced it when it was released (like me). Such a good game!"
Quality of the port:  The game looks very clean and runs smoothly. Autosave was added (the game saves after entering new areas).  The Game itself:  Surprisingly mature story in a fantasy setting with well written characters.  
great game just like i remember .. crashes more than my ps1 version i let my dog chew one time .. please fix
I will be the King of skipping/jump rope!!
love this game but wish they would cleanup the blurry background
"All I can say is that it has built in cheats for gil, experience and abilities. :))"
"It's my childhood games and i'm waiting this for so long, long time.  I never though Final Fantasy IX will be remaked because Square Enix seems focused on FFVII and FFXV. So i think this game is actually underrated. But now this game is remaked and released so it's great!  One of the best PS1 game! Buy this if you support Square Enix games!"
"It is a great game because it was a great game. Almost everything Square Enix touched to make this port (because it's a pc port of a mobile game ported from PS1) has been to make the game worse (in my opinion).   Still, it is Final Fantasy."
"The best remastered FF classics, reasons:  1. X360 Controller works perfectly  2. Graphical enhancements on several world items and characters are good enough without ruining nostalgia feeling 3. Some musics and sound effects are improved but not whole 4. Some unique altered gameplay portions and character sequences 5. Last but not least for me is the Boosters, since I dont have enough time to farm all over again and just wanna play for the sake of story.  9/10"
This is the most incredible video game that has ever been made. Nothing and I mean nothing has ever held a flame to this game. I have adored this game since I was a child and it has never come close to being pushed aside as my favorite of all time. If you like Final Fantasy and you have not played this you are missing out. I could not recommend this game more.
"best final fantasy of all time. I remember when i was young playing on the ps2 and having a blast, but in the last few years i have wondered when they would remake it or bring it to pc. i am s glad it finally happened. it has most likely the best characters then in any other FF. One that stands out most to me, tho, is Vivi. When playing this game he is the first one of the first people you meet and follow him till the end. During the game he progresses and becomes the person we all wanted him to be."
"Final Fantasy IX is my first serious RPG.  When it came out, I had previously played a little Pokemon and Super Mario RPG. But this was really my first full fledged one. I played it. I remember not knowing about buying new equipment... I got all the way to Gizamaluke's Grotto...  When I discovered that I had not known about a major component I started over again. Playing it right. Eventually beat it.  Now I'm really happy to be replaying it on the PC. It looks great. The only cons for me is the weird gray bars when in widescreen. Just let us make it black. Also in terms of cheats I think allowing a 1.5x, 2x exp and ap mode would have been options! I hope someone mods in HD backgrounds eventually.  Either way, 10/10. Do Chrono Cross next!"
"THIS IS AN IPHONE PORT!!??!!  I'm impressed.  Story and Characters: It's hard to talk about the story about this game. Not that it's bad, it that the game is more about the characters in the game. It's about the thief who wants to help anyone he can. It's about the princess who just wants to help her kingdom and mother. It's about a little boy who wants to know what his purpose in life is. It's about a knight trying to fulfill his duties. It's about all these characters you meet, and I like all of them. I even like the comic relief who's mainly thinking about food.  Gameplay: It's a simple battle system. keep fighting tell enemies are dead. But what I like is that each party member is unique. Equip weapons and armor allows the party to learn different abilities and is different for each one. for example: a glove might have fire magic, but only Vivi can learn that. There are also equip-able abilities that can really turn some boss into jokes like one that protects you from poison or use a potion when hit.  The biggest flaw i the game is the trance system. While the idea isn't bad, the fact you can't decide when to use it can make them wasteful. like say a very weak enemy hits you and activates the trance, but then someone kills the foe, the trance will be wasted. There are also a two mini games. one is a chocobo game where you dig for treasure in a minute, which is okay but can get annoying when you just want the special treasure and the card game, which I honestly don't like. That mainly because I really like the simple card game in FF8 and the one in 9 makes little sense to me.  Music and Presentation: I really like the art style of the game. The Character models are detailed and colorful and the backgrounds look like paintings. Even in this generation the graphics are still good. The music is also good. While there some misses in the soundtrack, most of it is memorable and sometimes even awesome, especially the track 'You Are Not Alone'. That scene plus the song is awesome.  Conclusion: If I would I recommended an RPG for some to get into the genre, I'll pick FF9 for it's beautiful world and characters and the gameplay being simple enough to play, but can be hard if you don't know what you're doing. 9/10"
CLASIC
9/10
I prefer it of the PSX Final Fantasy games. It does feel a bit aged though as RPGs are a type of game that has change a lot in the past few years. The new speed up feature helped a lot as a lot of animations are really slow. Still pretty good though.
"I first played this game when it was initially released on PS1, about 15 years ago, and although I really enjoyed it then, I got stuck at a boss on the final disc which ultimately put me off and I never picked it up again. When this appeared on Steam, I saw this as an opportunity to finish what I had started all those years ago. The port itself is very good, no performance issues unlike some of the other more recent FF ports, and the updated character models look fantastic compared to their classic counterparts. Besides that, everything appears to be exactly the same as the PS1 classic, which is no bad thing. The soundtrack has always been one of the best in the series, the story is kept intriguing with small twists throughout, and the battle system is probably my favourite of the series with the exception of FFX’s pure turn-based system. Optional side missions are plentiful, but the difficulty scaling of the main story is such that you are able to beat the final boss with fairly minimal grinding and no side missions is desired. This is definitely one of the best from the ‘golden age’ of FF games, and is absolutely worth picking up if you’re a fan of other JRPG’s of this era. Probably my second favourite FF game behind VII."
"FFIX for steam was an amazing game with its storytelling and visual formatting. Although for me, the story really starts off on a uncanny coincidence, leading to a series of events that were more filler for the central story. The real story only begins when you learn about the chaos and war that threatens to destroy the Mist continent. Regardless, there is a whole lot you can do in this game from mini-games, side-quests and exploring the world of Gaia. It is Final Fantasy so you can expect there to be a variety of end-game content. The characters at times I felt they could of been more depth for some of them especially Steiner and Amarant. I felt like they were more party members that could be told more in an interesting perspective as opposed to being characters that coincidentally joined your party. Zidane is someone I didn`t like at first. He is a bit of a showoff and ill-mannered but you begin to understand his nature a lot better as you learn of his birth. The background music was nice and the sound effects during the scenes equally complemented its tone. This was my first time playing Final Fantasy IX so it was a fresh experience for me. I was familiar with some of its characters before playing so it was nice to really narrow down their roots. Overall, its a fantastic game and one that you would like."
"I recommend this game for fans of RPGs with a history that gives the impression of having no end, I swear with FINAL FANTASY you get for your money, it's like paid cheap for a meal that we can not end because we are too full.  This game has a lot of content, a very long story , mini-games such as tetra master card games,The abilities obtained by equipment, hunts treasures with Chocobo, random quizzes , auctions , synthesizing weapons, armor and accessories , fights round by turn obviously , now that there are achievements, I highly recommend using guides , to do not miss events and rare objects.  Two awesome guides right here: ♥ With pictures:        100% Achievement Guide&nbsp;"
Probably my favorite game of all time. Looks better on steam of course. The only game booster I used (during my first run) was turning off encounters and it made the game better when I used it. Characters are deep. Settings are fascinating. Story is rich. Music is amazing. The only downside to this game is the choice between using inferior equipment or grinding to learn the abilities before you move on.
"It has an engaging story and is a must for every Final Fantasy fan.  This version has prettier details compared to the original version for PlayStation. The main characters and the cards, to name a few, have a better appearance. If one wants to play using the mouse, it is possible as well. In my opinion, Square did a great job on this one.  Totally recommend it!"
"I've been wanting to play this for years but never had the console. It's as good as I expected it to be.  Pros:  The updated models look amazing, but they're a bit jarring whenever there's a non-updated NPC nearby. The backgrounds aren't as noticeable since they're all the same quality.  Controls are great, sound is great, I can't compare them to the original but for a first-time player they're definitely holding up.  Cons:  I took Grandma's savings and wasn't given an option to put them back. :("
Love the game in 2000 Love the game now. Just beautiful.
Extremely fun and nostalgic experience. The crossover works fine just as long as you know how to set up your keys right. I tried it with the Steam controller too and it works fine.
It's prolly my favorite FF game
Finally a great PC port for a Final Fantasy game. Their best aside from the later released FFX/X-2 ports.
"One of the best final fantasy! Great story, nice characters and good soundtracks!"
"One of the best stories in RPGs that I've ever played personally. The gameplay itself, while a bit slow sometimes, is fantastic. Some of the cheats don't even take from the experience! Music is fantastic.. honestly I can't say enough good about this game.  Take control of a more unique protaganist in an epic adventure that has one hell of a twist. Never fails to keep the ups, and downs coming and surprise you to the end. Its side games are even fun! Well.. minus the annoying jump rope.  Highly recomend playing this game. Best in the FF series in my personal opinion."
"I love this game so much, and there is so much that this game stood for in my childhood. There are good things that were done in this PC port, but something is a little odd. It doesn't keep me from playing and loving the game, but they enhanced the character and interactable models, but not the backgrounds...... you'll see what I mean."
"One of my childhood games right here, I love final fantasy have played every single one of them so I've seen the good and the bad. This right here is of course the good.  Pick up the game if you don't already have it and are a FF fan! ^_^"
"Ahhhh sweet nostalga,  I managed to loose many weeks of my teenage life playing this game and it was time well spent! The steam port gives you everything you want from a remake - additinal acheievement challanges, HD graphics, savestates with the 'Continue' function and finally a chance to actually obtain the Excalibur II by speeding up everything in the game (except the timer).  The only negative is that I've been experiencing a fair few crashes with the game and were it not for the savestates they would become very tiring indeed."
"The definitive version of the game. Has never looked better, has extra support mods built-in for playing through the game the way you want to. Plays great with a controller, no issues obviously with a keyboard either."
"One of the best Final Fantasy games ever made.  Great story, characters, setting, and overall feel.  The only thing I didn't like is the wonky 'Trance' mode in the battle system."
I love this game. This game is better then the PSX release. I love the Steam overlay and the achivments are great add-on as well.
mayb it that im closer to the screen but i can small thing i did not on ps1
"I love the improvements, however it would be nice if you could select what the character repeats when you select auto durring the fight. Ex. Menu &gt;&gt;&gt; Equip &gt;&gt;&gt; Select Auto Attack Ability."
I Love this game. By far one of my favorites.
"It has an engaging story and is a must for every Final Fantasy fan.  This version has prettier details compared to the original version for PlayStation. The main characters and the cards, to name a few, have a better appearance. If one wants to play using the mouse, it is possible as well. In my opinion, Square did a great job on this one.  Totally recommend it!"
One of the best PSX games. Took the system near its limits. Wasn't a rushed product like another FF title. Great writing and character development. Just wish they had kept the original artwork in order to offer a true HD remaster like we all deserve for yet another $20.
"Final Fantasy IX was the last Final Fantasy game released on the original Playstation. It was their attempt to go back to the series' roots before enterring an era of futuristic titles. Did it work? Does it still hold up? Why don't we find out!  Final Fantasy IX is a JRPG by Squaresoft, released on the Playstation 1 in 2000. Like I said earlier, it's Square's last 'Fantasy' game before going for a futuristic approach. You play as Zidane, a thief and performer who's job is to kidnap Princess Garnet of Alexandria. When you reach the target, it is revealed that Princess Garnet wishes to be kidnapped. But why? And thus starts a timeless RPG classic!   As an RPG, you explore through the overworld, explore towns and engage in battles. Battles use the ATB system, as usual with a new twist: The Ability System. Skills are leaned by equping certain armors and weapons, allowing you to use spells and 'abilities'. Exploring caves and towns is the same as usual, this time they look alot better. Visually, this game is beautiful, the best looking game on the original Playstation in my opinion. With a few changes, it's still a Final Fantasy game, so nothing too new.  I find that it has alot of grinding, which is a bad thing. I've spent up to 5 hours grinding before a boss! Yet, then again, on that playthrough I ran from enemies alot, so it's not a big issue. Just don't run from enemies that often, the grinding isn't worth it.  In the end, Final Fantasy IX is a spectacular JRPG and a classic in the genre. It holds up well today and the PC port is great! Do yourself a favor and play this game, it's an experience you would not want to miss!  9.9/10"
Easily one of the best final fantasy games
"One of the best Final Fantasy games, I love the style and the story."
"The most underrated final fantasy game. I only have two real compliants, the first is the at style, it can really be annoying at times. The second is the villain's design."
"Perfect mix of the medieval and fantasy elements, great story"
"Awsome game, an instant clasasic and one of my favorite RPGs of all time. And always nice to be able to skip cutscenes if youve seen them all already!"
"Still just as good as when I first played it. Still funny, great characters, great storyline and minigames (Kweeehhh!!!). Only downside, background images have the same low resolution as they were in the original game. Other objects in high-res tend to stand out."
"I remember playing this game when it first came out. At the time, I considered it an 'under dog' in the Final Fantasy series because FF7 still continued to hold the spotlight for many and the Playstation 1 was getting old.  However, the game's steampunk style, charming characters, campy humor, and great music have made it a long-lasting classic in my book.  The graphics don't hold up today, nor does the pacing in some ways, but with the options available for speeding up some of the slower parts of the game and with the compliments above, I think the game still holds up really well!"
"I first played Final Fantasy IX on my hacked PSP some 8 years ago. After beating the game, I found that I loved it so much that I honestly felt guilty for pirating it, so I actually did something I (at the time) seldom did: bought a new copy of the game on PS1 immediately.  Jump forward to 2016, where I hear that Square Enix is re-releasing on Steam. The latent love I felt for Final Fantasy IX is still strong within me, so I bought it the second it became available.  I implore everyone to buy and play IX, because it is, in my opinion, the very best of Final Fantasy. It took Final Fantasy VI's and refined it to perfection; it had some of the most endearing characters ever put into a game; the soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu is perhaps his best work; everything about Final Fantasy IX is as close to perfection as an RPG has come.  So, with that said, I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone with even a passing interest in J-RPGs play Final Fantasy IX."
My favorite final fantasy game with X and VI being very close behind. It still holds up to this day. The graphics are OK. They couldn't upscale the backgrounds but they were able to drastically improve the character models and remained very faithful to the original artstyle (unlike the mobile versions of other final fantasies). The music is the best of any Final Fantasy to this day. Definitely get this game if you bought it and enjoyed it on the ps1. Don't even question yourself about getting this game if you never played it. It's fantastic.
"Thank you Square for bringing this game to Steam, because i did play this one but never complete it, i knew it was a great game, i only made it to disc 2 so didnt know too much about it, but i can say right now, after playing and complete it its my favourite FF of all time, the more i play, the more i think its perfect, amazing story, amazing combat system, best chocobos of all time, they do everything, and i found my favourite FF character of all time Vivi.  Until now my favourite FF was X , wich i still love it and i think its an amazing game, but this one taked the spot that X had. This steam version is a little different from the original one, better textures, the character models are much better, you have boosters like 9999 dmg hit, advance time, gil max, and other stuff, some boosters are activated via menu others you need to pause the game and press F1 to F5 i think. This boosters you might wanna use them if you wanna get the Excalibur II since you have the No encounter mode. This is my review for this game, if you never played it try it, if you already play it still buy it because you know this game is awesome xD."
"Final Fantasy IX remake for PC is a wonderful experience for new and returning players! The new character graphics for the remake even make Queen Brahne look hot! But Seriously the character graphics add more detail that could easily be missed if you played the original on the PS1. I recommend buying this if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy franchise and haven't experienced this adventure yet and want a great RPG experience. Or if you are a casual player that has heard of Final Fantasy IX but don't understand the gameplay mechanics of RPGs and are in it for the story then you can turn on the boosts to turn off Random encounters, hit 9999s, etc. It is a friend for the hardcore and the casual."
An all time favorite of mine. This is a game I can sink countless hours into and never grow bored.
Fabulous game a second time round. One of my favourite Final Fantasy games :)
"One of the best of the Playstation Era. I think it holds up spectacularly, and for me at least, it has a nice 'warm blanket' feeling. A must play jrpg, and in my opinion, the last of the great Square rpg's."
"Best game ever. Bought it when it released in 1996 and have been looking forward to playing it via pc since they announced, couldn't have spent my money any better."
Great game. Warning: NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!!!!!
"Since basically all PC-Ports these days are awful I don't expect much from them anymore, but this one is actually awesome and improved in just the right ways. Thanks Square Enix. The game itself is obviously great and i had a ton of fun replaying it. My body is ready for FFX Port"
"Port is interesting. It definitely needs work (fps mainly imo) and could have been much better on release (very annoying bug involving analog stick movement on a wired 360 pad), but I felt within the first few minutes of play that my purchase was a good one. I have loved this game since its original release and if you did as well I can't see any reason to not buy this version other than a desire to wait for a sale."
"Final Fantasy IX is incredible. I am so happy to finally play through this game again here on Steam. I beat it twice before and just did again for a third time.   The art design when looked at for cohession is pristene and gorgeous. The new HD models of the characters do an excellent job of looking good while not clashing too greatly with the lower-res backgrounds.   I experienced no major problems playing this game, though occasionally when booting up the game I did encounter some minor stutter, or very rarely a 'not responding' situation, but they quickly right themselves. I never experienced a CTD, and in the world of computer games, thats actually quite the accomplishment.  I didn't really touch the in-game boosters added to this version, except for the max-level one when I got a tad lazy grinding everyone to lvl. 99. But I'm sure they serve their purpose.  Of course, the true reason anyone should play Final Fantasy IX is for its story, which is masterfully told and, in my opinion, is genius in design. It may indeed be the best Final Fantasy in the way it's told. All characters and moments that are part of the story tie back to its central themes. The threads of its plot are interwoven so skillfully and moments are very impactful.  The ATB battle system can feel slow at first, though you'll quickly get used to it. The game is designed around it, and the slower pace, even compared to games like FFVII &amp; VIII, lends itself to the very strategic nature of the battles. Many bosses and even normal encounters require at least a good degree of planning and strategy to overcome, and it is quite a rewarding feeling when you succeed.  Overall, this is the Final Fantasy game that doesn't get the love or praise it deserves. It's better told than FFVII and better designed than VI. It has everything you loved from FFIV and is missing everything you hated from FFVIII. Amazing game, and after experiencing it a third time, I'd call it the best Final Fantasy.  Side Note: Tetra Master (the card game within the game), is awful, confusing, and hard, even when you take the time to learn it. You've been warned."
"One of the best Final Fantasy games from my childhood, they said they couldn't bring it to pc but here it is!"
Final Fantasy IX is an amazing game. Anyone who likes This series will love this game.
"I got this game soon as this came out on Steam because the game is a big part of my childhood. What got me really excited was the improved 3D models and HD quality CGI cutscenes but oh god, the music. It was super downgraded compared to the PS1. I hoped for a patch or a mod to solve this problem but then people found out the music was not badly compressed but the awful quality came from the way the game process it. That's a very big letdown to me. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the gamepad bug hit me like a truck, and playing this on M&amp;KB was too weird for me. Yet, all the improvements, especially the HD cutscences, they brought me back in time. That thrill whenever the CGI kicks in - it refreshs my childhood memories a lot.  And that's why I paid for the Steam Controller just so I can play this gem in peace. What I enjoy most is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. I know a lot of people find it annoying, but the feeling of improvement as the chocobo levels up and becomes capable of finding new treasure is freaking great. Bottom line is this game is a great game. Full price may be a bit much but on sale, this is a must get."

"One of the best Final Fantasy games, I love the style and the story."
The best Final Fantasy ever made.
Game stands the test of time. Great story and gameplay. A nice amount of sidequests that are fun to pass time.
One of the by far best games in the series(along with FFVI). Definetly a must-buy.
Still one of my top 5 rpgs of all time. I still love playing this game and it works great on Steam.
Nostalgia in game-form. Could play it over and over again and never get tired. 10/10
"This is the best game experience i have ever had it,s so perfeckt in any way. The caractars you meet in this game is what make this one of my favoritte games of all time."
"Great story, characters and game overall. A must have for any fan of rpgs"
What else can i say? The Classic FF9 on PC. Need i say more?
Best looking Final Fantasy that was released for the Playstation.
"The best Final Fantasy game, before FFVIII spread to infect the entire rest of the series."
"Without a doubt, the best Final Fantasy on steam. All those angsty haters who love FFVII more must have skipped this FF, because it is what every Final Fantasy should esteem to be. So glad it finally has a PC port."
"The first video game I ever played, so there was no way I could pass it by when it launched on steam. It has a brilliant story and a range of great characters. 10/10"
"My very first Final Fantasy game i ever played. Still to this day my favorite game from the series. Memorable characters, non depressed main character. Whats not to love?"
Nostalgia in game-form. Could play it over and over again and never get tired. 10/10

This game is amazing! 10/10
"Without a doubt the best Final Fantasy ever made. Now that's is on the PC there's no reason not to play it. Best characters, best music. Those are two reasons. I don't need to think of more, so there we go. Do it."
Still one of my top 5 rpgs of all time. I still love playing this game and it works great on Steam.
"The best Final Fantasy game, before FFVIII spread to infect the entire rest of the series."
This is a really good remake of the game!
Best final fantasy ever 97/100! Few minor problems keep it from getting a perfect score  (stupid card game and a few of the mini games annoy me and one really annoying optional boss ~we all know his name!!!~). Best final fantasy song ever in Melodies of Life!
"  It only gets past silicon studios logo then just freezes? Any suggestions would be great. I haven't tryed re-installing yet, but am about to"
"I thought this port turned out pretty well. The lack of redone backgrounds was not that distracting to me, and the boosters were a nice way to re-experience the entire game in just 12 hours rather than 40."
"An excellent port of a classic PSX game.  The Thai team that revamped this game did a phenominal job of making it native to the PC. Not only does the port run incredibly smoothly and without glitches that I've found, it also looks incredibly crisp with the graphic filters they used.  All character portraits have been redone into HD versions in the menu (no more looking at Freya on the menu and trying to figure out WTF she looks like.)  Even in battle you can tell when the numbers come off the enemy during an attack sequence that they've been redone and re-animated. All fonts are clear and easily legible in high resolutions, all menus look great. Honestly, if you haven't played this or in my case if you really really wanted to beat it 10 years ago and never got around to it: this is by far the best way to play it. It blows any other final fantasy port out of the water thus far (not counting the recently released FF-X/X2.) If you played FF7 and FF8 re-releases on PC, this is significantly less half-♥♥♥♥♥. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.  Otherwise the story is decent, this FF has more of a 'kiddie' or light-hearted feel to it, but it's not entirely juvenile. Some facets are cool, but have modest gains. Most notably the Tetra Master card game; while not as punishing as FF8's triple triad, is considerably more lackluster. The cards are there for nothing other than collection value, whereas in FF8 you could use them for refining spells to add to your arsenal."
The port shows a great update in graphics and 'smoothness' of gameplay. The downside is the menu reform makes the game not so intuitive for the PSX player since all the selections are now out of place.
The best FF imho.
Been fighting Hillgigars for about 12 hours now. Still trying to get the Fairy Flute. 10/10!
"FFIX 10/10  PC Port 7/10 (no Remaster) Overall 9/10  It holds up today magnifically, best JRPG ever made the port has some gameplay improvements (autosaving, less battle encounters, being able to use boosters gameplay-wise it's a 9/10 port but they could have spent some time remaking the backgrounds to make them less blurry, you can still download third party programs that help get a better experience graphically, still.  If you have never played this game you are missing out and now there are no more excuses :)"
"I absolutely adore this game! I first played it ages ago when I was still a little kid, and playing it again not only brings on a massive nostalgia trip, but also gives me greater appreciation for the masterfully (is that a real word?) crafted story and colourful cast of characters of this game.  This game has aged well, thanks to the enhanced graphics, making it very easy on the eyes. The game is also a very decent PC port. I have not experienced any crashes or technical difficulties in my time playing the game. Customization of button mapping is available, making the game easy to control on either the keyboard or controller. Cloud save is also reliable, allowing me to transfer save files between my laptop and PC with little upload/download times with no difficulties.  All in all, this game is well worth the purchase if you are a fan on JRPG's, and makes it my hands down most favourite Final Fantasy game to date.  Now if only ALL of the PC ports were this great, we'd all live in a much happier world."
"This game is just as amazing as I remember on playstation. It works great with keyboard mouse ( I was able to impress 100% of the people and the queen) and it works great with controller.   I was very worried that this port would be garbage but square really came through on this one, a must buy if you are a FF fan."
"Great game though the pre rendered backgrounds could've also gotten a touch up like the character models. Wish they could've sped up the ATB bar abit from it's original release. Even at it's fastest it's stil quite slow compared to the other titles. The FMV's look great and has the same charm as when it was released. The music isn't as crisped as with the playstation version, but still sounds beautiful non the less. Better port compared to 7 and 8. I give it a 8.5/10 for the port and 10/10 for the game itself on the PS1."
Still my favorite game of all time.
Absoutely extremely happy to be finally able to play this game on the computer!  One of the best Final Fantasy games that I really love
This game is amazing! 10/10
favorite one of the past to play :)
One of the best games in the genre. It will always get me coming back for more.
Well just finished playing this game for the second time and its just as amazing now as it was 10 years ago. If you havent played FF9 but you like the series i would definately suggest this one to add to your library :)
"First real final fantasy game i got into (final fantasy legend 2 anyone??) loved the music, the battles, the story. Really the last real final fantasy game made. Updated character graphics are nice. Going to enjoy another playthough for sure:)    9/10 would ♥♥♥♥ off Moguo again."
"This is the game that brought me into the world of video games. It has been my favourite game since I was 8 years old.   The music, characters, artwork and storyline of Final Fantasy IX come together to create a compelling and immersive experience. For those of you who don't know much about Final Fantasy IX, the game was envisioned by its creators as the 'true' or 'perfect' Final Fantasy and was made to reflect the previous games. Easter Eggs of each previous Final Fantasy instalments can be found throughout the game, as a way to invoke nostalgia for fans of the series. As someone who first discovered Final Fantasy through this game, those details didn't initially matter. For me, this is the game I look back on and think of nostalgically. Every time I play it I can go back and discover something new as well, which really shows me how much work and detail was put into this game.   For me, what really brings this game together is its characters and how their own stories and journies come together. Each main character is trying to find their purpose in life throughout the story, and there are points in the story where you can play as some of these characters (besides Zidane, the protagonist) and really get to see things from their point of view. The player also does not have access to each party member all at once. They are slowly introduced into the story as the game goes on, and unfortunately the later members don't get fleshed out as much as the earlier ones, but they are still faced with the journey of finding themselves. FFIX also has one of the most diverse worlds and cast of characters that I've ever encountered in a game. There are so many different races and creatures that are unique, that the world feels very whimsical and dream-like.   FFIX is also very inspired by Shakespearean theater and medieval music, which gives it an old European fantasy feel that is more tactfully mastered than most other fantasy games try to achieve. Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack for this game is incredible and magical, and one of his best achievements as a composer for this series. The environments are also beautifully illustrated and it's unfortunate that they could not be remastered to a better quality for this pc port because they clash with the updated character models.   If you are looking for an rpg with a lovely story and lovely music and environment, please give this game a chance. It deserves much more love than Square Enix's marketing team thinks it deserves compared to other Final Fantasy games."
"Best FF game ever created in my opinion, great soundtrack, great characters, and makes me cry like a baby. Now that I got this all I need is a few more older square titles remastered and ill be complete. PLEASE BUY THIS RIGHT NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT. ONE OF THE BEST VIDEO GAMES EVER MADE."
"Might be the best part in the series. Definitely recommended. I replayed VIII, IX X and XIII as ports here in this one is hands down the best ported version and most definitely better than ROMs you can play on emulators. The Gameboosters ingame are a huge plus too."
"Yes, I'm aware that most of the classic FF fans would say that VII is the cream of the crop. However, I have to disagree with them.  While VII (and even VIII) are great entries in the FF series, there's something about Final Fantasy IX that takes the atmosphere and experience to a whole new level. It's the last traditional FF game from the PS One era, and it has stood the test of time incredibly well (which cannot be said for FF VII, in my opinion). I've finished the game twice, and the Steam edition is my chance to make it three.  If you only have the time and/or money for one classic Finaly Fantasy game, invest in Final Fantasy IX. You'll be glad you did. "
It's just as good as I remember. The pc-port captures the feeling from when I played it as a kid on the ps1.
1st JRPG played
God dam this game is great :D
Easily one of the best Final Fantasy games spend countless hours playing when it came out 10/10
"Though it might be a somewhat simple remaster of an absolute masterpiece, it still delivers the same magnificent adventure that was originally released over a decade ago. This time it contains some revamped textures and so-called boosts (that I would not recommend for anyone taking on the game for the first time), it's definitely a game worth considering."
"If you can let the chibi character design slide, you'll be rewarded with a satisfying Final Fantasy game... plus one of the oddest hidden super bosses you'll ever encounter. The 'improved graphics' is also a plus. I originally played this game on a console and compared it to the Steam version, and the improvement is noticeable. Too bad they didn't improve on the 2D BGs. It would have been great. You gotta give it a try!  I'm still not finished with the Steam version, but only because I don't want to rush the game this time around."
"Best chocobo mini-game/side-quest ever. I love the Hot &amp; Cold mini-game and hunting the world for treasures. Then eventually going to Chocobo's Air Garden? Yes.  Oh, and the game itself and story are pretty good too. I probably put more time into Hot &amp; Cold and treasure hunting though."
"Of the three original PlayStation Final Fantasy games, FFIX is my favorite. I think it has the best setting, characters, and most engaging story. The battle system is fun but similar to most other turn based RPGs. It also has my favorite sound track that I have listened to multiple times outside the game.  The port works great. I don’t love the look of the new UI but it works fine. I haven’t run into any bugs or problems new to this version. The new modifiers are nice to have for replays. "
What big stone! Why you all watch stone? Is stone edible? Or is for barbecue? No answer... I think I lick it. —Quina
"If you haven't played this piece of art yet, this is your moment.   If you played this game, you know it's magic, but now you have achievements and better resolution (still 4:5)"
It's a joy to play this game. The music is beautiful and gameplay so much fun.
"nostalgic music, everything exactly as i remember it. awesome rerendered icond and models too, only wished the backgrounds get redone. other than that, fantastic port!"
10/10   Huge part of my life.  Steam please give us ' The Legend of Dragoon' now
Best pick of the Final Fantasy franch
"Not without its problems, but all in all this is a decent port. And the game itself is fantastic."
"The definitive version of the game. Has never looked better, has extra support mods built-in for playing through the game the way you want to. Plays great with a controller, no issues obviously with a keyboard either."
"I love the improvements, however it would be nice if you could select what the character repeats when you select auto durring the fight. Ex. Menu &gt;&gt;&gt; Equip &gt;&gt;&gt; Select Auto Attack Ability."
mayb it that im closer to the screen but i can small thing i did not on ps1
Nostalgia in game-form. Could play it over and over again and never get tired. 10/10
"This is the best game experience i have ever had it,s so perfeckt in any way. The caractars you meet in this game is what make this one of my favoritte games of all time."
"Great story, characters and game overall. A must have for any fan of rpgs"
"My very first Final Fantasy game i ever played. Still to this day my favorite game from the series. Memorable characters, non depressed main character. Whats not to love?"
This game is amazing! 10/10
Still one of my top 5 rpgs of all time. I still love playing this game and it works great on Steam.
"Without a doubt the best Final Fantasy ever made. Now that's is on the PC there's no reason not to play it. Best characters, best music. Those are two reasons. I don't need to think of more, so there we go. Do it."
favorite one of the past to play :)
One of the best games ever made.
"Without a doubt, the best Final Fantasy on steam. All those angsty haters who love FFVII more must have skipped this FF, because it is what every Final Fantasy should esteem to be. So glad it finally has a PC port."

"Great story, characters and game overall. A must have for any fan of rpgs"
"This is the best game experience i have ever had it,s so perfeckt in any way. The caractars you meet in this game is what make this one of my favoritte games of all time."
"Possibly my favorite game of the series, it has it all and you can progress as quickly or as slowly as you like."
Best final fantasy ever 97/100! Few minor problems keep it from getting a perfect score  (stupid card game and a few of the mini games annoy me and one really annoying optional boss ~we all know his name!!!~). Best final fantasy song ever in Melodies of Life!
"In my opinion, the best Final Fantasy game of all time.   Great soundtrack, great characters, story and pretty much everything else. Really can't go wrong with this one.   Highly recommended!"
I have played almost every FF games and FF IX is one of the best.  This version of the game is currently the best that you can get IMO.
"Easily my favourite FF game, and to be able to play this on my PC is just the icing on the cake.  Definitely recommend this game."
Hours can be lost playing Tetra Master.
"Probably my overall favorite Final Fantasy title. Great story, interesting characters, fun side quests, beautiful soundtrack...an all around great game."
It's ok
"anyone who hasnt played this game, i highly reccomend you do so. a LOT of people skipped it after the crapfest that was 8 and its just unfair. this is EASILY one of the BEST RPG's i've played to date. not to say it doesnt have its flaws (the battle system could use some work) the story and side quests make up for that.  story 10/10 gameplay 7/10"
"A classic that stands the tests of Time, Final Fantasy IX's high production value and extensive polish lasts even into the modern era.   Fantastic Soundtrack, as well. Very well composed and aranged with pieces befitting characters and scenes within the story, helping every peak and valley to be more impactful than it would be alone."
"We live in an age where 'the menu looks different but it doesn't detract from the experience' is far above and beyond what is expected from PC ports of old Square games.  Please consider nominating this game for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award."
"Amazing game, still love it."
Its fun yo
One of the best games in the genre. It will always get me coming back for more.
Well just finished playing this game for the second time and its just as amazing now as it was 10 years ago. If you havent played FF9 but you like the series i would definately suggest this one to add to your library :)
My favorite final fantasy game. A journey worth taking.
A classic. Even better with the option to speed gameplay up without speeding up the game clock. It made for a mostly legitimate means of finally getting something done in the game I would have never done otherwise.
"Final Fantasy IX Rating 10/10  What can be truly said about one of the finest JRPG's of all time. In essence the characters are near faultless, they hook you in with their unique personality. The setting is very unique and brilliant. The old Square battle system at its finest before FF13 came along to ruin it. And who can forget one of the greatest protagonists in gaming, Vivi. This game is not often viewed as the best Final Fantasy but in my opinion was not just the best but was one of the best games ever."
The graphics come out smooth even when upscaling the resolution. Which is great. The only issue is that if I leave the controller plugged in I HAVE to use the controller. I can't tell it to ignore it and let me use the keyboard/mouse. Oh how I have missed equiptment ability grinds.
"Might be the best part in the series. Definitely recommended. I replayed VIII, IX X and XIII as ports here in this one is hands down the best ported version and most definitely better than ROMs you can play on emulators. The Gameboosters ingame are a huge plus too."
A JRPG that has aged remarkably well and encapsulates the rest of the final fantasy series perfectly.
The Place I will Return Someday is finally here! ; w ;
"Love the gameplay, like the gameworld. Hate the cartoonish characters."
My favourite final fantasy growing up and playing the remaster was a nice trip down memory lane. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has played the original PS1 game and even newcomers to the series 10/10
Easily the best game I've ever played.
I have played almost every FF games and FF IX is one of the best.  This version of the game is currently the best that you can get IMO.
"Easily my favourite FF game, and to be able to play this on my PC is just the icing on the cake.  Definitely recommend this game."
"'Final Fantasy IX is underrated'. 5 000 000+ copies sold. AS IF, that sounds mainstream to me! Anyway this game is beautiful. The later parts shed few tears like most good Final Fantasy games.  ***LEVEL UP:*** .Simple yet EFFECTIVE COMBAT SYSTEM using the ATB from past games .DECENT DIFFICULTY SCALING .MEMORABLE SOUNDTRACK .LIVELY CHARACTERS .Grand IMMERSION .F**king MOOGLES as save points! (Fair distribution of save points) .Variety of SIDEQUESTS to keep you busy .CLASSIC JRPG STORY telling at it's finest .PC exclusive HD MODELS  ***WIPED PARTY:*** .Outdated animations and visuals including BLURRY ENVIRONMENTS,JERKY ANIMATIONS and DATED CG CUTSCENES (this can come as expected though) .TURN-BASED not for everyone .Awkward controls in specific sections .In-game TCG feels UNFAIR at times (lost good cards against 10 yr old child xD ) .Sometimes a boss may feel too hard and yes actually wipe your party with ease, requiring GRINDING"
"FF9 is easily the best final fantasy there is, with the POSSIBLE exception of Crisis Core. I know people have their gripes (that are totally legitimate) about things like the item system, the chocobo hot and cold, etc. But its plot is great, the battle system is (almost) perfect, the characters are all memorable in their own ways with no one feeling out of place at any time, and the game itself is a love letter to the other final fantasys and thus is filled with many, many references to its predecessors.  Pick this up if you didn't play it for the PS1, and if you did pick it up here ANYway because it's still amazing and the HD graphics mean it no longer looks weird (the game tried to do too much on the PS1 and should've been on the PS2 originally)."
"Definitely my favorite Final Fantasy game, out of the ones I have played. This is the one that introduced me into the series as a kid, and I must have spent hundreds of hours on it.  +A likeable and diverse cast +Engaging Story +Incredible graphics +Long, but not bloated +Plenty of abilities, but not overly complicated gameplay +Good difficulty progression +Big open world dense with unique locations and things to do +Plenty of towns to explore +Lots of sidequests to do  -Lackluster minigames -No voice acting -Lots of missable items -Story elements can be hard to follow at times -Less customization than some previous installments -Late game grinding becomes very difficult and slow"
"Final Fantasy IX is my favourite Final Fantasy game, and after sinking over 100 hours into the Steam version I'm confident in saying that it's a worthy re-release. Some people don't like the graphical changes but I enjoy the cleaner 'remastered' look the Steam version has, and don't have a problem with the new menu. I didn't experience any problems with the game and have had a bug/glitch-free experience for the 124 hours of it I've played so far.  If you're new to Final Fantasy IX or if you have a good amount of experience with the game I can honestly say that the Steam release gives you the true FF9 experience, and is a worthy addition to the Steam library of any J-RPG fan."
My favourite final fantasy growing up and playing the remaster was a nice trip down memory lane. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has played the original PS1 game and even newcomers to the series 10/10
"NOSTALGIA  First of, i cannot express enough how freaking amazed balls i am that the soundtrack in this awesome game was not touched or changed in the slightest and that honestly made me beyond happy considering how much of a masterpiece final fantasy 9 truly is.   Playing this game on the PC/Steam version has most probably got to be one of the best and ultimate version's out there and i am beyond thrilled to have got to play the steam version in complete HD as oppossed to playing it on my PSP OR PS VITA.    SOUNDTRACK  Oh wow what can i say as previously mentioned above i can't fault the soundtrack in the version at all,   from start to finish every part of the soundtrack in each and every scene was exactly how it was when this game first got released by squaresoft at the time many years back and i am utterly glad that none of the music wasn't touched or changed otherwise i honestly couldn't see myself purchasing this game if the music was changed or upbeated so i am very content that it was all kept as the music itself reminded me of my childhood gaming on final fantasy 9.     GAMEPLAY AND STORYLINE   From start to end the gameplay cannot be faulted in the slightest, the fact you are also able to activate trance when required to make a fight a hell of alot easier as oppossed to getting trance when you are attacked is incrediable in my perspective and it makes the battles so much easier when you want to master abilities towards the end of the game if you can't be bothered to spend a lot of time investing into abilities grinding if you just want to go ahead and finish the game and wipe out the final boss etc etc but i myself decided to put so many hours of grinding but it was nice to know that the booster was there if i really wanted it.     OVERALL THOUGHTS AND SCORES  Honestly theres no doubt that final fantasy 9 is still one of the best rated final fantasy's out there however a little underrated in my view but hell this game really is a tip of the iceberg that sqaure really do invent fantastical games and really know how to capture people's emotions and get us emotionally invested into storyline's character developments etc etc and it goes without saying of course that the PC STEAM version has probably been so successful and i want to thank sqaure for going down the PC route it was the best choice they made and very smart to considering the love people truly have for this game.  With that being said if you looking to start a new journey and want to get emotionally connected with this phenomenol master piece then seriously it will be an investment you make for life and you certainly won't regret it because i sure didn't.    10/10"
The best game ever. Gripping enough to make me learn english as a 10 year old.
Even better then the playstation 1 verison i played as a kid well worth every penny spent.
"Absolutely fantastic. As much as I enjoy FF VII, IMO this trumps it. I just can't keep coming back to it, I've played through it more times than I can count, first on PS1 and now PC, and I still haven't explored everything that this game has to offer. A real gem, and such a pleasure every time."
"Yes, I'm aware that most of the classic FF fans would say that VII is the cream of the crop. However, I have to disagree with them.  While VII (and even VIII) are great entries in the FF series, there's something about Final Fantasy IX that takes the atmosphere and experience to a whole new level. It's the last traditional FF game from the PS One era, and it has stood the test of time incredibly well (which cannot be said for FF VII, in my opinion).

This is my absolute favorite Final Fantasy game!
Every bit as fun as I remember. This will always be my favorite of the FF series.
"Awsome game, an instant clasasic and one of my favorite RPGs of all time. And always nice to be able to skip cutscenes if youve seen them all already!"
"Awesome game, sweeping story and induces real emotion"
It's just as good as I remember. The pc-port captures the feeling from when I played it as a kid on the ps1.
One of the best Soundtracks ever...
A very good port. The super speed cheats really help with dealing with the level grind normally found in most Final Fantasy games and allows you the option to just experience the story and epic boss fights. I currently play with a gamepad but keyboard works just fine too.
"We live in an age where 'the menu looks different but it doesn't detract from the experience' is far above and beyond what is expected from PC ports of old Square games.  Please consider nominating this game for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award."
got a 100 of a 100
This game is an instant classic back to the PS1 era. Now having it ported to the PC is a wonderfully nostalgic feeling combined with excitement.
Love how they have remastered all these final fantasy's...now bring them all to the PS4 and I'll be a happy camper!
"Let me just start by saying this is my favorite game of all time. This is the one game I could play a hundred times and never feel bored by the story or the characters. The one game where the story just feels perfect while having it's few real imperfections nicely balanced out.  So naturally do not expect this to be an unbiassed review.  Let me also say I have never played any other Final Fantasy game with the eception to 10. And anyone who got through that, got bless you, you have far more tollerence for it than I did.   FFIX opens with a botched kidnapping and a long slow build of intreague. Anyone who says the newer Final Fantasy games take a while to get going won't have to worry here. There's just enough intreague and subtle hints at something building almost from the outset that, as long as you read closely, won't leave you bored.  I'd also like to say that, for the extreme completionists, the cheats they've added to the game really speed things along if you're not into the whole 'level grinding' thing. However, be mindful that using some of them will prevent achevements during gameplay. That's just how it is.  All in all this game is good and fun and a worthwhile romp with many scenes you'll want to see again to try things a different way and see different results of events. (Poke the barrel, put the bug in the stew, etc.) Wonderful game. And best of all, no whining, emo, brooding protagonist. :P"
Good memory.
"Lackluster port, fantastic game."
"Any true final fantasy fan should tell you that this game is their favorite.   So first off I want to adress the fact that this IS a good release of the FF9. Some of the steam re releases of classic final fantasies have felt...lacking. That is not the case here.   With that out of the way, this is by far, my all time favorite game. As much as I love the diversirty of Final Fantasies 'job system' FF9 does have set roles for each party member, that aside, everything from the leveling and skill system, including combat, to the story, this game, to me, is nothing short of perfect. I have purchased this game at least 4 different times, and never once have I regretted it.   That being said, I would never say 'if you have to play one final fantasy make it this one'. What truly makes FF9 so great is where it stands in the franchise. The three games prior to this in the franchise could have bordered on science fiction. The type of 'fantasy' portrayed in the games priror to this could border on science fiction compared to 9. When I hear the word fantasy this game is what comes to mind. However in order to trulty appreciate everything about this game, I dare say it is required to play most if not all of the final fantasies before it."
The best Final Fantasy game from Square Enix hands down. This was the first RPG game i've played when i was a kid. Love this game a lot.
Still one of the best Final Fantasy games! Absolutely brilliant!
"Just play it. Beautiful setting, beautiful story, in my opinion nice battles. Sidequest very big and rewarding. Only thing that sucks in the PC Version is the 8 direction controlls and the cheats, just dont use them, they ruin the fun."
Hype 100% activated 
"Still the best numbered Final Fantasy to date. Good mechanics, involved story, great designs, world building, and characters, and fantastic music. No other Final Fantasy is as completely good across the board."
Trailer here on Steam already gets me right in the feels the moment the music starts.
The best game ever. Gripping enough to make me learn english as a 10 year old.
"One of the best FF games ever. The HD update mostly only covered models for the main characters so the game doesn't look nearly as good as it could, but is still more than worth playing."
"Loved replaying this remastered version of the game nearly as much as 12 years ago when I was 15 years old. I used to wake up so early in the weekends just to play this in the small TV we had in the kitchen...god damn... Great story, nice soundtrack and some good minigames to entertain you for 60+hours!"
"FF9 is easily the best final fantasy there is, with the POSSIBLE exception of Crisis Core.

SOUNDTRACK  Oh wow what can i say as previously mentioned above i can't fault the soundtrack in the version at all,   from start to finish every part of the soundtrack in each and every scene was exactly how it was when this game first got released by squaresoft at the time many years back and i am utterly glad that none of the music wasn't touched or changed otherwise i honestly couldn't see myself purchasing this game if the music was changed or upbeated so i am very content that it was all kept as the music itself reminded me of my childhood gaming on final fantasy 9.     GAMEPLAY AND STORYLINE   From start to end the gameplay cannot be faulted in the slightest, the fact you are also able to activate trance when required to make a fight a hell of alot easier as oppossed to getting trance when you are attacked is incrediable in my perspective and it makes the battles so much easier when you want to master abilities towards the end of the game if you can't be bothered to spend a lot of time investing into abilities grinding if you just want to go ahead and finish the game and wipe out the final boss etc etc but i myself decided to put so many hours of grinding but it was nice to know that the booster was there if i really wanted it.     OVERALL THOUGHTS AND SCORES  Honestly theres no doubt that final fantasy 9 is still one of the best rated final fantasy's out there however a little underrated in my view but hell this game really is a tip of the iceberg that sqaure really do invent fantastical games and really know how to capture people's emotions and get us emotionally invested into storyline's character developments etc etc and it goes without saying of course that the PC STEAM version has probably been so successful and i want to thank sqaure for going down the PC route it was the best choice they made and very smart to considering the love people truly have for this game.  With that being said if you looking to start a new journey and want to get emotionally connected with this phenomenol master piece then seriously it will be an investment you make for life and you certainly won't regret it because i sure didn't.    10/10"
"Amazing game with unparalelled story telling, I rember getting it on PS1 and the Prima guide for my birthday years and years ago. My first FF and imo the best."
Still one of the best Final Fantasy games! Absolutely brilliant!
Hype 100% activated 
"Still the best numbered Final Fantasy to date. Good mechanics, involved story, great designs, world building, and characters, and fantastic music. No other Final Fantasy is as completely good across the board."
"My second favorite FF game, sadly this one is so overshadowed by the others it seems. This is the first FF game I ever beat."
"'Final Fantasy IX is underrated'. 5 000 000+ copies sold. AS IF, that sounds mainstream to me! Anyway this game is beautiful. The later parts shed few tears like most good Final Fantasy games.  ***LEVEL UP:*** .Simple yet EFFECTIVE COMBAT SYSTEM using the ATB from past games .DECENT DIFFICULTY SCALING .MEMORABLE SOUNDTRACK .LIVELY CHARACTERS .Grand IMMERSION .F**king MOOGLES as save points! (Fair distribution of save points) .Variety of SIDEQUESTS to keep you busy .CLASSIC JRPG STORY telling at it's finest .PC exclusive HD MODELS  ***WIPED PARTY:*** .Outdated animations and visuals including BLURRY ENVIRONMENTS,JERKY ANIMATIONS and DATED CG CUTSCENES (this can come as expected though) .TURN-BASED not for everyone .Awkward controls in specific sections .In-game TCG feels UNFAIR at times (lost good cards against 10 yr old child xD ) .Sometimes a boss may feel too hard and yes actually wipe your party with ease, requiring GRINDING"
"Final Fantasy 9 is the last instance of the traditional JRPG FF format. It perfects the formula, providing 40 to 60 hours of linear storytelling with little need for grinding. If it is refined, however, it shows the flaws of JRPGs all the more.  Pros: Comprehensive story for the first two discs (Usually) likeable lead characters. Zidane is a protagonist who runs his fat mouth, Dagger actually upgrades beyond toy princess, etc. Little to no grinding required to keep up with combat. Chocobo hot and cold, a cute minigame of seeking with a chocobo Well diversified cast allow for a good set of party compositions. Port version comes with neat features like a Continue (based on last screen exit), movie viewer, and...blackjack? Okay.  Cons: Story gets increasingly incoherent in the second half Secondary characters and attempts at saucy humor usually fall completely flat. Slow pace of combat. Mostly loading screens and other artifacts of the PS era. Over reliance on status effects for combat variety. If you have the right status guards equipped, most guards are a snoozefest while you wait for Zidane to steal their goodies. Pixel ♥♥♥♥♥ing. So much pixel ♥♥♥♥♥ing. Penultimate and ultimate weapons that require checking corners while spamming the search button.  Neutral Funky artstyle that hasn't really aged well Tons of child endangerment. Why are we allowing the six year old to hang out with us again? Useless mini games. Want to outrun a hippo furry child? FF9 has it. Want to skip rope until your eyes bleed? FF9 has it!  If you have never played a FF game, this is a solid entry to pick up. If you have played an 'old' FF game and liked it, pick this up. If you didn't really care for older FF entries or you want a seamless fast-paced experience, skip this."
"A love letter to Final Fantasy and it's fans, Final Fantasy IX is full of glorious homages and nods to the series' roots. Enter one of the greatest Final Fantasy games there is as you save a Princess from a corrupt monarchy and embark on a world of adventure. Hours of fun and challenge from a game that so many didn't even know existed! If you love RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play Final Fantasy IX."
"So happy FFIX had been released on Steam. The FF games have been hit or miss. FFVI was was done well whereas FFVIII was a jacked up port. FFIX has updated graphics and plays seamlessly. Great story, awesome skill upgrades, and great graphics."
"A classic that stands the tests of Time, Final Fantasy IX's high production value and extensive polish lasts even into the modern era.   Fantastic Soundtrack, as well. Very well composed and aranged with pieces befitting characters and scenes within the story, helping every peak and valley to be more impactful than it would be alone."
The best Final Fantasy game from Square Enix hands down. This was the first RPG game i've played when i was a kid. Love this game a lot.
"Firstly, going to talk about the port itself: Its good. It features improved character models (which are so much better), increased performance, an auto battle mode, more tutorials and the cleaning up of text and menus. Now, onto the review itself.  Well, this game is delievered to say the least! Perhaps what surprised me the most is how well everything holds up. Sure, it may not look current-gen - but the graphics aren't an eyesore to look at, and sometimes the prerendered backgrounds are breathtaking. My only grip is that they didn't de-compress the backgrounds from the original PS1 version. As for the layout and menus, everything is clean slick - and clearly indicated. Not to mention that the story is a classic return-to-the-roots Final Fantasy story; which is something that any longtime fan can dedicate he/herself to easily. Without a doubt, this is one of my favourite Final Fantasies. If you're new to Final Fantasy and can deal with a bit of aging and mid-poly graphics, then I highly reccomend this as your first one. But its your choice. Games like these are a select taste, and if you like reading and character development - and everything that Final Fantasy has in abudance - you'll have a blast with this."

"Enjoying the heck out of this game, the card game is addictive as hell, the dialogues are fun, music is great - story-telling and characters are amazing."
"Enjoyed revisiting familiar places and meeting with my old friends. My only wish now is to have a macOS port for this wonderful game, and then my life would be complete."
"2nd Time Playing This except I beat it this time. My personal opinion about this game seems really cartoony &amp; goofy blended in with a serious concept.  - Leveling system is unique,  - Weapons and Accessories comes with their own technique and ability. - Amazing story, (mostly funny) CLASSIC = 10 outta 10"
My all time favorite Final Fantasy game. Love being able to start to finish play as a thief. Wonderful storyline with a beautiful soundtrack that enhances those ever so dramatic moments and cutscenes. An old game that will always have a place in my heart for the loveable and pervy Zidane.
"I love this game. My favorite final fantasy game and one of the best games i've EVER played. I don't have words to describe this game. The storyline is awesome, the characters are awesome, the world is awesome, the minigames are awesome... The only problem this game has it's not even because of the game, it's because of the PC port. You ocasionaly have framerate drops. I would rate this game easily a 10/10. Recommend everyone to buy this."
"I could tell you to buy this game. I could say that the story is amazing, full of emotions, a lot of surprises and earth shattering discoveries. I could say that the gameplay is enjoyable, a classic among classics, something that will reward you for your time. I could say that you will spend a hundred hours finding everything in this game. Or you could buy it and find by yourself. P.S. Thats a positive review folks, just in case."
"I finally gotten around to see why people like FF9, and so far I'm enjoying it. Though I recommend disabling all of your built-in controllers, due to this weird adapting to all of these controllers and the game reading your movements as 'Holding down a button? Sure'. The way to do that is if using Windows 10 search Device Manager, and then go to 'Human Interface Devices', and disable all of the 'controller' devices such as all of the Compliant Game and system controller, and if you are still having controller problems disable vJoy Device. There is a glitch that happens with certain controllers such as PS4 or Xbox One. I finally gotten it to be done with this bullsh*t once vJoy Device was disabled. It has something to do with the built-in mouse features for this game most likely, since the controler is like 'Wait...what is that?' and goes haywire."
"Disclaimer: Rest assured this is the game we know and love.  HOWEVER. The backdrops are the original PS1 quality versions whilst interactable objects and playable characters have been remastered, so there's a jarring disconnect.   Some of the NPCs have been remastered, some haven't and I'm getting the distinct feeling they either rushed this, or were really lazy. Different things like ( edit: some ) chests not being animated, or not being layered so they fit in with the backdrop ( e.g. they should be partially concealed but are just pasted on ).  I'm getting used to it, but its only because I love this game and haven't played it for ages - and I'm willing to bet that's what they're banking on.  It would be pretty cool if someone modded the game with cleaner backdrops, or used some of the fanart out there.  Really lazy port, at least visually, in my opinion.  EDIT:  There are some valid points in the comments here.  I'm assuming most of you have played the original, and therefore you'd be happy to agree with my assessment of this title still being 'the game we know and love' - hell, its the reason I impulse bought it on day of release.   As a consumer I would want to get all the facts before making a purchase ( especially with all the Early Access / Assassin Creed / Batman controversy ) and I am happy to post what I don't like about a game I am enjoying, so other potential consumers have all the facts."
"It pains me to have to write this because Final Fantasy IX is my favourite and possibly the best Final Fantasy to be released. That being said, this port is just not worth the money.  There are audio bugs rampant everywhere from sound effects being way too loud and clipping the audio near deafening you if you're wearing headphones, to audio just cutting out for apparently no reason. The HD models are nice but with the backgrounds just being upscaled from 144p (or whatever it was) there can be a huge disconnect at time and it can just look plain bad. The framerate can dip (Most notably on the world map when you have a chocobo, ship or airship) down into the 10's for a number of seconds or just straight up freeze for no reason, with a game that's already locked at 30 or sometimes 20 depending on if you're on a normal screen or the map/battle this is very disappointing.  Going back to the models it's clear some were given more love than others, models like Garnet and Steiner look fantastic whilst people like Zidane and Eiko still have these weird awkward faces that look ridiculously out of place. Most NPC's models have just been upscaled too and when standing next to the player models they look terrible. One of the biggest irks I had was the issue of no longer having infinite analogue control movement. instead of being able to run in any direction like you could in the Playstation 1 version of the game, for some reason this game only lets you run in 8, meaning you will get caught on the scenery A LOT and when you're playing something like Chocobo Hot 'n' Cold it can lead to a lot of frustration.  Like I said I hate having to put this, but I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Just buy the port on PSN if you want to play it OR play the original version on Playstation."
i love this game with all my heart but the game crashed when you have to summon alexander so i can't say it's worth it if you dont mind 2/3 of a game then get it
"Let me preface this review by saying I love SE, and it really pains me to write this.  If you go and look at the reviews for this game, which many of us have been patiently waiting for several months for since it was announced and delayed, you'll see many thumbs up. But if you look at the discussion forums, you'll note that half of the entries are from people where the game is simply too buggy to play. I'm one of those people and I do not want anyone to buy this game and waste their money until SE patches the game.  The problem is the controller interface. If you have an Xbox 360 controller there is, for unknown reasons, a 50/50 chance the game will be unplayable for you. You can update all your drivers, and in the forums people have rituals they're trying to do to make it work (similar to blowing in an NES cartridge back in the day). But the bottom line is, the PC version of the game was a direct port from the smart phone version, and the programming for the controls was not done well. If you have an Xbox One controller, the game will be unplayable. For me it's so bad with the One controller that I can't even make it past the start menu. The problem is so bad for both of these controllers that if I had them plugged in at all at any time before I start the game, I can't even play with my keyboard! I literally have to go into my device manager and turn off Human Interface Devices and enable only my KB and Mouse as peripherals. And I have to do that every time I want to attempt to play with my KB (which kills the experience for me anyway).   So in sum, you're playing roulette with purchasing this game. And the sad part is, the opening week deal will be over before they patch it, if they even do. I personally am considering the 16 dollars spent on this a donation to SE, since I don't feel like going through the hassle of getting a refund. I own FFVII, FFVIII, FFXI, FFXIV, and Lightning Returns, all on Steam. And every one of those titles works just fine with both the 360 and the One controller with default device drivers. I guess SE had their 'B team' working on this particular title... =/"
"oh where to begin...  Like others here, I have great memories of playing this back in the day. I even went as far as to install it on an sd card for my PSP. So understand when I say that i love FF9, that I really do, despite this review. Sadly, despite the improvements to image quality, this is a far from being a perfect port.  Pros:  1. Music from the original game is retained and NOT replaced with crappy midi, so enjoy the original score.  2. Background Image clarity is good compared to what it is on PS3. I've had to play it on a PSP (very small screen) to get close to a sharp image.   3. Character sprites look clear and sharp.  4. This is FF9, one of my most favorite FF's.  Cons:  1. Despite support for 1920x1080, the actual game screen does not stretch to fit monitor, leaving a 2 inch dark gap on both the left and the right side of the screen. This is not a good thing (at least playing it on PS3/PSP i can stretch that image to fit). Check the images above on the store page and you will see the border I am referring to.  2. Terrible Font used in the game's text. The orignal game used a very unique looking font (check out peeps Youtube playthroughs of original and see for yourself), the style of which, fit the game wonderfully. Despite the clarity and sharpness of the text, this port's Font looks like it got ripped from RPG Maker ACE or something.  3. The redone (and very blocky looking, at least to me) battle menu is too large and looks like it was made for ANDROID, as a result, it fills more of the scrren than it had originally filled on the PS1/PSP/PS3. The combination of this and the replaced font, just feel wrong. As a result, I find myself wishing that the game at least had UI resizing or transparency options to offset this somewhat...  4. The built in game cheats (which i do not use), cannot be turned off once turned on.  5. The 'Quit' button is hidden in the config sub menu, rather than the main part of the menu. Seriously, it is actually hidden at the bottom of the Config sub menu so that you actually have to scroll down and find it. Just sad...  6. Other than resolution and the choice to play in'windowed'mode, the game 'options' are not accessable until you are 'in-game', no options menu appears on the start up.  7. Backgrounds still not as clear as they should be for PC.  For Android this is fine I guess, but for a PC version, It just feels 'half-@$$ed' to me.  Will I be playing FF9? You bet I will...on the PSP"
"I love this game, I really do. The nostalgia is strong with this one, and I bought the PC Steam port the day it came out.   But... really, Square? Update the character models but not the background, having high-quality characters on a PAINFULLY low resolution background?? It takes away greatly from the work put into updating the models Because they seem like cutouts plastered on a low res jpeg (but in the screenshots on steam, they have been painted over!).   Same UI setup from the mobile game, which isn't great on a 16:9 computer screen? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu controls and lack of ability to customize buttons? Far out, guys. I knew you were stingy and look for any way to make more money - and yes I have bought, and will play this game because it is one of my favourites of the series - but you didn't even have the regard to treat this port with the dignity it deserves. Poor form. Poor form everywhere.   If this game isn't patched with updated backgrounds, I'm likely never spending a cent on your games again, and might even refund this one."
"FFIX is a good game. No complaints with the game itself.  However, this port of FFIX has an incredibly obnoxious bug where the title menu glitches and locks up if you start the game with a wireless Xbox One controller turned on and paired with your computer. I've had to find a workaround just to play the game at all, because as soon as it locks up there's no way to start a new game, load a saved game or quit the program without forcing Windows to end the process.  I was willing to overlook this, but I've since encountered a similar, even more severe glitch in I Am Setsuna, which I haven't been able to play at all. These kinds of obvious bugs are completely unacceptable in a 'professional' product, and it looks like it's becoming a recurring issue for Square Enix games. I will gladly remove or amend this review if the problem is fixed."
"Put aside all aesthetic considerations (some might like it, some might not, that's really a personal thing).  The game core is, obviously, the good 'ol FF9 we know and love.  But... the port is really, really broken. I wouldn't care that this is an Android emulation if it worked properly.  I encountered a game breaking bug a lot of times. A simple crash that a is OK when you just entered a zone ('cause it seems there is a 'silent' autosave feature), but can be quite discouraging when happening in a long combat or in a farming session.  So I'll advise to wait for a correction from Square for this pricey trip to memory lane.  And if you want a Final Fantasy this much, I got FFX too and it works like a charm while being a lot more visually coherent."
"Pros: New graphics are great.  Cons: This port is almost there, but the poor quality of the audio tracks really takes me out of the game. Because of that, I can't recommend paying for this. There are other ways to play it that are cheaper, and where the audio quality isn't compromised. The current audio in this port is disrespectful to Mr. Uematsu's work. If they patch it, I will change my review."
I've hard a lot of technical difficulty with the game so far. I can't normally run it from the steam client. Prior to the most recent update I was able to manually launch the .exe file to play. But since the most recent update I am unable to even launch the .exe file. I would not suggest buying this game until this technical issue is resolved.  I'm quite disappointed that Sqaure Enix would have such trouble.
"Not recommended for PS4 controller users, just released an undocumented patch that breaks controller input and breaks the settings page in the games menu for controllers."
"OMG I wanted to love this game. I REALLY did. So many good fond memories.   But so far, as of today 29 APR 16, I cannot. The only, ONLY controller I can get to work with this is the steam controller and only if I use the dongle and do steam play (either through my link or on my PC)  It's maddening I tell you. Also if you steam link to your TV don't even bother with jump roping. Seriously.   It's 2016 and we can't make this came 16:9? Really SS? REALLY? Meh, that's how I feel, let down."
"I want to give this game a positive review due to it being my favourite childhood game, however the work they put in this is what annoys me the most hence why I must give this a THUMBS down so SQUARE can get their act together and fix this  Cons: - Xbox one controller issue - If you leave it plugged in before starting the game, it will get confused and you will always be going to the LEFT, to fix this issue you have to start the game without the controller and then plug it in once you are in the NEW GAME/LOAD GAME etc menu, it is very annoying always having to do this! (Unsure about 360 controllers, but should be the same)  - Cheap port from the iOS / Android where it still has that ugly grey background so you cannot truely have the full resolution ---&gt; I did find a mod to fix this, but that mod does not satisfy me.  - Battle UI is so CRAMPED ! you can barely see your characters or the DAMAGE they take as the UI is covering it !!! This was more utilized for the mobile gaming hence the cheap port  - World map is so huge as well as the chocograph in the way, they should have kept this the same as the PS1 version - Android/iOS saves do not sync over the cloud, you have to go out of your way and transfer it (Only found method for Android) - Honestly, all the above needs its fix !!! - Also notice some characters portraits have been swaped such as FREYA (Not much of a hassle, but I still prefer the classic)  - Some sound effects are very loud with headphones (Noticed on card game)   Pros: - Many side quest - Turbo mode (F1 key) to skip long dreadful random battles - Updated HD textures  - Good story - Mini games etc - Music  Square, please fix this issue don't leave this master piece slightly broken and let modders fix the game for you!"
"Buy at your own risk! can not play the game at all! i read all the good reviews and i was very excited, the only bad things anyone had to say was the sound and that the back ground was still grainy. i went through the first 7o or so reviews and saw nothing over whelmingly negative. so i bought the game, and the controles do not work, it sticks moving right if i do not use a controller, so i plugged in a ps4 controller and it only moves to the left. i went to the forums and found out this is a large issue, people say you can play with it windowed, others saying it has to be windowed etc. This was a massive waste of 20 dollars and i would not reccomend you buy it, but who knows maybe you'll get lucky."
"So! The HD looks nice.  now to the problems. the controls are only partially adjustable, enter and space are not changable. Why? Who knows.  You can now control the game with a mouse...! but once again you don't get a choice in the matter. I'm playing on a laptop, the mouse centers regularly, so i've accidentally attacked my own team several times. My biggest gripe is they have introduced cheats, and these are confusing, iritating and keep turning themselves on. For some reason no encounters turned iteslf on and i had to reset the fame early on (it went as it came in, it just happened!). Quite late into the game, everyone was on audo trance. What the hell?!"
"Ah, Square. As usual, they've ♥♥♥♥ed up the PC port of an usually fantastic game. This time they didn't turn it into a subpar mobile game with terrible graphics; it does look better than the original, but at the cost of gameplay.  The loading times between FMVs and battles are ridiculously long; up to a minute. There's an odd input lag and when it kicks in, the controls just slip all over the place. You need to go through more interfaces than is really necessary (choose a slot, then choose a slot again? why?) to save the game, and it takes ages; even compared to the original version.  I'd say the only good thing about this port (as with literally all of Square's Steam ports) is the presence of achievements but even that seems to not work for many people and as usual, don't expect a patch from Square anytime soon since they pass on to another project the second they release anything."
"Another lazy PC port of a classic Squaresoft game.     - Main character models have been improved, but most other models are left untouched   - Backgrounds are untouched and badly filtered   - Audio is quite inferior and tinny compared to the original, either from over-compression or because of the playback engine   - Menus are straight from the mobile version without any resizing or other tweaking to make them fit better on larger screens   - Original font has been replaced with a generic one that does not fit in with the aesthetic of the game   - No graphical options other than resolution   - Bad controller support   - Reports of crashing and other game-breaking bugs from some people, even when the game was presumably being worked on for a while after the release of the mobile version   - Zero support from the developers so far    This amazing game deserves better treatment, but it's just what I expect anymore from SquEnix."
"Character sprites are remastered but the backgrounds are not. It causes a really jarring and distracting effect on the game. I sincerely tried to look past this, but coupling that glaring issue with the fact that combat is PAINFULLY slow I cannot recommend this port.   Yes I am aware that there is a speed boosting feature, but you have to pause the game, hit R1, then unpause to resume. Had they just allowed you to hold R1 to get the speed boost when you wanted it (when waiting for combat commands to complete or ATBs to fill for example) then it might have compensated for the slow combat."
"This port is basically a direct rip from mobile, and it shows. I can go on and on but take my advice. This is not a quality port. Even before the title screen, you see 'Silicon Thailand' on it. If you still want to try it out though to test steam's refund policy, be my guest. But really, you should be playing another version besides this one if you truly love FFIX."
"Was really looking forward to this game - I'd rented it as a child, and had to return it before I finished the game. For almost 16 years I have avoided spoilers, as I was never able to purchase a copy of the PS1 discs when I live in New Zealand (at least, not for less than several hundred $!) - so needless to say, I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on PC.  I was under no illusions - I did not expect this to be an HD remake or to be absolutely perfect, it is after all a port of a very old console game to PC.  However, I can't even get beyond the first room (the black one with the candle) in this port - Zidane constantly runs to the right, no matter what I do. I have checked for sticky keys, or some overriding command which would cause this (there is none), conflicting applications that could be causing issue (none that I can tell), there is no help online anywhere!  If this issue was fixed, I'm sure I would absolutely be thrilled with this game."
"I would love to give this game a positive review, but until Square fixes this issue, I have to make this a black mark. I have no damn audio. I've sent in a support ticket to Square, but after sending in my msinfo, they asked me how their customer service was. No, I'm not kidding. It's as if they closed my ticket and ignored my issue... If I don't get this fixed, Square, I WILL find a way to get a refund on the game (I was given it, but I should probably get the credit).   Listen Square, if you want a good review, FIX YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE! FIX THE DAMN GAME! There's numerous issues on the forums that you have yet to even publicly acknowledge. Disgusting, simply disgusting.  I'll do a more thorough review when I can finally play it properly -.-  I'll be doubling this up with a BBB complaint. I'm gonna get some progress."
"I gave this port and honest try, I really did. I even tried every work-around I possibly could including third party solutions but I couldn't ever get my right arrow, or right d-pad to register. I used a PS4, 360 and Xbone 1 controller but all of them could never register right. I tried Joy2Key but even then the game refused to recognise the 'right' direction. My gameplay ended at the play, trying to impresss 100 nobles was a thoroughly impossible task.  I got a refund in frustration and don't feel one bit guilty. Getting the port to even play properly frustrating. If you leave a controller in while the game boots the controls go haywire. I can't recommend this port to anyone especially at the steep pricepoint of 21 bucks."
Game keep crashing. ThreadCount error.
I would recommend this game if it didn't crash for me right at the first battle! Fuming.
Is it so much to ask that a widely reported bug which renders the game unplayable and occurs in the very first room of the game is fixed by the day 10 mark?
I played this game for hours on end when it came out on PSX. But now there is NO ♥♥♥♥ING PS CONTROLLER SUPPORT! Why the F not?
"I've loved FF9 for years. One of, if not my favourite FF's. But this port is unplayable for me. Character is constantly stuck walking right. After spending hours in the disscusion forums trying every possible fix with no success (deleting other controller remappers, unplugging controllers, redownloading the game and more), I had to give up. If they fix this game I may reconsider my purchase. But as of this time I can't reccomend this game to anyone."
"As a big fan of FF9 from the original PS1 this port is a dissapointment. Fonts and large battles UI is horrendously awful and didn't bother changing from the mobile's version. The HD remodels for the characters should be an improvement, but looks so awkard and bad with the original prerender background.    Honestly, just stick to the original copy of the game."
"This is a port of a Mobile version of FF9 and has many UI and control problems. I requested a Steam Refund for this title as it is not in a playable PC state, comes with very, very little graphical options or updates and as I kept my PS1 copy, I'm more than happy to wait on a real PC version of this game to come along.  Some of the sounds, especially during the card minigame are horribly EQed as well and aren't a patch on the original PS1 classic. (The noise of the card game made me want to stop immediately.)  Shameful port of one of the best games of all time. :("
Wait for the patch to come out. Cannot play at all with any controller because it'll glitch out and not allow you to move at all. Couldn't even get past the menu. Too bad too because I've never played this Final Fantasy yet and I've been very eager to try it out.
"I have been wanting to play this game for awhile so I was excited to see that it finally was released to PC. However, when I started it up almost instantly the problems and disappointment began.  When you go into a cutscene you will have an FPS cap of 15 - 16. When you enter a battle you get capped at 30 FPS and that is about as good as it is going to get. Considering how big of a title FF is, I was expecting a bit more optimization. Completely disappointed.  If you've never played this game before, I'd suggest waiting for a sale on it before going in, as the game is fun overall it just needs way better optimization.  TLDR; Fun game and will send you on a nostalgic trip but needs a lot more touching up."
"Though this is one of my favorite games of all time, Square had to ruin it with poor UI and controller issues. I love the game, but I would recommend against buying until a patch comes through to fix the issues...if it ever does."
"So far unable to play due to mouse issues. When I start up the game the mouse centers on the screen and I am unable to press new game, or anything really. I have to alt tab to exit."
For some unknown reason I can't stop the character from moving left and I barely got through the menu with this flaw. it's unplayable and I have no Idea why I'm experiencing this bug.
Not playable on win 10 with Xbox one controller.   Controller keeps pressing left down .. you even cant choose 'new game'.
"The upscaled 3D characters look good enough, but the blurry backgrounds look like someone took the Playstation originals and applied some horrible blur and edge detection effect to them. Might not look that bad on a mobile phone screen, but on a PC it really is horrible.  Make no mistake, this is a great game, but the PC version is a horrible conversion. If you really want to experience this game then track down a secondhand copy of this game for Playstation and if possible play it on a CRT TV using an RGB cable."
"Before you buy the game you will need to know the negatives and positives of the game:  Negatives/Mehs: - Does NOT have Widescreen support, you will have gray bars on the sides of your screen as shown in Screenshots - Uses the Mobile version's UI and it does take up a lot of the screen during battle - Locked at 30fps, personally never expected otherwise but still needs mentioned for others  Neutral: - Price, sorry but I was expecting 15-16 bucks tops, so I wasn't that happy with the launch price but if cash isn't an issue for you or you're fine with the price go ahead and count this as a Positive.  Positives: - New Character Models look amazing, but don't always mix well with the backgrounds - HD Cutscenes look great, but it's hard to miss when not everyone shown are using the new models - Toggle Cheats/Options, they can enhance or ruin your experience with the game, so do take care when using them  Final Verdict: If you were already gonna buy the game, then chances are you already bought it as soon as you saw it and this review isn't for you, this is for people that are hesitant and want to research the products they're thinking about buying before they spend their hard earned dollar. I completely understand the love for this game, it's my favorite in the series, but I was expecting a little more effort out of SE and if modders fix the issues I have, I'll re-buy the game and change my review to Recommended and link all the mods that fix the issues, but until then I'll pass."
Used to love this game back on the playstation so bought it..  installed it on win7 everything was fine (until it crashed 15 min into the game) upgraded to win 10 now the controller (xbox one original) isnt working so havent played it since.  I love to see the old FF games on the pc and have the opportunity to play them again. But.. releasing things this buggy is just not fair.  Sad to say it but not worth the money at it's curent state.
"Worst port ever made. Play it with an emulator, it's a better experience.   Would of been good except they have no graphics options besides resoultion, it's stuck in a 4:3 screen and to get an Xbox One controller to work, you have to have the controller off and wait for the game to start for it to work.  It feels like the laziest port ever made and that's something coming from Square's track record on ports. Like wow it's that bad.  A shame considering FFIX is a terrific game but this isn't the way to experience it, atleast not yet."
"If I could get my money back for this game I would. Like others, the movement system is bugged. After re-loading a save none of the keyboard inputs for movement work, and the avatar moves around on their own. After restarting the game a couple of times I've resigned myself to not being able to play this classic. Poor purchasing decision on my part, but an even worse port on the developers part. It should not be the responsibility of the consumer to figure out work arounds for a buggy game."
"Sorry but this port is ♥♥♥, please Squenix gods patch this abomination."
I cant recommend this game at the moment with the controller issue. As soon as I get control of Zidane he walks himself forward and to the right and will not go in any other direction. No issues navigating menus though. Please fix!
I Really wanted to play it but couldn't stand the graphics. That remastered characters + pixelated scenarios mix makes it unplayable on 1440p.
There is a problem where the character always goes to the left. No matter what I do or if I am not pressing anything the character will go to the left. It is impossible to play the game
Character Keeps moving to the right have no control what so ever needs a fix
"this game is a buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥. do yourself a favor and buy a playstation and the original discs if you want to play it, because the movement is bugged as ♥♥♥♥. I cant turn left or right, and when I get to a city, my character runs constantly to the right, regardless of my input device."
"It's not as good as 7 or 8. It has a lot of downtime. Characters are always switching. When you get them back they are under leveled and they have to fight right away usually. The plots not that interesting. A lot of empty text that just goes on and on. The boss fights weren't interesting. The 'Trance' system, the limit break basically, is unpredictable and you end up wasting it in random fights instead of able to save it for boss fights or use as you want. The character 'classes' aren't exactly unique either with very minor changes. One thing after another, I've never beaten 9 and 20hrs in I can't see myself forcing myself too after it all. Going back to play 7-8 instead of this..."
"First review I have done on a game via Steam and most likely will be my last.  Why do I choose to withhold my recommendation? Simple, the game does not work. As soon at it gives you control of your character, he just takes off to the right like the wall is magnet and he is Iron Man's slightly stupid cousin. Forums claim it is an issue with the controller compatability, which is all well and good, minus me not using a controller.  Game is broken. I would not waste my time until it is patched, if ever in truth.  Get your crap together Square."
"I'm so torn at this. I can't even think straight. Okay this IS Final Fantasy 9. It IS playable to a degree. Let's look over pros and cons like good reviewers do:  Pros:  I CAN PLAY FF9 ON MY PC! (legally)  If I want just the story I can turn on and off boosts at will!  If I am a speed runner I can skip Cut scenes at will (may end up not being allowed but my also become a separate category)   The MOVING sprites look good.   There is some VERY smooth HIGH FPS moments...  Some music was redone and may or may not have been improved?(this is a pro and a con here)  Cons:  Tetra Master is almost unplayable. The sound effects tear through your ears like a mad hornet. No wait give me the hornet at least it would be over quickly... Same for equipping items...  They made certain parts of the game EASIER. IE Impressing the crowd. Had speed runners tell me BS that was a 89! How the hell did you get 100!  FRAME RATE DROPS RANDOMLY! I have a card that is DOUBLE the specs needed to play this. Hell my computer is almost 4 times as powerful as it needs to be to play this AND I stream it WHY AM I DROPPING 60% frames!? Seriously Smooth  60 FPS BOOM 10. Only for a moment but it's so often you WILL notice it...  Even with changes made Bugs like the Thunder Slash 0% accuracy issue from the PSone are still being reported meaning they didn't even fix bugs from 16 years ago they have been fully aware of...   DO NOT PAUSE AND BUMP A SHOULDER BUTTON! You WILL turn on full hp/mp/trance and if you are doing ANY legit play through speed run or stream you will be boned...  The MOVING sprites were changed and made HD. The backgrounds? ♥♥♥♥ poor copy and paste from the PSX hell an  emulator and a filter plug in looks BETTER then this port AND THEY WERE MADE YEARS AGO!  Some music MAY be better. Some isn't...  THIS PORT MADE ME CRY! But it is Square Enix porting a FF game I was expecting too.   I am a streamer...I plan to speed run this...I am going to have to choose to either A force myself to hear and see ♥♥♥♥ for 100s of hours or B use an emulated copy that half the speed run community WON'T allow... Or C...Which is my current option...I can't get a refund after the (currently 5 hours as of writing this) amount of time I have played but I will get the achievements, silent uninstall this 'Port', and then hope and PRAY some one makes a good mod/SE will *Laughs Hysterically* I can't even type it without that sorry...Make a patch that fixes this crap. But I think they are more focused on remakes no one wants and games no one cares about to even think about patching this crap...  TL;DR Save your memories of this game and break out your PS1/2/3 and get it on there... Your wallet, your childhood, your tear ducts will thank you...   If anything does get changed I will update this review...I'm not holding my breath..."
"Crash, Crash, Crash, Crash, Crash.......Crash.......  It's a cell phone port, probably works better on cell phone over PC, should've bought on PS3 instead"
"do not recomend, lost all my saves casue they f.ucked up with save location."
"More story than game. In the time I played there were 7 batlles, all very easy. Beautiful graphics, but not what I would call a game -- hence the 'No.'"
The game doesn't have analog sensitive. Even in the PS1 version i could have a smoother walk.  What about the audio? Port from Android version with audio compress? The audio quality is horrible!
"It's 2016. I'm in my late twenties, and while this was the game to play in the 2000's It's HARD NOT to be desensitized to this type of JRPG. Was playing FF8 back in 2010 on the ps3 cool? Yes. This port in my opinion came way too late. While the nostalgia is cool, I cant help but feel like I have to push myself to ge through the game. It was FUN back then  It's a good game, but meh, waste of $20 in my opinion...too many other JRPG'S out there, to be forcing myself to play some nostalgia FF.  Better things to do with my time...."
It has been altered.  Can't even get the jump rope cards cause the visual cues are messed up. Also can't customize controls other than using Alphanumerical keys. Waste of time.  If they were only going to half ♥♥♥ it they probably should have not released it.
"Not into this FF game at all. It plays and looks as if it were intended to be enjoyed by children with weird furry character art, wack plot/storyline, terrible and predictable battle sequence, and it's overall just very creepy and strange."
"The graphics that have been replaced, and those that haven't combine into what looks like a camera focused on characters, and an awful cell phone watercolor filter on everything else.  It looks like deficate. My eyes cannot focus on anything, and I have to look for things that should be clear. Like doorways. This version of the game is aesthetically jarring to say the absolute least. Why give the option for 1080p(or higher in my case), if backgrounds are ~240p?  The controls are a bit wonky too. Every time I end a conversation, my character walks left until I hit another direction on the controller(xbox 360).   Don't even get me started on the boosters. There's limited grinding in this game to begin with. WTF are you actually doing SqareEnix? Are timed sections pointless now? Why would you do this?  Honestly, the graphics are the only real issue here. Boosters? I won't use them. And I can live with glitchy controls until they effect gameplay negatively. Immersion was never a thing with FF games. But seriously, why did you have to dissapoint me with a game this good being such an eyesore.   Updating the review to nominate it for the 'I'm not crying...' award. Because it makes me sad I paid for this POS."
"Retro gaming is fun. That is, when you're actually playing a game. FFIX is NOT a GAME. Its a cutscene machine where you sometimes play a game. It's filled to the brim with QTEs (even if they don't bill them as such), soap opera expository scenes, and endless amounts of filler crap. I spent about 1/4th of the time 'playing' FFIX actually playing the game. Most of the time, you're subjegated to endless amounts of inane prattle between the 'characters'.  If you want to play a game, do not buy this. If you want to watch an anime, do not buy this. If you want your mother (or legal guardian) to clean the spittle from your chin for hours on end... Buy this.  Pro: Its a shining example of what not to do. Ever. This is 'gaming' at pure putrification. Purchase at your own risk."
"+Hd models +Keyboard and Xbox 360 controller support +Improved text quality  -Frame rate runs smooth while running around but drops to 10-30 when battles start like your still playing it on ps1 even on a GTX 970 -Backgrounds and many foreground objects have poor quality which look like paper cutouts and next to HD 3d models making it look like a puppet theater -Certain cutscenes that use 3d models like the begining of Vivi's section are ripped straight from the ps1  I like how its smooth when out and running around but it severly cripples it for me when battles start and breakpads are digging into my eyeballs. I didnt play it long but you might enjoy this if you never got to play it on ps1 or dont mind how 3d hd models look wonky next to paper cut out environment objects with slideshow framerate battles, I just dont think its worth anymore than 15$ at this time."
"TL;DR: A very lazy port made by people who had zero passion for the original game. Not recommended.  First time I did a refund for a game on Steam. This port is of very low quality and destroyed my attempt to jump on the nostalgia train.  First off, game assets vary A LOT in quality. The prerendered backgrounds look blurry and have a laughable low resolution, while some of the main characters got new textures and poly count. The end result is a very uneven experience, where the characters feels artificial in relation to the environment.  Second, the game pad support is quite buggy and totally ignores joystick sensitivity. The latter could easily been fixed. Don't tell me that this is part of the nostalgia - it is simply just bad.  Third, the ugly grey background filler is just terrible. I really don't mind the game being in a 4:3 format, but why use an awful grey texture as filler? It would just be better with black/no texture."
"I have been eagerly awaiting this remake for so long, excited that maybe SE wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ up one of their remakes for once, but no they found a way.  Playing with a controller is impossible as there are no settings to fix Zidane from moving permanently in one direction, or using the dpad to navigate menus. It's an extremely lazy port of the Android version, which SE refused to refund me despite having the exact same problem with the controllers there. Thankfully, Steam is much easier to get a refund from.  Come on Square Enix, pay attention to defails for once. Please. This isn't that hard and it completely ruins the experience of playing your games."
the borders just the borders hate them so much
game is stuck i just unlocked heydra or whatever and my characther wont stop running to the right on his own but like the game will rate positive once fixed
"Game was broken, stucking moving right, will try again once its been patched.  Yet another badly ported FF game."
Doesn't play well on a keyboard.
"Until they fix the bug that makes your character constantly move to the right, I cant recommend this game. Its unplayable for me.  Xbox 360 wired controller. "
"FF IX is a great game. If you like FF games or enjoyed playing before its worth 10 or 15 bucks to a fan. If you are not a fan or have never played, save your money. Maybe get it on sale. While the movies and player models are 'HD' the game its self is not, it doesnt display in widescreen and the enviorments and backgrounds are not HD at all, with the HD models and the crappy enviorments and backgrounds it makes it hard to see where you are going or what youre supossed to do."
"While the game itself ran ok and I know what FF games are like as I played many in the past on consoles, I was under the impression this was a remake for the PC with all high res, but the backgrounds in the aventure screen is very low res and blurry, look terrible, I thought those were remade as well. Another problem is they are using a hand held menu system for battles, so the menus kind of get in the way of what you are looking at. If you are really desperate to play FFIX then ok, but I can't recommend it, I end up refunding the game. "
"Possibly the worst port of a game ever released. I had the 'always walk right' bug. Spent 15 minutes fixing that, Then it asks me for Vivi's name. Its blank, wont let me type anything in, and my game is now stuck because I cant complete this screen.  Unplayable."
refunded till they sort out the constant walking right bug &gt;.&lt;
"No traditional chinese, no japanese, make me depressed."
"doesn't work, always scrolls down. can't find fix, refunding."
Janky controller support. I have to unplug the controller before playing then plug back in for it to work. If you play in window mode the game looks OK. But at full screen 1080p the uprezzed models and the SD backdrops look like you need glasses to see this clearly. On a 7 inch tablet it would look great but on a 22in screen its crap. I love the story and music but this is just a lazy port of the Android edition NOT a proper PC port. ( Mind you this and FF6 were by far my favorite titles) but a emulator runs this better than this does
"My review on this game is more neutral than negative, while there are very prominent negatives, it's still the game we all know and love at its base. It's sad that I have to say no to the recommendation as it's my favourite Final Fantasy, but I am really only targetting this version specifically. So let me get right to the issues I have about it.  IX was actually quite unpopular on its initial release, VIII just followed VII (arguably the most popular of the franchise) but IX received barely any marketing and followed up on something that wasn't quite as impressive as VII. That means that for people who DID manage to play it, especially in their childhood, it is generally held close as some sort of exclusive thing they have over others. A lot of us had a love for this game that made us seek challenges, theories and trivia. Eventually this lead to the creation level 1 perfect Excalibur II challenge that any old IX fan SHOULD know about. This version of the game comes with boosts, and even though you don't have to use them - they're there and it makes the game feel like there's no need to put effort into it anymore. What's the point in doing that challenge anymore? It destroys the charm of the game, even though I admit that the encounter rate, loading times etc were all horrible aspects that the boosts can erase.  For first time buyers, I suggest playing the original IX on an emulator or through PSN. The game isn't hard at all, but what's important about it is the experience of a really nice story. But you want some kind of difficulty, and you want to evade the temptation to just access boosts. Unless you're on a time restriction, that is.  For veterans or old fans of the game, it's prettier. That's it. That's all you are getting here. You may be able to fulfill your dream of 100% perfect runs, but it's an empty achievement. If that's your thing though then be my guest and play it with all the boosts, because you're essentially paying for maybe 12 - 15 hours of gameplay with no sense of achievement. Even without the boosts, the fact they're there almost invalidates your entire game file. If you do just want to play through without them, then I don't see a problem. Your love for IX can only become greater when you experience the graphics updates in this version, but in all honesty you might be better off just watching some videos of that instead.  I have replayed IX so much and this is the first time I actually didn't enjoy myself, but I think a large portion of that is my own salt over people not experiencing what I had. So I do admit that my perception of this version may be a little warped, as I'm sure most reviews etc are coming from new players, those who never attempted or completed the perfect run and got to experience everything as new even if it's been tainted by boosts etc. Again, I absolutely love this game but I feel like the boosts were a horrible addition and instead they should have altered specific variable instead of allowing access to massive cheats."
"Just started playing, Something is stuck my character will only walk to the right, tried reboot, unplugged keyboard and/or controller, neither works, zidane is just walking into a wall, no way to control the character, initial reviews say right now the game is full of glitches and I belive that, wish I had read them before I bought the game."
I had fun playing it until the dragging story started at the mid to end of the game. FFs are supposed to have a good story but this is really a drag.  Spoiler:     THe end is just brainless nonsense. Unnecessary! A entity appears out of no where which tells about humanity destructive nature and wants to destroy everything. No connection at all.   
"FF9 is an awesome game, but for now I cannot recommend it. Many people (myself included) are having game breaking issues with using game controllers with this. Seems to be really hit or miss for people. Hopefully they get it fixed quick."
"unbelievable. i got FF7 and FF8 on steam. both games worked just fine. this one however, is completely broken for me. i cannot use a gamepad at all. the option is there, but it is completely glitching out on me when i try to use it. the character just runs to the left side of the screen. if i bring up a menu, it flips between options like it has a mind of its own. i actually started up bioshock infinite just to test the controller to make sure there wasnt an issue with the controller itself. nope. controller is fine. this game just has something seriously wrong with it. i did not have this problem with FF7 or FF8. so what happened here? how did they screw this up so bad? i cant imagine i am the only one dealing with this issue."
We'll it seems they messed up big time with the controller use. I doubt they will even get a patch within any good time frame. Just wasted my time and money even getting this game after not playing it for years. I am not very happy the way there treating the PC ports anymore.
It loads and it's the game however the badly pixelated backgrounds and the flickering cgi scenes gave me a headache after only a few minutes.
"first ever review   for now the game is to buggy on my end just loading any kind of save file be it auto or moggle save file. the game acts on its own be it fleeing fom battle, world map turning on its own, walking one way and putting a wall preventing me from going the other way. I tried to disable my human interface devices it did not work. so do not buy the game or play untill the bugs are ever fixed stick to the old school bad graphic bug free version on the ps1"
"Oh my god, the controlls are a horrible piece of garbage. How is it not possible to customize the direction keys? Umlaut keys are not recognized and can't be assigned anything. While trying to assign keys, focus sometimes randomly goes away and I have to close and reopen the key customization window. The whole thing feels like an underpaid interns first go at user interface design.   Went in expecting a lot from my ALL TIME FAVOURITE GAME only to be slapped in the face right away."
"I'll give it a thumbs up when they take away the filthy disgusting borders, or give me the option to remove or replace with black bars. Delayed 4 months for PC and you didn't fix that. I don't care if it's not perfect, give me the option to go wide. I'll take a smash-faced Quina, squashed mess Vivi, anything is better than this portrait of game.   And how does a company of your stature let a SUPER LOW RES borders be brighter than what's on screen? Never experienced borders that actually detracted from a game, cut scenes and I'm drawn to the borders. Seriously I don't mind normal black bar borders, I play CS:GO in 4:3, not bothered. But just know this is a gradient, super low resolution tan,grey, beige office clown fiesta. Not unplayable, but severly ruining the gameplay.  And to be clear, it's not just that they are office colored hellscapes; these borders don't form straight lines down. It's jagged hellscape where not even your focus will survive. JUST GIVE ME A NORMAL BLACK BORDER instead, It's a sloppy, ugly, unpleasing fade. Like if M J Fox was your barber you'd get that on the side of your head. And proceed to not leave the house for a week.    All the hours played now will be attempts to remove the 1999 Wolfenstien border textures they've 'innovated' into my beloved childhood game.  Yes, make me do your work Square. You bunch of lazy, cash grab ♥♥♥♥♥. Did you think we'd be okay with forced 4:3 in 2016. Now please tell me how you listen, and understand your playerbase. "
"PLEASE, RESIST THE URGE TO BUY THIS!!! (Even if you love this game as i do)  I've been buying and trying to play Final Fantasy's PC ports for 3 times now. I've done it with FF7 and met an unfinished, lazy port straight from mobile and had controller problems with an xbox controller. I've done it with FF8 and met an unfinished, lazy port straight from mobile and had controller problems with an xbox controller. I've done it with FF9 and met an unfinished, lazy port straight from mobile and had controller problems with an xbox controller (this time i couldn't get it to work).  No more Square, i will not let you have my money this time. I'm requesting a refund, despite my love for this game i refuse to support your cheap tatics to make a quick buck out of our childhoods. This game is a sorry excuse for a cash grab, they won't add propper xinput support, they won't add exclusive PC options and they won't give you a s****.  I will try to resist the urge to buy another Final Fantasy port ever again."
"I can't recommend the game until they fix the controller issues. I have zero issues with any other game in my library while using KB/M or my wireless xbox 360 controller. This game however only allows the controlled character to move to the right, the ONLY way around this is to use the D-Pad on the 360 controller and even then i have to fight the right direction which causes some extreme issues while trying to navigate. Troubleshooting I've attempted: Using only KB/M with no controller or receiver plugged in - right turn only KB/M with receiver plugged in - right turn only KB/M with receiver and controller on - right turn only Removed any unused HID devices in device manager - right turn only Unplugged keyboard, used controller with mouse and reciever plugged in - right turn only Unplugged mouse, used controller with keyboard and receiver plugged in - right turn only Updated all drivers associated with controller, keyboard, and mouse - right turn only before and after driver updates  Once the control issues are fixed, the game was always a favorite and the updated graphics look smoother."
"Worse then I remember I can’t get past how disingenuous and uninteresting the main character and villain is, the plot is terrible, and the graphics are kind of cartoony and really off putting. I love all the other final fantasy’s especially 6, 7, 8 and 10 but I can’t with good conscious recommend this one."
"Doesnt work with xbox one controller 30 frames cap ingame 4:3 Aspect Ratio  Uses the mobile HUD version, so it sucks that i cant see all the chars in the fight scene  Everything elese works fine  Seriously Its a broken port in the first day... thanks square enix you dont learn...."
"Square Enix, please stop killing my Hopes and Dreams...   -'Cinematic' 15 on FMV and 30 FPS on game -Crappy 'HD', probably taken directly from the PS1, only the 3D chars have a HD retextures -No WideScreen support? 4:3 on 2016? really?  Sorry, but will ask for refund on this, search for my old PS1 Disks and Emulate it, I bet it will be a lot better experience than this crappy port."
"Fan of final fantasy. Played all of them from 1 to 13. (Tactics and some spin offs too) This game it's not worth 20 bucks. The only thing they do was make the characters sharper, a UI that just don't fit the art style of the game and add trophies. Backgrounds are destroyed. If you want to see backgrounds like they should look you must play in a 800X600 resolution. It's my favorite final fantasy. But it's 15 years old and giving $20 for the same game it's not worth it in my opinion. Just wait for a sale. Don't let them play with your nostalgia."
Probably alright with a controler but a major pain using a pc keyboard.Way to long between savepoints. Gave me a headace
"Even though this is the classic Final Fantasy 9, this port is 30 FPS locked, and the FMV have a 'cinematic' 15 FPS.  Only the 3D models have had retexturing, everything is a copy of the PSX classic (Btw, this is a port of the Tablet game).  Tl;DR: Get this on an emulator, you will get a better experience."
"Oh my god this cake is insanely good! I mean look at the shape, it's accurately cut, and the ingredients are perfectly placed and cooked! They're also high quality, making this cake even more delicious!   Oh, but look, the cake's holder is a bit weird...."
"Is this a joke? 2 extras months of waiting (aside from the 16 years PC users waited) to get an straight port of the Android version, with not even widescreen or proper controller support. Not to mention, constant crashes! Really Enix-Square, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.  UPDATE: As always, Enix-Square didnt fix ♥♥♥♥ (except releasing a 3GB patch that didnt do anything), but people in the forums did. If you set the game to compatibility mode with Windows 98, the game stops crashing, so you can actually play it.  Port itself its ok, the 3D models look a lot better, but they made the backgrounds look terrible. The auto-save option is a cool adition, but still looks like they put that option in for the crashes.  About the game, is the best Final Fantasy ever made, simple as that. Is this port worth $20 bucks? nope, unless you never played it, and dont have a PS1 laying around to play the original. If you already played the game to death, and only want this game on PC so you dont have to hook up your PS1 every time you wanna play it, then wait for a sale.  UPDATE 24/5/2016: Enix decided to patch the game so 'the fix' wont work anymore, the game is unplayable again. ♥♥♥♥ YOU."
"I'm going to keep this short because I never thought I would see the day in which I have to write a bad review for FFIX. The original is a true masterpiece, one of the best JPRGs...no, one of the best games ever developed. From the characters, the plot, the graphics, the amazing soundtrack, the ability system, and of course Tetra Master...SO GOOD.  With that said, this port is a load of sh*t. How bad is it? It's so bad I couldn't even get through the title screen. And I mean this by the most literal sense.  First, there is no option to customize controller input. When you start the game the X (confirm) and O (cancel) buttons are the Japanese variant and there's no way for you to change it. C'mon, serious? This is just plain lazy. I'm using a Xbox 360 controller by the way.  Second, there is no 'Quit Game' option in the title menu as well. I have to Ctrl + Alt + Del to quit this DAS (dumb as sh*t) port. Fu*king embarrassing.  By the way, the only options you get are windowed mode and resolution settings. Yup, that's all. Square can get away with this because the IP carries so much weight. Sigh...another day another sh*tty a*s port."
"I was waiting in anticipation on this game; Finally it comes to PC! With some better character models etc! Unfortionately I'm VERY disappointed as this is a port of the mobile version that came out earlier this year... So for those saying this isn't a port, your wrong! The game might be good even if it's a port from the mobile version, but unfortionately I'm not able to play it at this time. I never liked playing my FF games with mouse and keyboard, so naturally I choose to connect an Xbox One controller (it's more comfy than a PS3 controller, and easier to setup). This does not work well, as the character starts running off to the left of the screen and gets stuck there, no matter what way I try to push the stick... I was really hoping of enjoying this today (or tomorrow on my birthday), but looks like I gotta wait some more. Was also hoping to get an option to enable widescreen, but doesn't seem like that's gonna happen either. Truly disappointed and hoping for a fix for at least the controller soon. If that gets fixed, I'll edit this review to positive."
"This game is my favourite ever. That should be enough surely. I can't recommend this highly enough.   Or so you would think. The PC upgraded version has left a slightly sour taste in my mouth. Especially in regards to the price. I believe we are being charged over the odds for what is a carbon copy of their mobile release that i believe sells for £11.99 compared to £15.99 for this version.   There are mostly high resolution characters. I say mostly due to one part as seen in part 1 of my playthrough that I'll link below. But as evidenced by Final Fantasy 7 and 8 where i always felt the backgrounds looks very pretty compared to the models, this time we have the opposite. The backgrounds so far look like they have had no improvement what so ever.   And some how they can't improve the aspect ratio...   It feels very lazy for its premium (relative) price.   A few personal points on the game I'm not keen on.   - Mobile Style UI interface - Cluttered Title Screen - No PS4 Controller Prompts - GAME BOOSTERS :/  - That Crappy Card I was given at the start of the game....   Overall I love this game for it's story and characters. However I'd like you all to hear my gripes before you, yourself go out and buy it. Hence why I am down voting. If you've never played it before however, then I would implore you to experience the story.

"Minor glitches, Characters look fine. But the menu system is tacky IMO, I much prefered the old one. The battle sequences are extreamly low FPS, Looks like about 15fps. The regular game seems to be about 30fps. If you have the ps1 game, just emulate it."
"Ahh, Final Fantasy 9. We meet on PC at last.  So it's a port, of a port. Not that bad. But not the best either.   HD models are nice. The backgrounds could have used a little work, but they are still pretty decent, considering.  Locked at 30 FPS, locked at 4:3 aspect ratio, which causes massive screen tearing. No V-Sync, and not even an option to turn it on. Bummer.  Battle menu was a little clunky, but no worse the the PS1 version.   The big flaw. The BIG one.   The cutscene going into Alexandria, before you take control of Vivi.   The NPC's are still PS1 graphics. They ripped the scene straight from the PS1, and slapped it in this HD version. That's just lazy. They had plenty of time to fix that, and even the models are there! They're peppered all throughout the town, but they chose to be lazy. The mobile version launched in or around Feburary. They could have easily done more.   All in all, it's a mediocre port of a port, of a game made in 2000. If you're a die hard fan, you'll love it. You'll look past all the lazy and see it as an amazing piece of your childhood. If you're new to the franchise, and want to play the old stuff? Just pick up a copy at your local used game place. Or Emulate.   So close, yet so far."
What a waste of money
"STAY AWAY.  Really really sad that I have to say this on one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles but this game, at least for me, just constantly crashes. Boss fight? crash. Cutscene? crash. Random battle? crash. Moving? crash.   UNPLAYABLE.  I would gladly ask for a refund if I could.  Note: tried every possible solution with no results.  Maybe next time give the port to someone who knows his job. Livid."
"This is a port of the mobile version.   The graphics are awful. What a disappointment. Everything in the background is completly muddy and the FMV movies look awful.   There is even huge lag before every fight with a modern computer.   Finally it is 4:3, not even formatted for modern screens.   What a piece of Moogle doodoo  "
"Disappointing. It's a good port, but the base game wasn't that great to begin with.  Final Fantasy IX, 'goes back to the roots of the Final Fantasy series', which root? The classic Final Fantasy should be about the four Warriors of Light with special power from the mother crystals, going on a journey to save the world. Final Fantasy IX doesn't have the crystal nor the job system. It's more like FFIV and VI where characters have unique job and abilities.  The setting feels more like a Disney cartoon where you have animals pretending to be human. The plot is about a princess who ran away from the castle with a thief. That princess also starts singing out of nowhere just like every Disney's princesses. Not that Disney is bad but it doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game.  The characters are so generic. You have the princess, the monkey thief, the knight, the black mage, and the rest is irrelevant characters who barely have anything to do with the main story.  The battle system is very slow. Even with the new option in this port that allow you to remove the intro before battles but the battle itself is still slow. It also has a huge lag before battles in this port. Trance is the worst 'limit break' system I've ever seen. A finishing move that you cannot choose when to use? really?  The character developmental system is not good. Maybe worse than FFVIII's Junction system. In FFIX you'll be forced to use inferior equipment in order to learn character abilities. It's annoying.  The card game is not as good as Triple Triad from FFVIII, and other minigames are boring.  The soundtracks are fine. I like many of them.  The port is very well done. I worried a bit because they ported it from Android version but it runs perfectly on my system. The graphics look fine, the new battle menu doesn't cause any issue to me so far. The 4:3 ratio with stupid side bars is lame though.  7/10 for the port.  5.5/10 for the base game. A decent JRPG but not that great.  2/10 for the FFIX fans who kept hating on people who don't think FFIX is the best of all-time. You people need to calm down and learn that people can have different opinions."
